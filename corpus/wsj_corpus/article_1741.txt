rep. mary rose oakar -lrb- d. , ohio -rrb- at last week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the department of housing and urban development : i do n't want to feel guilty representing my constituents . and if i think that some people -lcb- on hud secretary jack kemp 's -rcb- staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown , i have to tell you something -- i 'm not going to take it . i think that i 'm elected to represent the people that sent me here . and one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area . and if we 're not ombudsman for our area , we ought to be thrown out of office . on the other hand , if we 're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story . but if i feel that there are situations where i 'm trying to get housing for our area -- whatever it happens to be -- and i have to feel that i ca n't even ask a question , i 've got to tell you , 0 i think 0 that 's outrageous . . i think 0 these regulations that would prohibit well-operated programs in areas across this country would be wrong 0 to change ... . i do n't want to see some guidelines change that 's going to inhibit my city 's opportunity to use its money .
