a group of investors , including giancarlo parretti 's pathe communications corp. and sasea holding s.a. , have agreed to buy 76.66 % of odeon finanziaria , a financially troubled italian tv station . florio fiorini , managing director of geneva-based sasea , said 0 the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station , `` but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating . it 's sort of a chapter 11 situation , '' he added , referring to the u.s. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure . milan-based odeon , which draws about 3 % of italian tv viewers , has debt of 250 billion lire -lrb- $ 181.9 million -rrb- , mr. fiorini said 0 . he added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out , but that pathe will take 50 % of odeon , rome film producer bruno lucisano will take 10 % and the remaining 16.66 % , currently owned by sasea , will eventually be sold to other investors . calisto tanzi , odeon 's owner , will retain his 23.34 % stake . italy 's supreme court this year ordered parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership . `` we think that it 's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward , '' mr. fiorini said .
