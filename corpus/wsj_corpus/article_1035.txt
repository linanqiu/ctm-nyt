president bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test 0 to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority . mr. bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto , which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill . he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . but some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged mr. bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto . such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power . white house spokesman marlin fitzwater , confirming comments made this week by vice president dan quayle , said 0 mr. bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test case . but he also said that exercising a test line-item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the president 's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment .
