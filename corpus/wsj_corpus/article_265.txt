healthcare international inc. said 0 it reached a 120-day standstill agreement with its healthvest affiliate calling for healthcare to pay healthvest $ 5 million right away and additional amounts in the future . under the agreement , healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said 0 it would pay healthvest $ 3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ 1.1 million in funds that healthvest advanced for construction work on facilities . in return , healthvest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and remedies against healthcare during the 120-day period . after the payment , healthcare still will be $ 6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to healthvest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by healthcare . healthcare has given healthvest a 12 % note for that overdue amount , 0 to be repaid over three years . in addition , healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ 2.7 million to $ 3 million to healthvest during the standstill period , 0 to be paid when healthcare successfully completes asset sales . because healthcare actually owes healthvest $ 4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note . the funds should help ease a cash bind at healthvest , which has been unable to pay its debts because healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since july . a spokesman said 0 healthvest has paid two of the three banks 0 it owed interest to in october and is in negotiations with the third bank . healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity bind , said 0 it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with greenery rehabilitation group inc. in which greenery purchased stock and warrants for $ 500,000 and loaned healthcare $ 9 million . the loan is backed by healthcare 's 5.4 % stake in healthvest and interest in certain facilities .
