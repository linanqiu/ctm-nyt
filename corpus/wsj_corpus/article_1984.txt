rep. lee hamilton -lrb- d. , ind . -rrb- said 0 he and rep. byron dorgan -lrb- d. , n.d . -rrb- are backing away from their proposal to make the treasury secretary a voting member of the federal reserve panel that sets monetary policy . rep. hamilton said 0 the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the fed 's open market committee and the treasury secretary , the chairman of the council of economic advisers and the director of the office of management and budget . the original bill was strongly opposed by the fed and publicly criticized by friends of the fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy . rep. hamilton said 0 the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the fed . '' fed chairman alan greenspan meets regularly for lunch with treasury secretary nicholas brady and talks frequently with budget director richard darman and michael boskin , chairman of the council of economic advisers . the administration officials do n't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee .
