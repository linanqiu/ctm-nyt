kaufman & broad home corp. said 0 it formed a $ 53.4 million limited partnership subsidiary 0 to buy land in california suitable for residential development . the partnership , kaufman & broad land development venture limited partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of heitman advisory corp. , a unit of heitman financial corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills , calif . kaufman & broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors . the land 0 to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of kaufman & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals . the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said 0 bruce karatz , president and chief executive officer of kaufman & broad . `` there are really very few companies that have adequate capital 0 to buy properties in a raw state for cash . typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said mr. karatz , adding that he believes 0 the joint venture is the first of its kind . `` we usually operate in that conservative manner . '' by setting up the joint venture , kaufman & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , mr. karatz said 0 . the company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture . `` this is one of the best ways 0 to assure a pipeline of land 0 to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' mr. karatz said .
