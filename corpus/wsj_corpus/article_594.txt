the singapore and kuala lumpur stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation , following malaysian finance minister daim zainuddin 's long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties . on friday , datuk daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on malaysia 's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the kuala lumpur stock exchange `` to take appropriate action immediately '' to cut its links with the stock exchange of singapore . the delisting of malaysian-based companies from the singapore exchange may not be a smooth process , analysts say 0 . though the split has long been expected , the exchanges are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways . the finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries . rather , the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years , with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings , separate and different listing requirements , differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims .
