the tennessee valley authority issued $ 4 billion in bonds in the federal utility 's first public debt offering in 15 years . proceeds from the bonds , with coupon rates in the 8 % range , will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1 % . the tva said 0 the refinancing should save $ 75 million a year in interest payments . the refinancing is part of the tva 's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem : its staggering $ 18.5 billion debt , most of which is owed to the treasury department 's federal financing bank . the tva currently plans to issue a total of $ 6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt . the $ 4 billion bond issue also will help the tva meet its goal of not raising rates for another year , said 0 william f. malec , the agency 's chief financial officer . the bond issue is tva 's first public offering since the financing bank was created in 1974 , primarily to finance the tva . but the offering almost did n't happen . the tva , in fact , decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the financing bank , which allows tva to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market . the treasury contended that tva could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market . the $ 4 billion in bonds break down as follows : $ 1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25 % and a yield to maturity of 8.33 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375 % and a yield to maturity of 8.42 % ; $ 2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection , a coupon rate of 8.75 % and a yield to maturity of 9.06 % . managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by first boston corp. and co-managed by goldman , sachs & co. , merrill lynch capital markets , morgan stanley & co. , and salomon brothers inc .
