's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations . the charlotte , n.c. , company said 0 earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier . the latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp . the strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans , particularly in the southeast . in the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter . nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter . included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which ncnb said 0 it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . '' the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in ncnb 's southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign . the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier . in big board composite trading yesterday , ncnb jumped $ 3.50 a share , to $ 51 . results were released after the market closed . ncnb texas national , formed from the remnants of of the failed first republicbank corp. of dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter . ncnb said 0 its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the texas operation since aug. 1 . ncnb raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the ncnb texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise . last week , the banking company said 0 it purchased both freedom savings & loan association , tampa , fla. , and university federal savings association of san antonio , texas , for $ 169.4 million . in the first nine months , ncnb 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier . security pacific corp . security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans . net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year earlier . the company said 0 the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -lrb- mainly residential -rrb- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . these high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease . as a result , security pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings . security pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 , down 37.5 cents , in big board composite trading . the earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for security pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity . the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market . security pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ 81.9 million in the year-ago period . nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago . security pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before . non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of hong kong banking operations . non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period . for the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million , or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 469.4 million , or $ 4.13 a share , a year earlier .
