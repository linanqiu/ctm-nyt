when robert mcduffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in macon , ga . unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by itzhak perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending . `` i threw such a fit , '' says mr. mcduffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six . `` but once perlman started playing , i did n't give a damn about basketball ... . afterwards , i went home and practiced for three hours . '' today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice . at 31 , mr. mcduffie has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule . he 's currently in the midst of a 17-city u.s. tour with yehudi menuhin and the warsaw sinfonia , with stops including charleston , s.c . -lrb- oct. 25 -rrb- , sarasota , fla . -lrb- oct. 28 -rrb- , tampa , fla . -lrb- oct. 29 -rrb- and miami -lrb- oct. 31 -rrb- . later this season he gives a recital at washington 's kennedy center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras . yet mr. mcduffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries . during the late 1970s , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the juilliard school with the noted pedagogue dorothy delay . his violin classmates included shlomo mintz , a protege of isaac stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; cho-liang lin , who joined the roster of icm artists inc. at the age of 18 ; and nadja salerno-sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 naumberg competition . `` i thought 0 i was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls mr. mcduffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light southern drawl . `` but i was n't ready for a career at that time . '' young mcduffie 's first violin teacher was henrik schwarzenberger , a hungarian refugee who taught in the macon public school system . `` he taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician . `` i did n't learn to count until i got to juilliard . '' after studies at that conservatory 's pre-college division with an assistant to the legendary instructor ivan galamian , he switched at the college level to miss delay , mr. galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival . `` i think 0 i had to prove myself to her , '' says mr. mcduffie . `` but she was always encouraging . she only put her foot down twice , '' he continues . `` in my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal . she thought 0 i was n't getting my practicing done . '' as the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` you 've just got to get the -lcb- expletive deleted -rcb- out of there . ' '' the second incident took place after mr. mcduffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself . miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital . `` we listened to the chausson ` poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` you hear the first note , that b-flat ? that 's the only note that 's truly in tune ... ' . '' `` that 's the most important experience 0 i 've had with any teacher , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen . now , when i play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' it was also at juilliard that mr. mcduffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century american composers such as david diamond and samuel barber . after winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` violin concerto , '' mr. mcduffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer . `` barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment . `` he did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score . there 's a beautiful , coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement ... the only time 0 the violin has it is right at the end . it 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and i played it that way , kind of gigue-like . and he yelled out ` dolce ! dolce ! ' -lcb- ` sweet ! sweet ! ' -rcb- . '' `` so we did it over , '' he adds . `` i played very transparently , with the tip of the bow . if a conductor is sensitive enough 0 to bring down the orchestra -lcb- volume -rcb- at that point , it makes the piece magical . i do n't know why barber never told anybody else . on isaac stern 's recording it 's very biting . '' since leaving juilliard , mr. mcduffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones . his guest appearance on the nbc soap opera `` another world , '' scandalized musical elitists . by contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of william schuman 's `` violin concerto , '' which he recently recorded for angel\/emi along with leonard bernstein 's engaging `` serenade for violin solo , strings and percussion . '' mr. mcduffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works . aided by the fluid playing of the st. louis symphony under leonard slatkin 's direction , this `` serenade '' really swings . mr. schuman 's `` violin concerto , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` agitato , fervente . '' but there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani . at avery fisher hall here , mr. mcduffie was heard recently with mr. menuhin and the warsaw sinfonia in more conventional fare -- bruch 's overwrought `` violin concerto in g minor . '' his performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed . the 35-member sinfonia played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size . whatever he plays , mr. mcduffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the manhattan apartment 0 he shares with wife , camille , a literary publicist . `` a normal person did not write the beethoven ` violin concerto , ' '' he declares . `` even when i hear it played badly , i 'm still humbled by the piece . if i could ever feel 0 i 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it .
