after a bad start , treasury bonds were buoyed by a late burst of buying to end modestly higher . `` the market was pretty dull '' for most of the day , said 0 robert h. chandross , vice president at lloyds bank plc . he said 0 some investors were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week , especially friday 's potentially market-moving employment report . during the first hour of trading yesterday , prices fell as much as 1\/4 point , or down about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . but market activity was energized as investors started to view the lower price levels as attractive . and the treasury 's $ 17.6 billion auction of short-term bills , which generated strong buying interest , helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums . `` we saw good retail demand by small banks , individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced '' late in the day , said 0 sung won sohn , senior vice president and chief economist at norwest corp. , minneapolis . he said 0 the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due this week will be `` conducive to a bond market rally . '' the employment report , which will provide the first official measure of the economy 's strength in october , is expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs . other key economic indicators due this week include today 's release of the september leading indicators index and new-home sales . tomorrow , the october purchasing managers report is due and on thursday comes october chain-store sales . despite yesterday 's modest bond market gains , economists say 0 investors are anxious about the treasury 's huge quarterly refunding of government debt , the timing of which depends on congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling . although the treasury will announce details of the november refunding tomorrow , it could be delayed if congress and president bush fail to increase the treasury 's borrowing capacity . the debt ceiling is scheduled to fall to $ 2.8 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion at midnight tonight . the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1\/8 point . mortgage-backed securities were up less than 1\/8 point and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged . strong demand for new york city 's $ 813 million general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market . traders said 0 most municipal bonds ended 1\/2 point higher . the new york city issue included $ 757 million of tax-exempt bonds priced to yield between 6.50 % to 7.88 % , depending on the maturity . the $ 56 million of new york 's taxable general obligation bonds were priced to yield between 9.125 % to 9.90 % . as expected , the longer-term tax-exempt new york bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long-term treasury bonds . the yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92 % . bond dealers said 0 the rates for the long-term tax-exempt new york city bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of treasury rates , for any new york city issue in recent memory . a spokesman for new york city comptroller harrison goldin said 0 the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainties . new york bonds , which have been hammered in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city 's economy is growing weaker , rose 1\/2 point yesterday . treasury securities treasury bonds ended slightly higher in light trading . the benchmark 30-year bond ended at 102 7\/32 0 to yield 7.92 % , compared with friday 's price of 102 2\/32 0 to yield 7.93 % . the latest 10-year notes ended at about 100 16\/32 0 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 11\/32 0 to yield 7.93 % on friday . short-term interest rates rose at the government 's regular weekly treasury-bill auction . the average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.78 % and the rate on six-month bills was 7.62 % . those rates are up from 7.52 % and 7.50 % , respectively , at last week 's auction . due to the treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at midnight tonight , yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales . the treasury bills sold yesterday settle today , rather than the standard settlement day of thursday . and because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity . because of the early settlement , the federal reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account . however , analysts expect the fed to buy treasury bills that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market . the treasury also held a hastily scheduled $ 2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday . here are details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction : rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . the percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . both issues are dated oct. 31 . the 13-week bills mature feb. 1 , and the 26-week bills mature may 3 , 1990 . here are details of yesterday 's 51-day cash management bill auction : interest rate 8.07 % the bills are dated oct. 31 and mature dec. 21 , 1989 . corporate issues the junk bond prices of western union corp. tumbled after the company said 0 it wo n't proceed with an exchange offer to holders of its reset notes . the upper saddle river , n.j. , communications firm said 0 it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high-yield market . in june , western union was forced to reset the interest rate on the senior secured notes due in 1992 to 19 1\/4 % from 16 1\/2 % , a move which increased the firm 's annual interest payments by $ 13.8 million . although the notes held at a price of 92 to 93 immediately after the reset , they started falling soon afterward . yesterday , western union 's senior secured reset notes fell 3 3\/4 points , or about $ 37.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to close at 50 1\/4 . other western union securities were also lower . the company 's 7.90 % sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of 14 1\/4 and an offered price of 30 , while the 10 3\/4 % subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for at 28 and offered at around 34 3\/4 . the 10 3\/4 % debentures last traded at 35 . high-yield traders said 0 spreads between the bid and offered prices of western union junk bonds have been widening for some time , and in certain cases , bids for western union securities are not available . elsewhere , prices of investment-grade and high-risk , high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged . in the new-issue market for junk securities , underwriters at salomon brothers inc. are expected to price today a $ 350 million junk bond offering by beatrice co. . the two-part issue consists of $ 200 million of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $ 150 million of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997 . portfolio managers said 0 expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of 13 3\/4 % and a yield of about 14 % . the chicago-based food and consumer goods concern was acquired in april 1986 in a $ 6.2 billion leveraged buy-out engineered by kohlberg kravis roberts & co . proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used by beatrice to redeem its $ 526.3 million principal amount of increasing rate debentures in august . meanwhile , underwriters at morgan stanley & co. are expected today to price a $ 350 million high-yield offering by continental cablevision inc . the senior subordinated debentures maturing in 2004 are targeted to be offered at a yield of between 12 5\/8 % to 12 3\/4 % . mortgage-backed securities mortgage securities ended 2\/32 to 4\/32 higher in light trading . ginnie mae 's 9 % issue for november delivery finished at 98 1\/2 , up 4\/32 , and its 10 % issue at 102 3\/8 , up 4\/32 . freddie mac 's 9 % issue ended at 97 19\/32 , up 2\/32 . in the derivative market , insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of remic securities , or real estate mortgage investment conduits , as they assess potential claims from the recent california earthquake and hurricane in the carolinas . this could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during the next few weeks . insurance companies have been major buyers of prepayment-protected planned amortization classes -lrb- pacs -rrb- during the past few months . the pacs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of freddie mac and fannie mae , quasi-federal agencies . in the asset-backed market , beneficial corp. offered $ 248 million of securities backed by home-equity loans , the second large deal in the past week . last week , a unit of mnc financial corp. offered $ 268 million of home-equity securities . both the mnc and beneficial offering were underwritten by merrill lynch capital markets , the leading wall street firm in the home-equity securities market , which was created early this year . municipal issues the improved tone in the municipal market , largely an offshoot of the new york city sale 's reception , helped municipal futures rebound from early lows , but the spread between the contract and tbond futures continued to grow more negative . the mob spread , or difference between the municipal and t-bond futures contracts , has been near all-time lows in recent trading , driven basically by concerns that new-issue supply would overwhelm demand . december municipal futures ended up 11\/32 point to 92-14 , having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded . but front month t-bond futures settled the afternoon session up a slightly greater 13\/32 at 99-04 . foreign bonds british government bonds ended moderately higher , encouraged by a steadier pound and a rise in british stocks . the benchmark 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 rose 10\/32 to 111 14\/32 to yield 10.14 % , while the treasury 's 12 % notes due 1995 rose 7\/32 to 103 5\/8 to yield 11.04 % . west german government bonds fell as much as 0.60 point in light , nervous trading . the 7 % treasury bond due
