if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : diversify . judging by a poll of wall street journal readers conducted this summer by erdos & morgan inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart . nearly 1,000 investors responded to the journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios . those portfolios are remarkably diversified . by spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate . for example , about 88 % of journal readers owned stock -lrb- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year -rrb- . but only 17.5 % said 0 they had more than half their money in the stock market . similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds . but only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives . the poll , conducted aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics . it found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . the response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . the results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 . nearly half of the respondents -lrb- 47 % -rrb- said 0 their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said 0 it was worth $ 1 million or more . the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago . for example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said 0 they expect a recession within 12 months . last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession . an additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months . only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth . apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much . a slim majority -lrb- 51 % -rrb- think 0 stock prices will be higher in august 1990 than they were in august 1989 . their verdict on real estate is almost the same . some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months . by contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold . since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe 0 inflation remains under control . even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance . nearly a third said 0 they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession . for the most part , the changes were `` slight . '' the two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -lrb- about 31 % -rrb- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -lrb- about 15 % -rrb- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -lrb- about 22 % -rrb- . a buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents . most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year . some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any . but the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark . about 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said 0 one is `` unlikely . '' those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll . and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual . about 60 % of them said 0 they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks . but as of august , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size . most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll . but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon . mr. dorfman covers investing issues from the wall street journal 's new york bureau .
