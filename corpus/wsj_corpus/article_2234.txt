just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves . does this signal 0 another black monday is coming ? or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ? here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do . joseph granville . `` i 'm the only one who said 0 there would be an october massacre , all through late august and september , '' says mr. granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer . `` everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . `` well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . if you 're a technician , you obey the signals . right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out . i see no major support until 2200 . i see a possibility of going to 2200 this month . '' mr. granville says 0 he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows friday . `` most people , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . '' elaine garzarelli . a quantitative analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. , ms. garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . friday 's big drop , she says 0 , `` was not a crash . this was an october massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . so she thinks 0 the damage will be short-lived and contained . `` those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she says . `` this is exactly the same thing , as far as i 'm concerned . '' thus , she says 0 , if the dow jones industrial average dropped below 2450 , `` it would just be a fluke . my advice is to buy . '' as she calculates it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . she says 0 that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' ned davis . friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says 0 mr. davis , president of ned davis research inc . but mr. davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says 0 he expects no 1987-style crash . `` there was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says . `` margin debt was at a record high . there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . the main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . `` a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . in 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect . today could even be an up day , mr. davis says 0 , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading . over the next several months , though , he says 0 things look bad . `` i think 0 the market will be heading down into november , '' he says . `` we will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . sort of a two-step bear market . '' he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around 2000 sometime next year . `` that would be a normal bear market , '' he says . `` i guess 0 that 's my forecast . '' leon g. cooperman . `` i do n't think 0 the market is going through another october '87 . i do n't think 0 that 's the case at all , '' says mr. cooperman , a partner at goldman , sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management . mr. cooperman sees this as a good time 0 to pick up bargains , but he does n't think 0 there 's any need to rush . `` i expect the market to open weaker monday , but then it should find some stability . '' he ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago . unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . and unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating . but the economy 's slower growth this year also means 0 the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says 0 . `` so it 's a very mixed bag . '' thus , he concludes 0 , `` this is not a good environment 0 to be fully invested '' in stocks . `` if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , i would not do any buying . but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio , so i would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` we 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' friday . john kenneth galbraith . `` this is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says mr. galbraith , an economist . `` i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . `` the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' nevertheless , he says 0 a depression does n't appear likely . `` there is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose 0 , '' he says . `` it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . '' mario gabelli . new york money manager mario gabelli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone . `` companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says . examples are `` ford looking at jaguar , bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting . '' these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so mr. gabelli figures 0 they will continue . `` the market was up 35 % since -lcb- president -rcb- bush took office , '' mr. gabelli says 0 , so a correction was to be expected . he thinks 0 another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says 0 he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during friday 's plunge . `` stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -lcb- this -rcb- week for guys like me , '' he says . jim rogers . `` it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says mr. rogers , a professor of finance at columbia university and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , quantum fund . he sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the u.s. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . `` friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' if the dollar stays weak , he says 0 , that will add to inflationary pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much . mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go . he recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . frank curzio . many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . queens newsletter writer francis x. curzio actually did it : he stated in writing in september 1987 that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . mr. curzio says 0 what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board . if it promptly cuts the discount rate 0 it charges on loans to banks , he says 0 , `` that could quiet things down . '' if not , `` we could go to 2200 very soon . '' frank w. terrizzi . stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says 0 mr. terrizzi , president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati . renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily u.s. treasury bills . `` t-bills probably are the right place 0 to be , '' he says .
