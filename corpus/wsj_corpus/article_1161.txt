the wall street journal `` american way of buying '' survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the journal by peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization . the two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples . the poll conducted by peter d. hart research associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from june 15 to june 30 , 1989 . the poll conducted by the roper organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from july 7 to july 15 , 1989 . responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with u.s. census data . for each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the u.s. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1\/2 percentage points in either direction . the margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger . in addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings . -lrb- see related story : `` the american way of buying : is buying a car a choice or a chore ? --
