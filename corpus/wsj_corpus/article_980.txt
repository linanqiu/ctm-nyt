italian car manufacturer fiat said 0 it is n't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with swedish auto and aerospace group saab-scania ab , which faces heavy losses in its car division . fiat said it 's only interested in technical cooperation with saab . `` we know that saab is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation , '' fiat said . `` but that partner is n't fiat . '' the italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with saab , but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy saab 's car division . fiat 's rejection of partnership with saab means that the swedish company , which announced last friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49 % , will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both ford motor corp. and fiat have turned down the offer . news reports said yesterday that saab is trying to start negotiations with french automakers peugeot and renault .
