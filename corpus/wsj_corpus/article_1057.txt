cray research inc. forecast that 1990 will be a no-growth year for its supercomputer line . in what has become a series of bad-news announcements , the world 's largest maker of supercomputers said that after reviewing its order prospects , `` we have concluded 0 it is prudent to plan for next year on the assumption 0 that revenue again will be flat . '' cray jolted the market in july when it slashed revenue and earnings projections for this year , citing a slowing economy that has delayed orders from government as well as commercial customers . the company made its 1990 projection -- an unusual event for cray -- in announcing improved net income for the third quarter . cray said 0 it earned $ 30.6 million , or $ 1.04 a share , up 35 % from $ 22.6 million , or 73 cents a share , a year ago . revenue gained 45 % to $ 210.2 million from $ 145.2 million . for the nine months , earnings totaled $ 36.6 million , or $ 1.24 a share , down 46 % from $ 68.1 million , or $ 2.19 a share , a year earlier . revenue was $ 454.6 million , a 6.9 % gain from $ 425.4 million . cray made its announcement after the stock market closed . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , cray closed down $ 1.125 at $ 34.25 . cray said 0 its order backlog at sept. 30 was $ 315 million , down $ 25 million from june 30 . marcello gumucio , president , said 0 the company `` did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned , and not quite as well in terms of signing orders . '' as for the current period , mr. gumucio said 0 , `` we anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters , but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter '' when cray earned $ 88.5 million , or $ 2.80 a share . he added that the company expects `` strong '' operating profit for the year , `` but at a level significantly lower than last year . '' he said 0 1989 's net income could be 11 % to 13 % of revenue , which , assuming current expectations , would be 40 % to 45 % below 1988 's level . last year , cray earned $ 156.6 million , or $ 4.99 a share , on revenue of $ 756.3 million . next year `` looks dismal , '' said 0 analyst paul luber of robert baird & co. , milwaukee . noting that cray does n't have a low-end supercomputer 0 to compete with the likes of convex computer corp. and international business machines corp. , mr. luber said 0 such a machine would be necessary `` to get things back on line here . '' cray has indicated 0 it will decide on whether to build such a machine before year end .
