the mouth is back . morton downey jr. , who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests , has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the consumer news and business channel , the cable channel partly owned by the general electric co. 's national broadcasting co . the premiere of `` showdown , '' with mr. downey and richard g. carter , a columnist with the new york daily news , is scheduled for dec. 4 at 8 p.m . cnbc is available to 13 million cable households . mr. downey said 0 he is not going to change his style , which some critics said 0 was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . `` but i 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . i 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home . but that does n't mean 0 i 'm not going to get angry . '' michael eskridge , president of cnbc , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` mort ! mort ! mort ! '' but just how does mr. downey 's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of cnbc 's business programming ? `` ninety percent of mort 's old show fits into our style , '' said mr. eskridge . `` that is consumer issues . '' mr. downey 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by mca inc. and produced by quantum media inc. , was canceled in july after advertisers and stations abandoned it .
