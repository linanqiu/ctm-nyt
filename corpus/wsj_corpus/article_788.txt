black & decker corp. said 0 it agreed to sell its bostik chemical adhesives unit to orkem s.a. , a french chemical company , for $ 345 million . bostik is the first emhart corp. unit 0 to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired emhart earlier this year . black & decker said 0 it plans to put other emhart units on the block in the future , with the goal of raising $ 1 billion in net proceeds . black & decker rescued emhart from the takeover bid of topper limited partnership last march by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $ 2.8 billion . the move significantly expanded black & decker 's product line , but also significantly increased its debt load . the acquisition boosted black & decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80 % . company officials have said 0 they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50 % over the next 2 1\/2 years . earlier this year , black & decker put three emhart businesses on the auction block : the information and electronics segment , the dynapert electrical assembly business and mallory capacitors . the three units had combined 1988 sales of about $ 904 million . the three units contributed about a third of emhart 's total sales . in addition , black & decker had said 0 it would sell two other undisclosed emhart operations if it received the right price . bostic is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five 0 to be sold . the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year . the five units generated sales of about $ 1.3 billion in 1988 , almost half of emhart 's $ 2.3 billion revenue . bostic posted 1988 sales of $ 255 million . `` our divestiture program is on schedule , and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ 1 billion in net proceeds , '' said nolan d. archibald , black & decker 's president and chief executive officer , in a statement . the sales are an attempt to quell investor concern about black & decker 's increased debt burden from the emhart purchase . the company 's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire emhart . the company maintains that it does n't expect emhart to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months . in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , black & decker closed at $ 19.75 yesterday , down 25 cents . the company did n't announce the sale until after the close of the market .
