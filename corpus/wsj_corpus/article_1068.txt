'' changes in cd yields in the week ended tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months . interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year . the average yield on small-denomination three-month cds moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85 % . long-term cds declined just a fraction . the average yield on both two-year cds and five-year cds was 7.98 % . only cds sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week , reflecting increased yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction . the average yield on six-month broker-sold cds rose to 8.29 % from 8.05 % and on one-year cds the average yield rose to 8.30 % from 8.09 % . the brokerage firms , which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose cds they sell , generally feel 0 they have to offer clients more than they can get on t-bills or from banks and thrifts directly . t-bills sold at monday 's auction yielded 7.90 % for six months and 7.77 % for three months , up from 7.82 % and 7.61 % , respectively , the week before . so-called jumbo cds , typically in denominations of $ 90,000 and up , also usually follow t-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors . some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields this week , both up and down . the average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00 % from 7.96 % , while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89 % . six-month and oneyear yields were unchanged , on average . `` the -lrb- cd -rrb- market is unsettled right now , '' said banxquote 's mr. mehl . `` it 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market . '' the small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks . some , however , lowered yields significantly . at chase manhattan bank in new york , for example , the yield on a small denomination six-month cd fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06 % . in california , bank of america dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year `` savings '' cds to 8.33 % from 8.61 % . yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96 % for $ 50,000 and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41 % for jumbo deposits .
