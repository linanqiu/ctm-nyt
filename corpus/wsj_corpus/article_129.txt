lewis c. veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful ford taurus and mercury sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems . most recently , mr. veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co . but he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's ford division to eclipse general motors corp. 's chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the u.s. . under the so-called team taurus approach , mr. veraldi and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle . the concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands . it was later applied to other new-car programs , including those that produced the ford thunderbird and mercury cougar . ford chairman donald e. petersen said yesterday that mr. veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of american-made cars . '' mr. veraldi worked at ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions .
