congress has been critical of the bush administration for not sending enough aid to poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a care package . last month , the senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to poland to assist its legislature , the sejm , in democratic procedures . senator pete domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . '' the poles might do better to view it as a trojan horse . it is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page , 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the united states . maybe after the staffers explain their work to the poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the american people .
