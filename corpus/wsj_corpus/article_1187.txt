disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of apple computer , intel and many other computer-related concerns . the drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0.7 % slide by the nasdaq composite index . it finished at 467.22 , down 3.45 . the nervousness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the dow jones industrial average , which slipped about 1 % . mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the nasdaq 100 index of the otc 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52 . the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32 . some traders said 0 the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors . but charlie howley , vice president in charge of otc trading at soundview financial in stamford , conn. , said 0 the selling was orderly . `` it 's a quiet retreat , '' said mr. howley . `` it 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off . '' some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said 0 . but some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues . yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million . for october so far , daily volume is averaging 150.3 million , putting it on track 0 to be the year 's busiest month . apple computer , which reported lackluster earnings friday , lost 1 1\/4 to 46 3\/4 on 1.1 million shares . stratus computer , which reported earnings late friday that were in line with a disappointing forecast , eased 3\/4 to 24 on 816,000 shares . investors apparently did n't like the news from rainbow technologies either . it said 0 net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter , compared with 16 cents a share a year earlier . rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 1\/4 . other technology stocks that were weaker included intel , which fell 1 1\/4 to 33 1\/2 on 1.9 million shares , mentor graphics , down 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 on 1.6 million shares , sun microsystems , which slipped 3\/8 to 18 1\/4 , and mci communications , down 1 to 42 3\/4 . microsoft , which last week rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , traders said , as it declined 2 1\/8 to 83 1\/8 . conner peripherals was unchanged at 15 . among takeover stocks , jefferson smurfit jumped 1 1\/4 to 42 1\/2 after sibv-ms holdings said 0 the price 0 to be paid to jefferson smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share . the increase of $ 1.25 a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to sibv-ms 's tender offer . sibv-ms holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of jefferson smurfit and a morgan stanley limited partnership . the jefferson smurfit affiliate , smurfit international b.v. , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding . these shares will be bought by sibv-ms holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares . another takeover target , lin broadcasting , eased 1\/2 to 110 1\/8 on 313,800 shares . lin 's suitor , mccaw cellular communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares . some analysts say 0 investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments . they say 0 investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % . that would be good news for the otc market , some analysts say 0 , because many small growth stocks are traded there . michael r. weisberg , partner in charge of research at robertson stephens & co. in san francisco , said 0 some investors have already made the switch . the robertson stephens index of 340 emerging growth stocks is up 23.1 % for the year through friday . the rise matches that of the dow jones industrials this year . `` it 's been a spectacular year for the emerging growth stock investor , '' mr. weisberg said . he predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum . he puts the otc market 's nellcor , office club and bizmart on the list . nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up 3\/4 to 16 7\/8 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue office club was unchanged at 10 3\/4 on 65,200 shares . bizmart , another retailing stock , was off 3\/8 to 8 1\/4 on nearly 80,000 shares . other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session . payco american , a credit collection concern , jumped 1 3\/8 to 20 5\/8 on volume of 93,000 , and mail boxes etc. , a private postal services company , advanced 1\/2 to 23 1\/2 on volume of 64,000 . but legent , a systems software stock , was down 1\/2 to 29 3\/4 on 39,300 shares . novell , a computer networking concern , fell 1 1\/2 to 30 on 152,000 shares . elsewhere , valley national continued its slide , dropping 2 1\/8 to 15 on 1.7 million shares . the arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state . higher earnings helped some issues . amgen rose 2 1\/4 to 54 3\/4 on almost 800,000 shares , and cvb financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares .
