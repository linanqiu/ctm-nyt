tandy corp. , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said 0 net income dropped 3.3 % for the first quarter ended sept. 30 . the results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders . tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375 a share to close at $ 44 in new york stock exchange composite trading . net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier . the company said 0 earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income . tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier . revenue rose 5 % to $ 986 million from $ 937 million . tandy said 0 consumer electronics sales at its radio shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products . `` radio shack continues to be lackluster , '' said dennis telzrow , analyst with eppler , guerin & turner in dallas . he said 0 tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its grid systems corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough 0 to offset the problems at radio shack . '' sales at radio shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said 0 . as a result , mr. telzrow said 0 he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 . tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a share , in the year ended june 30 . barry bryant , an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. , said 0 tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market . tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines . mr. bryant and other analysts hope 0 all those moves will combine to help tandy 's results improve in the important christmas quarter . `` they 've been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves 0 they 've made , '' he said . `` if the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
