the amendment , offered by rep. douglas bosco -lrb- d. , calif. -rrb- , was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the transportation department 's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines . the bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15 % or more of an airline 's stock if the purchase threatened safety , reduced the carrier 's ability to compete , or put the airline under foreign control . debate on the legislation , which faces a veto threat from president bush , is to continue today . the amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code . in 1983 , texas air 's continental airlines filed for bankruptcy . earlier this year , texas air 's eastern airlines filed for bankruptcy . `` this ought to be subtitled the ` do n't let frank lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said rep. james oberstar -lrb- d. , minn. -rrb- , chairman of the house aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals .
