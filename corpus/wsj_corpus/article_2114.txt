the sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered friday 's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout . the setback , in which treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking . `` it was a pretty wild day . our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said joel kazis , manager of trading at smith barney , harris upham & co . `` friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said . some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday . that caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities . but when stocks began to climb instead , prices of treasury bonds declined . contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . among the firms were merrill lynch & co. and dean witter reynolds inc . the bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the federal reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % . the closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3\/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % . the rate is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy . traders said 0 yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected . in fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week . others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing . the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3\/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . the reversal was even more evident among shorter-term treasury securities . after treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday . the bond-equivalent yield on three-month treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % friday . investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell . but prices of junk bonds , which were battered friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed . some traders said 0 the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying . in particular , they said 0 , firms such as first boston corp. and drexel burnham lambert inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . `` i think 0 the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said john lonski , an economist at moody 's investors service inc . u.s. treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in japan , which opened at about 7:30 p.m. edt . the benchmark 30-year bond , for example rose one point in early japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the tokyo stock market . but as japanese stocks rebounded , treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher . many u.s. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on japanese trading as an indication of where u.s. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the tokyo trading session . `` most of the action was during the night session , '' said michael moore , trading manager at continental bank . jay goldinger , who often trades overnight for capital insight inc. , beverly hills , calif. , said 0 trading in tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile . `` we went down 3\/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3\/4 point in 12 minutes , '' he said . in tokyo , trading is halted during lunchtime . tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for u.s. trading . when the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength . the bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on august u.s. merchandise trade and september industrial production . industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by dow jones capital markets report . the august trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in july . a widening of that magnitude , said 0 one new york trader , is `` not a favorable number ... . it could do damage to us .
