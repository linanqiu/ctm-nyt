friday 's volume on the first section was estimated at one billion shares , up from 862 million thursday . winners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged . with investors relieved at the overnight gain in new york stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe 0 the market was back to normal . the nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . `` investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at dai-ichi securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . the tokyo stock price index -lrb-

plunge in new york stocks , the nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall monday . but the nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with wall street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on oct. 13 . the tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the friday plunge and realized 0 these problems were unique to new york stocks and not directly related to tokyo . the nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week , adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing monday 's losses . but further major advances on the nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers . investors are still waiting to see how the u.s. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be

weakness in the british pound . the key financial times-stock exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 . the index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of wall street 's fall . london was weak throughout friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important u.k. trade figures for september . the ft-se 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed wall street lower . the ft 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0 . volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under thursday 's 387.4 million shares . dealers said 0 the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that wall street might open lower after its strong leap forward thursday . they added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of ft-se 100 shares . interest may remain limited into tomorrow 's u.k. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months . the key corporate news of the day was that british airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for ual corp. , the parent of united airlines . british airways rose initially after announcing its

close a penny per share lower at 197 pence . the airline was the most active ft-se 100 at 8.2 million shares traded . the next most active top-tier stock was b.a.t industries , the target of sir james
