the bush administration 's nomination of clarence thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the american bar association gave mr. thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . '' people familiar with the senate judiciary committee , which will vote on the nomination , said 0 some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the aba rating in hearings on the matter . mr. thomas , currently chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court . groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies . fourteen members of the house with jurisdiction over the eeoc have said 0 they oppose mr. thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -lcb- and -rcb- respect for the law . '' a senior justice department official , however , said 0 the administration is n't worried about the aba rating . `` we 're pleased 0 the aba rated him qualified , '' david runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview . the aba gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees 0 it believes 0 would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench . in contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy .
