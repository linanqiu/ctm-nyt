wham ! bam ! twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on-again , off-again ual buy-out slammed the stock market . now , stock prices seem to be in a general retreat . since peaking at 2791.41 on oct. 9 , the dow jones industrial average has lost 194.69 points , or 7 % , closing friday at 2596.72 , down 17.01 . the number of issues falling on the new york stock exchange each day is eclipsing the number of gainers . and the number of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new highs . but why should an iffy $ 6.79 billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market ? opinions vary about how important the ual deal was to the market 's health , but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the ual plan crumbled revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology . `` if this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact 0 it has had over the past two weeks , '' says dennis jarrett , a market strategist at kidder peabody . there are , of course , analysts who view the near-panic that briefly swept through investors on oct. 13 and again on oct. 24 as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market . sure , price action is volatile and that 's scary , but all-in-all stocks are still a good place 0 to be , they suggest 0 . the reaction to the ual debacle `` is mindless , '' says 0 john connolly , chief market strategist at dean witter . `` ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned . the only way 0 you can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just do n't make sense . '' he suggests , for example , that investors may have assumed that just because ual could n't get financing , no leveraged buy-outs can get financing . carried even further , some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing propping up stock prices , the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done . `` there will still be deals , '' argues mr. connolly . `` there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things 0 they 've done in the past , but deals wo n't disappear . '' he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls `` strategic deals , in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow , but because it 's a good fit . '' and even without deals , mr. connolly figures 0 the market would remain healthy . he notes , for instance , that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the 30 stocks in the dow jones industrial average since 1986 , yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high . `` those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up , '' he says . even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad , in mr. connolly 's view . for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully , the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes . `` who can make the better decision , the guy who has 10 seconds 0 to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world ? '' he says . `` what on earth does the ual deal have to do with the price of walmart , which i was able to buy on oct. 16 at a very attractive price ? '' kidder peabody 's mr. jarrett also sees some benefits to the stock market 's recent drop . `` we 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy , '' he says . `` the balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the ual deal -- we got a little pop . '' the pop sobered up investors who had been getting a little too ebullient , says 0 mr. jarrett . `` it provided an excuse 0 for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data , especially the third-quarter economic numbers , and to realize that we ca n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk bond market . '' but he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued , even with the economy obviously slowing . `` just because we 've got some realism back in the market does n't mean 0 it 's going lower from here , '' he says . `` the bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of sideways activity , especially after a 30 % gain in stock values over the past 12 months . '' he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation , the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs . maybe , maybe not . abby joseph cohen , a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert , is n't nearly so sanguine about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon . her view is that stock prices have three major props : merger and buy-out proposals , earnings and the economic outlook . at current levels of economic activity and earnings , stocks are fairly valued , she says 0 . but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business , and ual has obviously put a damper on that . `` stocks are n't cheap anymore , there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals , '' she says . `` i 'm not saying 0 they 've stopped altogether , but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high . '' but that 's not the only problem for stocks . the other two props -- earnings and the economic outlook -- are troubling , too . `` m&a is getting all the headlines right now , but these other things have been building up more gradually , '' she says . third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing , the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of 1990 is getting worse . `` there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices , '' she says . with all this , can stock prices hold their own ? `` the question is unanswerable at this point , '' she says . `` it depends on what happens . if the economy slips into a recession , then this is n't a level that 's going to hold . '' friday 's market activity stock prices tumbled for a third consecutive day as earnings disappointments , a sluggish economy and a fragile junk bond market continued to weigh on investors . the dow jones industrial average fell 17.01 points to 2596.72 in active trading . volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 170,330,000 shares . declining issues on the big board were far ahead of gainers , 1,108 to 416 . for the week the dow jones industrial average sank 92.42 points , or 3.4 % . oil stocks escaped the brunt of friday 's selling and several were able to post gains , including chevron , which rose 5\/8 to 66 3\/8 in big board composite trading of 2.4 million shares . the stock 's advance reflected ongoing speculation that pennzoil is accumulating a stake in the company , according to dow jones professional investor report . both companies declined to comment on the rumors , but several industry analysts told the professional investor report 0 they believed 0 it was plausible that pennzoil may be buying chevron shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company . usx gained 1\/2 to 33 3\/8 on a report in business week magazine that investor carl icahn is said to have raised his stake in the oil and steel company to just about 15 % . earlier this month , mr. icahn boosted his usx stake to 13.4 % . elsewhere in the oil sector , exxon rallied 7\/8 to 45 3\/4 ; amoco rose 1\/8 to 47 ; texaco was unchanged at 51 3\/4 , and atlantic richfield fell 1 5\/8 to 99 1\/2 . mobil , which said 0 it plans to cut its exploration and production work force by about 8 % in a restructuring , dropped 5\/8 to 56 1\/8 . the precious metals sector outgained other dow jones industry groups by a wide margin for the second consecutive session . hecla mining rose 5\/8 to 14 ; battle mountain gold climbed 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 ; homestake mining rose 1 1\/8 to 16 7\/8 ; lac minerals added 5\/8 to 11 ; placer dome went up 7\/8 to 16 3\/4 , and asa ltd. jumped 3 5\/8 to 49 5\/8 . gold mining stocks traded on the american stock exchange also showed strength . echo bay mines rose 5\/8 to 15 7\/8 ; pegasus gold advanced 1 1\/2 to 12 , and corona class a gained 1\/2 to 7 1\/2 . unisys dropped 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 after posting a third-quarter loss of $ 4.25 a share , including restructuring charges , but other important technology issues were mixed . compaq computer , which had lost 8 5\/8 thursday following a disappointing quarterly report , gained 5\/8 to 100 5\/8 . international business machines dropped 7\/8 to 99 7\/8 . digital equipment tacked on 1 1\/8 to 89 1\/8 , and hewlett-packard fell 3\/8 to 49 3\/8 . dividend-related trading swelled volume in merrill lynch , which closed unchanged at 28 3\/8 as 2.7 million shares changed hands . the stock has a 3.5 % dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today . erbamont advanced 1 1\/8 to 36 1\/2 on 1.9 million shares . montedison , which owns about 72 % of the company 's common stock , agreed to buy the rest for $ 37 a share . himont , another majority-owned unit of montedison , added 1 1\/4 to 47 1\/8 . milton roy jumped 2 to 18 3\/8 . crane said 0 it holds an 8.9 % stake in the company and may seek control . crane dropped 1 1\/8 to 21 1\/8 . comprehensive care , which terminated its agreement to merge with first hospital , dropped 7\/8 to 3 7\/8 . the company 's decision was made after first hospital failed to obtain financing for its offer .
