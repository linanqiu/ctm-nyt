amr corp. posted an 8.8 % drop in third-quarter net income and said 0 the fourth quarter will be `` disappointing '' as well , primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs . amr 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of american airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records . some analysts say 0 the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988 . still , amr 's stumble does n't bode well for the rest of the industry . the fort worth , texas , company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business , and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days . meanwhile , the company 's board , which had said nothing publicly about investor donald trump 's recently withdrawn $ 7.5 billion offer for amr , issued a statement condemning `` ill-conceived and reckless '' bids and saying 0 it was `` pleased '' that mr. trump had backed out . in the third quarter , amr said 0 , net fell to $ 137 million , or $ 2.16 a share , from $ 150.3 million , or $ 2.50 a share . revenue rose 17 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.33 billion a year earlier . amr 's chairman , robert l. crandall , said 0 the results were due to an 11 % year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield , an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold . `` we think 0 these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well , '' he said . tim pettee , an analyst with merrill lynch & co. , said : `` the business turned faster than expected . costs are giving them a little bit of trouble , and the whole industry is having a pricing problem . '' for the nine months , amr 's net rose 15 % to $ 415.9 million , or $ 6.59 a share , from $ 360.1 million , or $ 5.99 a share . revenue jumped 22 % to $ 7.89 billion from $ 6.46 billion . amr 's board , in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday , said : `` ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee , financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of amr shareholders ... . amr has not been , and is not , for sale . '' mr. crandall said 0 the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult 0 to weather . `` our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base , '' he said .
