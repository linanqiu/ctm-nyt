montedison s.p.a. definitively agreed to buy all of the publicly held shares of erbamont n.v. for $ 37 each . montedison now owns about 72 % of erbamont 's shares outstanding . the companies said 0 the accord was unanimously approved by a special committee of erbamont directors unaffiliated with montedison . under the pact , montedision will make a $ 37-a-share tender offer for erbamont stock outstanding . the tender offer will be followed by the sale of all of erbamont 's assets , subject to all of its liabilities , to montedison . erbamont will then be liquidated , with any remaining erbamont holders receiving a distribution of $ 37 a share . the companies said 0 the transaction is being structured this way because the laws of the netherlands antilles , under which erbamont is organized , do n't provide for merger transactions .
