the senate rejected a constitutional amendment that president bush sought to protect the u.s. flag from desecration . the 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the constitution . the vote , in which 11 gop lawmakers voted against mr. bush 's position , was a victory for democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the bill of rights . `` we can support the american flag without changing the american constitution , '' said senate majority leader george mitchell of maine . in order to defuse pressure for an amendment , mr. mitchell and house speaker thomas foley -lrb- d. , wash . -rrb- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change . mr. bush said 0 he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said 0 only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately . in june , the supreme court threw out the conviction of a texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying 0 he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the first amendment .
