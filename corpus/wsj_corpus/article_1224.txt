the bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker . early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble . such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the federal reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . for example , today the department of commerce is scheduled to release the september durable goods report . the consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by dow jones capital markets report is for a 1.2 % drop in september orders . that would follow a 3.9 % advance in august . bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower . the dow jones industrial average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . `` bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said joel marver , chief fixed-income analyst at technical data global markets group . `` when you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said 0 . the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1\/2 point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % friday . municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose . prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged . in more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by imo industries inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for beatrice co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers . in the treasury market , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news . `` on the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said william m. brachfeld , economist at daiwa securities america inc . `` on the other hand , we have economic news that is -lcb- expected to be -rcb- relatively positive for the bond market . we will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . today , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . tomorrow , resolution funding corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . so far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the refcorp bonds . analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . while some say 0 the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by ford motor credit corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . the division of auto maker ford motor co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . the company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by first boston corp . the issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company . first boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering . the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year treasurys . the only asset-backed deal larger than ford 's was a $ 4 billion offering by general motors acceptance corp. in 1986 . treasury securities treasury bonds were 1\/8 to 1\/2 point higher yesterday in light trading . the benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 3\/32 , compared with 101 17\/32 friday . the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . the latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % . short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale . the treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on oct. 10 . the $ 7.81 billion of six-month treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the oct. 10 auction . the rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively . here are auction details : rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . the percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . both issues are dated oct. 26 . the 13-week bills mature jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature april 26 , 1990 . corporate issues investment-grade corporates closed about 1\/4 point higher in quiet trading . in the junk bond market , imo industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % . peter karches , managing director at underwriter morgan stanley & co. , said 0 the issue was oversubscribed . `` it 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said . morgan stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal , $ 350 million of senior subordinated debentures by continental cablevision inc. , next tuesday . in light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors . in the case of beatrice , salomon brothers inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million portion of the offering . under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above treasurys . under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate 0 to maintain a market value of 101 . price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2 % . mortgage-backed securities activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . the federal national mortgage association offered $ 1.2 billion of remic securities in three issues , and the federal home loan mortgage corp. offered a $ 250 million remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities . part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts . traders said 0 thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks . in the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the treasury market . government national mortgage association 9 % securities for november delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 10\/32 , up 10\/32 ; and freddie mac 9 % securities were at 97 1\/2 , up 1\/4 . the ginnie mae 9 % issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the treasury 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points . municipals a $ 575 million san antonio , texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector . the refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . but alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off 1\/8 to up 3\/8 point . an official with lead underwriter first boston said 0 orders for the san antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' he attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . in addition , he noted 0 , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as hurricane hugo and the northern california earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds . a $ 137.6 million maryland stadium authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start . the issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with lead underwriter morgan stanley . activity quieted in the new york city bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point . foreign bonds japanese government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen . the turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about japan 's bond market . the benchmark no. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 95.39 , off 0.28 . the yield rose to 5.38 % . west german bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading . the benchmark 7 % bond due october 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 3\/4 % notes due july 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % . british government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as investors looked ahead to today 's british trade report . the benchmark 11 3\/4 % treasury bond due 2003\/2007 rose 1\/8 to 111 21\/32 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose 3\/32 to 103 23\/32 to yield 11.01 % .
