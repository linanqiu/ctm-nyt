oil imports to japan rose 12 % in september from year-earlier levels , according to statistics released by the government 's ministry of international trade and industry . the imports , totaling 98.5 million barrels , were 11 % lower than august levels . the year-on-year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products , and partly because of tax changes in 1988 that left oil companies with high inventories in the late-summer\/early-fall period . imports of crude from the middle east grew 17 % from year-earlier levels , and southeast asian crude imports grew 43 % . while mideast crude imports were higher compared with year-earlier levels , they fell 18 % compared with august imports . southeast asian crude imports , however , were 3.6 % higher than august .
