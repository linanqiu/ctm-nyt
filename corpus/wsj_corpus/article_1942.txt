'' overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . `` people were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a citicorp spokesman said 0 . but he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . ronald i. mandle , analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. , called citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ 93 million before taxes `` strong . '' a `` concerning '' item 0 the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses , which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business . citicorp 's spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth . wells fargo wells fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages . its margin fell only seven basis points , or 7\/100ths of a percentage point , from a year ago , compared with a 13-point drop at security pacific corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country . as a result , wells fargo 's net interest income rose $ 36.3 million , or 7 % , to $ 537 million for the quarter . non-interest income fell slightly to $ 191.9 million from $ 193.3 million , while wells fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense , which was almost flat at $ 393.4 million . the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave wells fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter , about 40 % higher than security pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the u.s. . wells fargo 's return on equity increased to 24.4 % from 23.8 % . wells fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to $ 806.8 million from $ 880.9 million . but the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans . that trend , and wells fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries 0 analysts have about wells fargo 's financial picture . wells fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to $ 711 million at sept. 30 from $ 664 million the previous quarter but was down from $ 852 million a year ago , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans . manufacturers hanover manufacturers hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a one-time $ 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , third-quarter earnings were $ 75 million . the comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . the bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . the net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain areas of wholesale banking . fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` we did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said . expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4 % , to $ 541 million . pnc financial pnc financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said 0 it continues to cut costs . net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4 % , to $ 317.7 million . trust income grew 15 % , to $ 49.9 million , while service charges , fees and commissions increased 22 % , to $ 79.4 million . the bank 's total allowance for credit losses was $ 502.1 million , or 1.82 % of total loans .
