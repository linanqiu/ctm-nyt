the nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed down 1.2 % . the effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers , who watched the nasdaq composite index tumble in sympathy with the dow jones industrial average , and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally . after plummeting 1.8 % at one point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 . in contrast , the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1 % . the new york stock exchange composite was 0.4 % lower for the day . as usual , the over-the-counter market 's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit . microsoft , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank as much as 4 ; but it finished at 80 7\/8 , down 2 1\/4 on volume of one million shares . mci communications , the most active issue , finished down 5\/8 to 42 1\/8 . mci traded as low as 41 3\/8 during the session . other active stocks included jaguar , whose american depositary receipts added 1\/8 to 11 1\/4 . apple computer improved 7\/8 to 47 5\/8 ; intel slipped 1\/4 to 33 1\/4 , and valley national corp. was up 1\/8 to 15 1\/8 . `` the market started with several strikes against it , '' said peter dapuzzo , head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of ual corp. continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating . but the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market , mr. dapuzzo said 0 . even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said 0 , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more than the big board . '' mr. dapuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors . while shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , mr. dapuzzo acknowledged 0 . the volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders , too . they do n't like the risks 0 they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically . market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will . in such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge losses . but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale . the market makers say 0 they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize 0 prices can tumble quickly . the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading . groused robert antolini , head of over-the-counter trading at donaldson , lufkin & jenrette : `` it 's making it tough for traders to make money . '' he said that when sell programs kick in , many traders believe that `` there 's no sense in sticking your nose out because you 're an instant loser .
