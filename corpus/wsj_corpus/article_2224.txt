population drain ends for midwestern states iowa is making a comeback . so are indiana , ohio and michigan . the population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new census bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . the gains , to be sure , are rather small . iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the census bureau says 0 . still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . between 1987 and 1988 , north dakota was the only state in the midwest 0 to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- illinois , kansas , minnesota , missouri , south dakota and wisconsin . the northeast has been holding its own in the population race . seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including new york , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again . at the same time , several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround . seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- west virginia , mississippi , louisiana , oklahoma , montana , wyoming and alaska . overall , though , the south and west still outpace the northeast and midwest , and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue . but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing . more elderly maintain their independence thanks to modern medicine , more couples are growing old together . and even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent . a new census bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 . this does n't mean 0 they 're less likely to live alone , however . that share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children . in 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970 . as people get even older , many become widowed . but even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives . only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 . the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % . more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially . careers count most for the well-to-do many affluent people place personal success and money above family . at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and yankelovich , clancy , shulman indicates . two-thirds of respondents said 0 they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said 0 they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . being successful in careers and spending the money 0 they make are top priorities for this group . unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich . average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 . the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the upper-middle class . although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income . across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive . despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it . twenty percent do n't even feel 0 they are financially well off . many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . about 40 % do n't feel 0 they 're more able than others . while twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year . thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles . odds and ends the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . the american bankers association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . the share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . per-capita personal income in the u.s. grew faster than inflation last year , according to the bureau of economic analysis . the amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 . per capita personal income ranged from $ 11,116 in mississippi to $ 23,059 in connecticut ... . there are 13.1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the national center for education statistics estimates 0 . about 54 % are women , and 44 % are part-time students .
