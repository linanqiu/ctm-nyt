business week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them . a four-page ad from texas instruments inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the oct. 20 `` corporate elite '' issue of the mcgraw-hill inc. publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages . readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human-sounding -- voice announce , `` i am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15-second discourse on its own attributes . the talking chip is n't cheap -- the per-ad cost to texas instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in business week 's charge -- but texas instruments believes 0 it is a first . previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services . and for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays .
