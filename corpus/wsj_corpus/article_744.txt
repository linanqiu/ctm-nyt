the justice department said 0 it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a pittsburgh suburb 's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped . this would be the department 's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the fair housing act . under those amendments , which took effect in march of this year , the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits . the ordinance , in moon township , prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility . in papers filed with the federal district court in pittsburgh , the justice department alleged that the ordinance , by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township , makes housing unavailable on account of handicap . the private suit was brought by three mentally retarded people who live in a group home in moon . greg smith , moon township manager , said 0 the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing `` the character and flavor of the neighborhood . '' he said 0 the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded . `` our intent is to spread them out '' to insure 0 they are well integrated into the community , he said 0 .
