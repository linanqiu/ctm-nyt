the bush administration , urging the supreme court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said 0 minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . solicitor general kenneth starr argued that the 1973 supreme court decision , roe vs. wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect . he also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents . the administration 's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases 0 the supreme court will hear argued and will decide this term . the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . the administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice william rehnquist last july when the high court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions . under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it . that is a much easier standard 0 for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion . on the provisions of the minnesota law , the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . the case , hodgson vs. minnesota , will be argued nov. 29 .
