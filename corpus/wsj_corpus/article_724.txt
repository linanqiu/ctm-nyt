the european community commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between france 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds . meeting in strasbourg wednesday , the commission voted , as expected , to formally object to the accord between air france , the state-owned airline , and state-controlled domestic carrier air inter . an ec spokesman said 0 the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with brussels on how to modify the pact . at issue is an accord dating back to march in which air france gained access to five domestic french routes under air inter 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of france under the flag of air france . the two shared results from this route swap , and followed rules on ticket pricing . the ec commission decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law . the airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections . an air france spokeswoman said , `` we 're absolutely ready to study all solutions . '' an air inter spokesman said , `` because they -lcb- the ec -rcb- have doubts , we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord .
