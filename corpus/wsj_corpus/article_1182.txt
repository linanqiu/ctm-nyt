mcdonald 's corp. said 0 third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement . the world 's largest fast-food chain said 0 net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a share , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago . in the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level . revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.46 billion . systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion . but sales for u.s. franchisees were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak 1988 figures . compared with the first nine months of last year , average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $ 3,200 , reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains . since mcdonald 's menu prices rose this year , the actual decline may have been more . mcdonald 's closed at $ 31.375 , up $ 1 , in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday . while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales , mcdonald 's company-operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months , with sales per company-operated unit rising $ 20,000 . one analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees , thus aiding promotional efforts . on average in the latest nine months , company-operated units in the u.s. had $ 90,552 more in sales than did franchised outlets . there are more than three times as many franchised domestic outlets as there are company stores . profit margins at u.s. company-owned stores in the quarter were up nearly 1 % , which the company attributed in part to lower food costs . prudential-bache securities analyst leslie steppel said 0 reduced labor costs helped boost margins , although she doubted `` 0 that kind of performance is sustainable . '' calling sales `` still relatively soft , '' ms. steppel believes that in real terms , u.s. sales slipped 3 1\/2 % to 4 % at company-operated stores in the quarter . apparently acknowledging weaker u.s. sales systemwide , mcdonald 's vowed `` to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand . '' overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago . third-quarter sales in europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings . mcdonald 's said that systemwide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange rates remained in effect . `` going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant analyst howard hansen of kidder , peabody & co . reflecting better growth prospects abroad , mcdonald 's noted that as of sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion . at the end of the third quarter mcdonald 's had 10,873 units operating world-wide . in the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a share , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier . revenue rose 11 % to $ 4.56 billion from $ 4.12 billion .
