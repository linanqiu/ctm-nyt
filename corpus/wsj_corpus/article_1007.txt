chicago - sears , roebuck & co. is struggling as it enters the critical christmas season . yesterday , the retailing and financial services giant reported a 16 % drop in third-quarter earnings to $ 257.5 million , or 75 cents a share , from a restated $ 305 million , or 80 cents a share , a year earlier . but the news was even worse for sears 's core u.s. retailing operation , the largest in the nation . sears said 0 its u.s. stores had a loss of $ 6.9 million , their first deficit for the period in more than five years . analysts estimated that sales at u.s. stores declined in the quarter , too . the results underscore sears 's difficulties in implementing the `` everyday low pricing '' strategy that it adopted in march as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business . under the new approach , sears set prices that were somewhere between its old `` regular '' and `` sale '' prices . the company said 0 it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers . sears officials insist 0 they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results . instead , a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on `` an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods , '' which account for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume . the new pricing strategy `` is working , '' the spokesman asserted 0 . he added that , after an initial surge triggered by an advertising blitz in march , sears expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue . sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise 0 it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls `` power formats . '' but analysts say 0 sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the christmas shopping season . `` i believe 0 everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work , '' says walter loeb of morgan stanley & co. , pointing to soft durable-goods sales . `` sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values . '' in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as sears had hoped , the giant retailer is now trying new ways 0 to drum up business without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy . the company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores , and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items . sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message . in a new tv ad , for instance , a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they are offering goods for `` 50 % , 60 % and 70 % off . '' by lowering prices throughout its stores , she says , `` sears has the right idea . '' but the ad also mentions sears 's sales -- a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing . `` when sears has a sale at a special price , '' the woman in the ad declares , `` it 's something 0 you do n't want to miss . '' recent surveys by leo j. shapiro & associates , a market research firm in chicago , suggest that sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise . the number of people who said 0 they were more likely to shop at sears fell in september to 37 % from 66 % in march , when sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy . moreover , the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to 16 % in september from 33 % in march . just 5 % of the respondents mentioned brands in september , up slightly from 2 % in march . only 2 % of the people in september cited sears 's `` friendly personnel . '' `` the power of price as an appeal , which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april , has diminished , '' says george rosenbaum , president of shapiro & associates . `` you see some improvement in these other areas , but it 's a very small and slow process . '' for the third quarter , sears said 0 its total revenue rose 4.8 % to $ 13.18 billion from $ 12.57 billion a year earlier . net income at sears 's merchandise group , which includes international and credit card operations , as well as u.s. stores , fell 25 % . profit at sears 's allstate insurance unit fell 38 % to $ 126.1 million because of hurricane hugo , which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company 's history . sears said 0 claims from the storm , as expected , reduced its third-quarter net by $ 80 million , or 23 cents a share . allstate is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the san francisco earthquake . but a spokesman said 0 the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on allstate as hurricane hugo did . net income at sears 's dean witter financials services group , meanwhile , rose nearly 32 % to $ 35.7 million , reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and discover credit card businesses . profit at sears 's coldwell banker real estate group nearly quadrupled to $ 81.2 million because of gains on sales of property . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , sears shares closed at $ 40.50 , up 87.5 cents .
