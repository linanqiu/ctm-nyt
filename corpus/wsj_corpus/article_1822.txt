the white house is making sure 0 nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly . in the aftermath of the california earthquake , president bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning . some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action . mr. bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon valdez oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane hugo struck the carolina coast , and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now . so the white house announced that mr. bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff john sununu . by noon , mr. bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle , who was in california ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from the federal emergency management agency ; and visited fema headquarters . mr. bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism . on his fema visit , mr. bush said that he hoped 0 there would be `` less carping '' about the emergency office 's performance this time , adding that the agency `` took a hit '' for its reaction to hurricane hugo . the white house already is talking of mr. bush visiting the california earthquake site this weekend . he visited the hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so .
