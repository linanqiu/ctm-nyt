directors of state-owned banca nazionale del lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution . until now , bnl 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a treasury decree . but under the bank 's proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members . the bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the treasury . bnl , which is controlled by the italian treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to iraq . the ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . in a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . bnl called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in december to vote on the proposals . bnl has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the milan stock exchange . the shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the atlanta scandal ; consob , the stock exchange regulatory body , reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension .
