a governing body of both the financial accounting standards board and the governmental accounting standards board voted to give the fasb jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities . the financial accounting foundation voted 12-2 that fasb accounting rules supercede gasb rules in regard to utilities , hospitals , and colleges and universities owned by the government . gasb rules still apply for other government units . after the gasb was founded in 1984 , 11 years after the fasb , the government-owned entities were supposed to follow fasb rules unless the gasb superceded them . the gasb had told governments 0 they did n't have to follow fasb rules on depreciation , making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools , which compete in the public bond market . the foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals , colleges and schools easier to compare with for-profit businesses . but it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under fasb rules and those still under gasb rules . `` managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial-report comparability with profit-making businesses is n't always as high a priority , '' a foundation spokesman said .
