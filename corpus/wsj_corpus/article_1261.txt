the national highway traffic safety administration said 0 it will start enforcing stiffer regulations jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles . the regulations , required under legislation enacted by congress last year , will apply to imports of vehicles that were n't built to meet u.s. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in europe or elsewhere abroad . u.s. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year , a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the u.s. each year . according to the nhtsa , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the u.s. government , or a person who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle that does n't meet the u.s. auto safety standards . the registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the u.s. safety standards , compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the u.s. standards . congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after u.s. auto dealers , including franchised foreign-car dealers , complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could n't meet u.s. auto safety standards .
