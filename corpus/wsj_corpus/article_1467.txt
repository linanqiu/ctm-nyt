a letter from senator john kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on manuel noriega . he correctly says 0 he has been down on noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup . our october 12 editorial should have been more precise . it meant to convey our hope that the senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of noriega to include other notorious central american drug runners . the sandinistas of nicaragua , for example , also are part of the castro-medellin cartel nexus . in his letter and on the basis of his losing vote tuesday against u.s. aid for the nicaraguan opposition , senator kerry makes clear 0 he has not made that intellectual leap . we were wrong .
