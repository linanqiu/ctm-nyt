rockwell international corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended sept. 30 . the aerospace , automotive supply , electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough . in an interview , donald beall , chairman , said 0 first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets . still , he added 0 , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million . for fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter , rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million , or 50 cents a share . that compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier . the prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the b-1b bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share . sales rose 4 % to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion . mr. beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment . overall , pretax electronics earnings soared 12 % to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million . all four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended sept. 30 . for the year , electronics emerged as rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings , muscling out aerospace for the first time . the graphics business , which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive , saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79 % to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million . for the year , bolstered by the introduction of the colorliner newspaper-printing press , graphics earnings almost doubled . aerospace earnings sagged 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year , largely due to lower b-1b program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in april 1988 . that was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines . the company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the c-130 gunship , according to analysts . for fiscal 1989 , the company posted net of $ 734.9 million , or $ 2.87 a share , down from $ 811.9 million , or $ 3.04 a share , in fiscal 1988 . excluding one-time additions to profit in each year , earnings per share were $ 2.47 , up 7.4 % from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988 . sales for the year rose 5 % to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988 .
