'' however , mr. moran added that the japanese generally have a positive view of the u.s. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline . he said , `` possibly , they 're waiting to buy at the -lrb- quarterly -rrb- refunding '' of government debt 0 to be held next month by the treasury . a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two-year notes . treasury , agency securities today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by resolution funding corp . the initial bond offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts , is n't expected to see robust demand . a small yield premium over comparable treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds . in when-issued trading , the refcorp bonds were quoted at a price 0 to yield 8.17 % . yesterday , the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 18\/32 0 to yield 7.89 % , compared with 102 9\/32 0 to yield 7.93 % on monday . the latest 10-year treasury was quoted at 100 22\/32 0 to yield 7.88 % , compared with 100 17\/32 0 to yield 7.9 % . short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower . the discount rate on three-month treasury bills was quoted at 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 % , while the rate on six-month treasury bills was quoted at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % . rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . corporate issues several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates . three of the largest offerings , by exxon capital corp. , xerox corp. and citicorp , were underwritten by groups led by salomon brothers inc . exxon capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $ 200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31 % . citicorp issued $ 200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82 % , and xerox priced $ 150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85 % . meanwhile , international business machines corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission for $ 800 million in new debt . this is in addition to ibm 's existing shelf registration under which $ 200 million in debt securities are available for issuance . in secondary trading , investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/8 to 1\/4 higher . municipals actively traded municipal bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2 point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply . new jersey turnpike authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 finished 1\/4 point stronger at 98 1\/2 bid , 0 to yield 7.32 % . traders said 0 municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in treasury issue prices . also , municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly , traders contended 0 . mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders said 0 . among the new issues was massachusetts 's $ 230 million of general obligation bonds . the bonds were won by a goldman , sachs & co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % . they were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20 % in 2009 . the massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter said 0 . mortgage - , asset-backed securities mortgage securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with government national mortgage association 8 % securities as the standout issue . the ginnie mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors . the derivative markets remained active as one new issue was priced and talk circulated about more offerings in the next day or two . the federal home loan mortgage corp. issued a $ 500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 8 1\/2 % securities . in the asset-backed market , a big offering of ford motor credit corp . auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand . the deal by the ford motor co. unit , priced monday , was increased to $ 3.05 billion from $ 2.58 billion . among major pass-through issues , ginnie mae 9 % securities for november delivery ended at 98 15\/32 , up 5\/32 , after touching an early high of 98 27\/32 ;
