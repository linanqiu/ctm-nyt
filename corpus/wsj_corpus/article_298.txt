du pont co. , hewlett-packard co. and los alamos national laboratory said 0 they signed a three-year , $ 11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research . the collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics , the companies said 0 . the materials , discovered during the past three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies . joint-research programs have proliferated as u.s. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia , especially in japan . the latest research pact bolsters du pont 's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors . the wilmington , del. , chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with oak ridge national laboratory and with argonne national laboratory . last year , du pont agreed to pay $ 4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the university of houston . hewlett-packard is a palo alto , calif. , computer maker . the los alamos laboratory is one of three u.s. department of energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs 0 to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace .
