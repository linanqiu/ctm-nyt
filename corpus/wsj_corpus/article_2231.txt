in response to your overly optimistic , outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts -lrb- people patterns , sept. 20 -rrb- : i am in the communications field , above entry level . i was laid off in august 1988 , and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in august 1989 . my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job ; i found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies . the statistics quoted by the `` new '' census bureau report -lrb- garnered from 1984 to 1986 -rrb- are out of date , certainly as an average for the northeast , and possibly for the rest of the country . i think 0 what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers 0 all is well -- if you 're getting laid off do n't worry , and if you 're unemployed , it 's a seller 's market . to top it off , you captioned the graph showing the average number of months in a job search as `` time off . '' are you kidding ? looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life -- and is for most people . your paper needs a serious reality check . reva levin cambridge , mass .
