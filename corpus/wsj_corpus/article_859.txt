regarding your sept. 28 politics & policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding iras : why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? the republicans maintain that a 30 % capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment , while the democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings . this is a classic example of the old saying , `` the whole is greater than the sum of its parts . '' it 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ 50,000 to pay the same 28 % incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ 250,000 . the 33 % bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the 5 % rate adjustment amount . it 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive . jeffrey t. schmidlin
