h&r block is one of the great success stories of u.s. business . oddly enough , this presents a problem for the stock . some money managers are disenchanted with h&r block because they suspect 0 the company 's glory days are past , or at least passing . block 's tax-preparation business is mature , they say 0 , and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition . it 's no secret that block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business . the street knows all about the predictability of its earnings , which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase . the company has consistently earned more than a 20 % annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15 % . but the tax-preparation business simply has no more room 0 to grow , says 0 mark cremonie , director of research for capital supervisors inc. , a chicago firm that manages $ 6.5 billion . `` you go to any medium-sized town in the u.s. and you 're going to see h&r block tax services . '' mr. cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8 % of h&r block . that was before the 1986 tax `` reform '' made taxes more complex than ever . `` one thing 0 you can bet on , '' he says , `` is that congress will do stupid things with the tax code . '' but capital supervisors sold the last of its h&r block holdings earlier this year . `` they 're thrashing around for diversification , '' he says . `` i think 0 a lot of their businesses are just so-so . '' last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the friday-the-13th minicrash . it closed yesterday at 34 3\/4 . to be sure , the stock still has a lot of fans . `` if you invested $ 10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962 , it would be worth well over $ 5 million today , '' says fredric e. russell , a tulsa , okla. , money manager . `` i do n't know what the risk is -lcb- of holding the stock -rcb- . taxes are not going out of business . '' many of his peers feel the same way . the number of big institutions that own h&r block shares is 207 and growing , according to a midyear tally by cda investment technologies . brokerage houses are sweet on h&r block , too . zacks investment research counts five brokerage houses that consider the stock a buy , and four that call it a hold . none dare say 0 to sell it . but some money managers are doing just that . eugene sit , president of sit investment associates in minneapolis , says , `` when we bought it , we thought 0 the growth rate was going to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds -lrb- the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for uncle sam 's check -rrb- . but neither of those developments did much 0 to juice up growth , mr. sit says 0 . he figures 0 block earnings are now growing at about a 10 % annual rate -lrb- down from about 14 % the past five years -rrb- and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . that 's `` not bad , '' mr. sit says 0 , but it sure does n't justify block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990 . he wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate ; as he figures it , h&r block does n't even come close . two other money managers , in explaining why they have sold large amounts of h&r block stock this year , spoke on the condition 0 they not be named . `` the stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so , '' said one . -lrb- in the past two years , the stock almost stalled out . it was above 33 , adjusted for a subsequent split , in 1987 , and has n't gotten much higher since . -rrb- `` there 's no more growth in the tax business -lcb- except -rcb- for increasing prices , '' the money manager added . the compuserve subsidiary -lrb- which provides information to home-computer users -rrb- is `` where the growth is , '' he said 0 , but its format is `` still too complicated . '' compuserve provides about 20 % of both sales and earnings . the tax business still provides about 70 % of earnings , on about 50 % of sales . personnel pool -lrb- temporary workers , mostly in the health-care area -rrb- chips in close to 25 % of sales but only about 9 % of earnings . the shortage of nurses is crimping profit at personnel pool , said 0 the second money manager . he concedes 0 h&r block is `` well-entrenched '' and `` a great company , '' but says `` it does n't grow fast enough for us . we 're looking for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable -lcb- price-earnings -rcb- multiple . '' thomas m. bloch , president and chief operating officer , says 0 `` i would disagree '' that the tax business is mature . for example , he says 0 , the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service , tested in parts of the country , aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry . mr. bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through . `` we 're still interested -lcb- in diversifying -rcb- , '' he says , `` but we 'd rather be prudent than make a mistake . '' he also says 0 compuserve 's earnings continue to grow `` 20 % to 30 % a year '' in spite of tough competition from giants like sears and ibm . and he says 0 block 's other businesses are growing , although less consistently . h&r block -lrb- nyse ; symbol:hrb -rrb- business : tax preparation year ended april 30 , 1989 : revenue : $ 899.6 million net loss : $ 100.2 million ; $ 1.90 a share first quarter , july 31 , 1989 : per-share earnings : loss of 8 cents vs. loss of 9 cents average daily trading volume : 145,954 shares
