intelogic trace inc. , san antonio , texas , said 0 it bought 2.7 million shares , or about 18 % , of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share , or $ 9.9 million . the move boosts intelogic chairman asher edelman 's stake to 20 % from 16.2 % and may help prevent martin ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern . mr. ackerman already is seeking to oust mr. edelman as chairman of datapoint corp. , an intelogic affiliate . the action followed by one day an intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives `` 0 to maximize shareholder value , '' including the possible sale of the company . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75 . mr. edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves , saying 0 they are meant only to benefit shareholders when `` the company is on a roll . '' he added , `` this has nothing 0 to do with marty ackerman and it is not designed , particularly , to take the company private . '' but mr. ackerman said 0 the buy-back , and the above-market price paid , prove that mr. edelman is running scared .
