bond prices staggered in seesaw trading , rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength . treasury bonds got off to a strong start , advancing modestly during overnight trading on foreign markets . `` we saw good buying in japan and excellent buying in london , '' said jay goldinger , market strategist and trader at capital insight inc. , beverly hills , calif . the market 's tempo was helped by the dollar 's resiliency , he said 0 . late in london , the dollar was quoted at 1.8410 west german marks and 142.70 japanese yen , up from late monday in new york . british sterling eased to $ 1.5775 from $ 1.5825 . when u.s. trading began , treasury bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single-family homes fell 14 % in september . the contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a 19 % drop in january 1982 . economists said 0 the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession , which would pave the way 0 for the federal reserve to lower interest rates . but later in the day , a report by the purchasing management association of chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario . the association said 0 its october index of economic activity rose to 51.6 % after having been below 50 % for three consecutive months . a reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding . bond prices fell after the chicago report was released . by the end of the day , bond prices were mixed . the benchmark 30-year bond was nearly 1\/4 point higher , or up about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . new two-year notes ended unchanged while three-year and four-year notes were slightly lower . municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1\/2 point higher while mortgage-backed securities were up about 1\/8 point . corporate bonds were unchanged . in the corporate market , an expected debt offering today by international business machines corp. generated considerable attention . the giant computer maker is slated to offer $ 500 million of 30-year non-callable debentures through underwriters led by salomon brothers inc . traders expect the bonds to yield about 0.60 to 0.65 percentage point above the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , which ended tuesday with a yield of about 7.90 % . the last time 0 ibm tapped the corporate debt market was in april 1988 , when it offered $ 500 million of debt securities . ibm 's visits to the debt market are closely watched by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts . some analysts believe 0 the company has the ability to pinpoint the trough in interest-rate cycles . in october 1979 , just days before the federal reserve raised interest rates , ibm offered $ 1 billion in debt securities . the boost in rates sent ibm 's bonds tumbling , leaving underwriters with millions of dollars of losses and triggering a sell-off in the overall market . the company `` ca n't be bullish if they 're doing a sizable 30-year bullet , '' said 0 one analyst . others said 0 ibm might increase the size of the offering to as much as $ 1 billion if investor demand is strong . the company has $ 1 billion in debt filed with the securities and exchange commission . `` i think 0 the $ 500 million is a little bit of a fire drill , '' said jim ednee , head of the industrial bond department at drexel burnham lambert inc . `` i think 0 as the pricing time arrives , the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount . '' treasury securities treasury prices ended mixed in light trading . the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 12\/32 to yield 7.90 % compared with 102 7\/32 0 to yield 7.92 % monday . the

bond issues were priced yesterday , including a scaled-backed offering by beatrice co . a spokesman for underwriters salomon brothers inc. said 0 beatrice cut its high-yield offering to $ 251 million

99.75 and carried a rate of 13 3\/4 % , while the $ 100 million of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced to float at 4.25 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate , or libor . the one-year libor rate yesterday was 8 7\/16 % . since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market , at least two other junk issuers have said 0 they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings , and several issues have been postponed . william carmichael , beatrice chief financial officer , said 0 favorable market conditions in september prompted the company to plan more debt than necessary . `` however , given the changes in the market conditions that have occurred since then , we decided to sell only the amount needed to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization , '' he said . under the firm 's original bank credit agreement , it was required to raise $ 250 million of subordinated debt 0 to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem $ 526.3 million of increasing rate debentures in august . a month ago , when beatrice first filed to sell debt , the company had planned to offer $ 200 million of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3\/4 % . the $ 150 million in senior subordinated floating-rate notes were targeted to be offered at a price to float four percentage points above the three-month libor .

stricter convenants . continental cablevision inc. , via underwriters at morgan stanley & co. , priced $ 350 million of junk bonds at par to yield 12 7\/8 % . mortgage-backed securities j.c. penney & co. issued $ 350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables . the securities were priced at 99.1875 to yield about 9.19 % . underwriters at first boston corp. said 0 the j.c. penney

is backed by freddie mac 's 10 % issue with a weighted average term to maturity of 29.583 months . municipal issues municipal bonds were little changed to 1\/2 point higher in late dealings . `` we were oversold and today we bounced back . some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary -lcb- market -rcb- , which we have n't seen for a while , '' said one trader . `` there were no -lcb- sell -rcb- lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit . there 's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals , '' he said , adding that he expects prices to `` inch up '' in the near term . the market 's tone improved after monday 's pricing of $ 813 million new york city general obligation bonds . the issue 's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions , traders said 0 . demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit underwriters to trim some yields in the tax-exempt portion of the offering late monday . a two-part $ 75.1 million offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the new jersey wastewater treatment trust was more than half sold by late in the session , according to lead underwriter merrill lynch capital markets . the debt was reoffered priced to yield from 6 % in 1991 to 7.15 % in 2008-2009 . foreign bonds most foreign government bonds markets were quiet . west german bonds firmed a bit after monday 's fall , but traders said 0 the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again . in a speech given friday but released late monday , bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming german economy has reached the peak of its cycle . his comments were interpreted as a sign that higher interest rates are possible . on oct. 5 , the bundesbank raised the lombard and discount rates by one percentage point to 8 % and 6 % , respectively , the highest levels in seven years . germany 's 7 % bond due october 1999 was unchanged at 99.35
