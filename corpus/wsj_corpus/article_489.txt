john lehman 's editorial-page article on the pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population -lrb- `` in the pentagon , the undead walk , '' oct. 18 -rrb- . the media 's treatment of the defense department during the vietnam war , the carter administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of lt. col. oliver north have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there . the resulting haunted house tends to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be able to win if called on . perhaps the halloween season is a good time for congress to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment . mike greece former air force career officer new york where does mr. lehman get off castigating gen. george marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives ? ever since the days of alfred thayer mahan -lrb- u.s. naval officer and naval historian -rrb- and teddy roosevelt the navy has been the service most favored by washington officialdom . mr. lehman overlooks the fact that the navy possesses its own air force -lrb- the carrier fleet -rrb- and its own army -lrb- the marines -rrb- , which in turn has its own air force . of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but mr. lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer . l.h. blum beaumont , texas i agree with mr. lehman 100 % ! is n't this the same guy who resigned as navy secretary because he could n't get his 1,000-ship navy ? i personally do not want to hasten mr. lehman 's demise , but i can see him figuring prominently in his own article . carl banerian jr . birmingham , mich .
