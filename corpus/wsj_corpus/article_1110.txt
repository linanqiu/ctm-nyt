the stock market went on a dizzying ride as ual , parent of united airlines , once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback . at the end of it all , the dow jones industrial average closed down 3.69 to 2659.22 . at one point yesterday morning , the dow was down 80.53 points . new york stock exchange volume was 237,960,000 shares . declining issues swamped advancers , 1,222 to 382 . yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190-point plunge on friday the 13th , the stock market still has a bad case of nerves . takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges . and there is more volatility to come . `` october 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve , '' said jack solomon , technical analyst for bear stearns . `` people are fearful and sensitive . everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the button . i have never had as many calls as i had this morning . volatility is here to stay . '' the dow jones industrial average plunged about 80 points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell . for many , it began to look like a replay of oct. 13 . as stocks and stock-index futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the s&p 500 stock futures pit . under a post-1987 crash reform , the chicago mercantile exchange would n't permit the december s&p futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour . that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big board . but at a critical moment , stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control . they scooped up hundreds of s&p futures when the market needed it most . at about 10:40 a.m. edt , several big buy orders hit the s&p pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks . `` it is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected , '' said one chicago-based futures trader . `` these guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are . '' traders said 0 goldman sachs , shearson lehman hutton and salomon brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment . shearson lehman hutton declined to comment . officials at goldman sachs and salomon brothers were unavailable for comment . as in the oct. 13 massacre , yesterday morning 's drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in ual . a ual statement after the market closed monday indicated that the airline 's board wanted to keep the company independent , effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out . five minutes before the big board opened , a preliminary price was flashed for ual -- somewhere between 135 and 155 , a loss of as much as $ 43 a share from monday 's close . ual finally opened for trading at 10:08 a.m. at 150 , down $ 28 . floor traders said 0 there was a huge crowd around the big board specialist 's post where ual trades . `` there was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he added . takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ 700 million on ual -- started selling other stocks as well as s&p futures in an attempt to hedge against a further ual blood bath . shortly after the ual opening , program traders started selling stocks in the major market index and s&p 500 index . the 20-stock mmi mimics the dow jones industrial average . by 10:30 a.m. the dow was down 62.70 . all 20-stocks in the mmi except exxon , general motors and sears were down $ 1 to $ 2 . at 10:33 , when the s&p 500 december futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs , s&p futures trading was halted and program trades on the big board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances . under the rules adopted by the chicago mercantile exchange , the futures contract can not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase futures . at this point , the dow industrials were down 75.41 points and falling . the trading halt in the s&p 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many traders maintain 0 . but as the fright began to spread through the s&p pit , the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively . `` it was whooosh ! '' said one futures trader . in five minutes , the dow industrials climbed almost 30 points . the big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the dow 's loss to 31 points by 11 a.m . traders said 0 the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders . these firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the s&p futures hit the trading limit . then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures , which abruptly halted the stock market 's decline as traders began to buy stocks . from then on , the dow industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points . then , in late-afternoon trading , hundred-thousand-share buy orders for ual hit the market , including a 200,000-share order through bear stearns that seemed to spark ual 's late price surge . almost simultaneously , painewebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks . the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain , before closing at a slight loss . some institutional traders loved the wild ride . `` this is fun , '' asserted susan del signore , head equity trader at travelers investment management co . she said 0 she used the market 's wild swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell-off . on the comeback , ms. del signore unloaded shares 0 she has been aiming to get rid of . but traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken . `` this market is eating away my youth , '' said chung lew , head equity trader at kleinwort benson north america inc . `` credibility sounds intangible . but i think 0 we are losing credibility because when the market does this , it does n't present itself as a rational investment . but if you overlook all this , it is a beautiful market for investment still . '' traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a japanese buy program that painewebber carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy , according to dow jones professional investor report . dow jones climbed 5 3\/4 to 41 on very heavy volume of 786,100 shares . analysts said 0 a big japanese buy order was behind the rise . a dow jones spokesman said 0 there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity . other issues said to be included in the buy program were procter & gamble , which rose 2 7\/8 to 133 1\/2 ; atlantic richfield , which gained 2 to 103 3\/4 , and rockwell international , which jumped 2 3\/4 to 27 1\/8 . painewebber declined to comment . ual finished at 170 , off 8 3\/8 . other airline stocks fell in response to the ual board 's decision to remain independent for now , including usair group , which separately reported a third-quarter loss of $ 1.86 a share compared with a year-ago profit . usair fell 2 1\/2 to 40 . amr , the parent of american airlines , fell 1 3\/4 to 68 7\/8 on 2.3 million shares ; delta air lines lost 1 1\/2 to 66 , southwest airlines slid 3\/4 to 24 1\/4 and midway airlines dropped 1\/4 to 14 7\/8 . texas air , which owns continental and eastern airlines , lost 3\/8 to 13 1\/8 on the american stock exchange . metals stocks also were especially weak , as concerns about the earnings outlook for cyclical companies weighed on the group . aluminum co. of america dropped 1 1\/2 to 70 1\/4 , phelps dodge fell 4 to 59 7\/8 , asarco lost 1 3\/8 to 31 3\/4 , reynolds metals slid 1 3\/8 to 50 3\/8 , amax dropped 1 1\/8 to 21 5\/8 and cyprus minerals skidded 2 to 26 3\/4 . alcan aluminium was an exception , as it gained 1 3\/8 to 23 on two million shares . goodyear tire & rubber tumbled 2 7\/8 to 43 7\/8 . its third-quarter earnings were higher than a year ago , but fell short of expectations . other stocks in the dow industrials that failed to benefit from the market 's rebound included united technologies , which dropped 1 to 53 5\/8 , and bethle hem steel , which fell 1 to 16 7\/8 . bankamerica dropped 1 1\/4 to 29 1\/2 on 2.3 million shares amid rumors that the earthquake last week in the san francisco area had caused structural damage to its headquarters building . the company denied the rumors and noted that it does n't own the building . stocks of california-based thrifts also were hard hit . great western financial lost 1 1\/8 to 20 1\/2 on 1.6 million shares , golden west financial dropped 1 1\/4 to 28 1\/2 and h.f. ahmanson dipped 5\/8 to 21 1\/4 . homefed plunged 3 5\/8 to 38 1\/2 ; its third-quarter earnings were down from a year ago . golden valley microwave foods skidded 3 5\/8 to 31 3\/4 after warning that its fourth-quarter results could be hurt by `` some fairly large international marketing expenses .
