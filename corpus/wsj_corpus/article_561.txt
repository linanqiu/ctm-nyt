despite politicians ' hand-wringing about the federal budget , the government ended fiscal 1989 with a $ 152.08 billion deficit , about the same as the two previous years . even white house budget director richard darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report . `` i suppose 0 you could say 0 the good news is that the deficits are not heading up , '' he said , `` but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not . '' the federal deficit was $ 155.15 billion in 1988 and $ 149.69 billion in 1987 . the 1989 deficit would have been nearly $ 10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on sept. 30 . because the resolution trust corp . could n't spend the money fast enough , the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990 . nevertheless , the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $ 136 billion target set by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law by $ 16 billion , a reminder of that law 's shortcomings . the law sets a deficit target of $ 100 billion for fiscal 1990 . a partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt , triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the gramm-rudman law . the white house and the democratic leadership in congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year . neither side showed any sign of retreating . meeting with reporters friday , mr. darman again said 0 he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the house , which would increase spending in future years . underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years , the treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt -- $ 240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on social security , the single largest government program . in all , federal outlays amounted to $ 1.143 trillion in 1989 , up 7.5 % from the previous year , the treasury said 0 . federal revenues rose 9 % to $ 990.79 billion . the treasury said 0 a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared . the treasury marked up its forecast by $ 17 million in july , but that proved to be about $ 5 billion too optimistic . the government ran a deficit of $ 6.16 billion in september , compared with a surplus of $ 10.17 billion in september 1988 . outlays for the month totaled $ 105.39 billion , up from $ 87.57 billion a year earlier . the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and social security checks normally issued in october that were issued in september this year because oct. 1 fell on a sunday . revenues were $ 99.23 billion , up from $ 97.74 billion a year earlier .
