lin broadcasting corp. said 0 it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for clarification of the offer . the new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million lin shares . mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin . lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their cellular-telephone businesses . bellsouth has notified lin that it would `` shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted . '' the lin board said 0 holders may be misled by the provision in the mccaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares . mccaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the lin board said 0 . the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate lin in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years . '' in national over-the-counter trading , lin closed at $ 104.75 , down $ 2.75 .
