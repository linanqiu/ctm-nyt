two leading constitutional-law experts said 0 president bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto . professors philip kurland of the university of chicago and laurence tribe of harvard law school said 0 any effort by president bush 0 to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents . a line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure . mr. bush has said 0 he would like to be able to use this procedure . a white house spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case . but the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy -lrb- d. , mass. -rrb- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- mr. kurland is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal . the two professors said 0 the constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . moreover , they said 0 the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the civil war , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation 0 to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
