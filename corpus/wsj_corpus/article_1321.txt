qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate , qintex entertainment inc. , filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code . qintex entertainment also said 0 david evans , its president and chief executive , and roger kimmel , a director , both resigned . neither could be reached for comment . earlier this month , qintex australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit 0 the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction . mr. evans had been the de facto head of mgm\/ua for months . qintex entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` lonesome dove , '' said 0 it filed for chapter 11 protection after qintex australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of `` the new leave it to beaver show . '' qintex entertainment is 43 % owned by qintex australia and said 0 it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements . after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , qintex entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares . the stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer . jonathan lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of qintex entertainment , said 0 qintex entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with mca . the $ 5.9 million payment was due oct. 1 and the deadline for default was oct. 19 . mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements . mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` the new leave it to beaver '' as well as other mca properties . qintex australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation . they continued to represent that to the board , '' said mr. lloyd . `` we were reassured 0 they would stand behind the company . '' mr. lloyd said 0 both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on oct. 14 . at that point , he said 0 , qintex australia stated 0 it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . however a qintex australia spokesman said 0 his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . in a prepared statement from australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the mgm talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter 11 filing . he said 0 the company believed 0 qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means . the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors . `` it 's a shocker , '' said 0 joseph di lillo , chairman of drake capital securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment . qintex australia was `` going to pay more than $ 1 billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million . '' qintex said 0 mr. evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that mr. kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary . mr. kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 . the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be revived . it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested . however , `` we are n't currently doing anything . it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said barry diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp .
