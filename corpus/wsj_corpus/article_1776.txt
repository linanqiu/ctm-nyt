bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply . early yesterday , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive california earthquake . for example , some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies , which face massive damage claims , would get hit hard . but when the dow jones industrial average rose instead , bonds drifted lower . with stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said 0 brian j. fabbri , chief economist at midland montagu securities inc . `` if the stock market tremors are behind us , then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest rates are heading . the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 point , or about $ 3.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little changed . interest rates barely budged from tuesday 's levels . most junk bonds , which have been battered in recent weeks , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher . but some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash . rjr holdings capital corp. 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point . other rjr issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 1\/2 point . in the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds , continental airlines said 0 it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering . continental , a unit of texas air corp. , slashed the size of its note offering from $ 150 million to $ 71 million . the move had been widely expected . in the multipart offering , the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes . a continental spokeswoman said 0 the notes may be offered at a later date . `` this was not a do-or-die deal , '' she said . `` i think 0 this is a market that required some level of security . it did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market . '' investors have been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability to place the $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end . supply troubles were also on the minds of treasury investors yesterday , who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week . `` we 're being bombarded by new treasury and agency debt offerings , '' said william sullivan jr. , director of money-market research at dean witter reynolds inc . `` the market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels . '' in addition to the $ 15.6 billion of treasury bills 0 to be sold at next week 's regular monday auction , the government will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year treasury notes . and resolution funding corp. said late yesterday that it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds wednesday . refcorp is the financing unit of resolution trust corp. , a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts . its securities have been dubbed `` bailout bonds '' by traders . in when-issued trading , the two-year treasurys had a yield of about 7.88 % . in the municipal market , all eyes were on california debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of tuesday 's earthquake . but traders said 0 the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of california state and local municipal debt . `` there are certain bonds 0 traders refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the -lrb- issuers -rrb- are on top of the san andreas fault , '' said zane mann , editor of the california municipal bond advisor , a newsletter for investors . since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected . but some bond market analysts said 0 that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash 0 to pay damage claims . `` insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct san francisco , '' said charles lieberman , chief economist at manufacturers hanover securities corp . he also expects the performance of municipals to lag treasurys as california is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities . a report issued late yesterday by standard & poor 's corp. concluded 0 the quake wo n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of northern california affected by the quake . treasury securities treasury bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading . the benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 0 to yield 8.03 % , compared with 100 28\/32 0 to yield 8.04 % tuesday . the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 0 to yield 8 % , compared with 99 25\/32 0 to yield 8.01 % . short-term rates were little changed . corporate issues investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 point lower . the continental junk bond offering , underwritten by drexel burnham lambert inc. , was the only new issue priced yesterday . in the four-part offering , the $ 71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 % . municipals municipal bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point lower , hurt by the circulation of two `` bid-wanted '' lists totaling $ 655 million . chemical securities inc. is acting as agent for the seller . meanwhile , some california issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but traders said 0 there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake . but new york city general obligation bonds came under selling pressure . traders said 0 a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday , pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point . traders said 0 investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the nov. 7 election . washington , d.c. , topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $ 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes . in late trading , new jersey turnpike authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 1\/4 point at 98 bid . the yield was 7.35 % , up 0.01 percentage point . mortgage-backed securities mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings . there was no appreciable market impact from the california earthquake . dealers said 0 there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake-related claims , but no selling materialized . the federal home loan mortgage corp. and federal national mortgage association , two dominant issuers of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of california home loans in their mortgagebacked pools . but their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans 0 they purchase . and because northern california home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large 0 to be included in freddie mac and fannie mae pools . meanwhile , government national mortgage association 9 % securities for november delivery ended at 97 29\/32 , unchanged . freddie mac 9 % securities were at 97 4\/32 , down 1\/32 . in derivative markets , fannie mae issued two $ 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities . foreign bonds british government bonds , or gilts , ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from tuesday 's drop . the treasury 's 11 3\/4 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 31\/32 to yield 10.08 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 22\/32 to yield 11.04 % . traders said 0 today may be an anxious day for the market . several key economic figures are due out and chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson is scheduled to give the annual `` mansion house '' address to the financial community . the chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes . economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address , given mr. lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently . meanwhile , japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency . japan 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 0 to yield 5.315 % . in west germany , investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction . the government 's 7 % issue due october 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 to
