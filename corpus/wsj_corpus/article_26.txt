the white house said 0 president bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in `` significant quantities '' in the u.s. , the virgin islands and other u.s. possessions . the action came in response to a petition filed by timex inc. for changes in the u.s. generalized system of preferences for imports from developing nations . previously , watch imports were denied such duty-free treatment . timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different u.s. tariff classifications . the white house said 0 mr. bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the u.s. and the virgin islands . '' timex is a major u.s. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the philippines and other developing nations covered by the u.s. tariff preferences . u.s. trade officials said 0 the philippines and thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action . imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in u.s. watch imports that year , according to an aide to u.s. trade representative carla hills .
