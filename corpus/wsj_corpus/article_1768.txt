two years of coddling , down the drain . that 's the way 0 a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash . ever since that fearful black monday , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that oct. 19 , 1987 , was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place 0 for average americans to put their hard-earned dollars . and until last friday , it seemed 0 those efforts were starting to pay off . `` some of those folks were coming back , '' says leslie quick jr. , chairman , of discount brokers quick & reilly group inc . `` we had heard from people who had n't been active '' for a long time . then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock-market volatility . all of a sudden , it was back to square one . `` it 's going to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , '' says jeffrey b. lane , president of shearson lehman hutton inc . `` i think 0 it will shake confidence one more time , and a lot of this business is based on client confidence . '' brokers around the country say 0 the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie . customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way 0 they did in post-crash 1987 . `` the kinds of questions 0 you had before have resurfaced , '' says raymond a. `` chip '' mason , chairman of regional brokerage firm legg mason inc. , baltimore . `` i can just tell 0 the questions are right back where they were : ` what 's going on ? , ' ` ca n't anything be done about program trading ? , ' ` does n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` where is the sec on this ? ' '' mr. mason says 0 he 's convinced 0 the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe 0 the deck is stacked against them . but `` these wide swings scare them to death . '' all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as shearson and merrill lynch & co. that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , businesses . after expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash , retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead . true , the amount of money 0 investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately . but those dollars have been going into such `` safe '' products as money market funds , which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms . at discount brokerage charles schwab & co. , such `` cash-equivalent '' investments recently accounted for a record $ 8 billion of the firm 's $ 25 billion of client 's assets . the brokers ' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market . and before last friday , they were actually making modest progress . a slightly higher percentage of new york stock exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 , according to securities industry association data . in 1987 , an average 19.7 % of big board volume was retail business , with the monthly level never more than 21.4 % . the retail participation dropped to an average 18.2 % in 1988 , and shriveled to barely 14 % some months during the year . yet in 1989 , retail participation has been more than 20 % in every month , and was 23.5 % in august , the latest month for which figures are available . jeffrey schaefer , the sia 's research director , says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in big board data . but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup . but `` friday did n't help things , '' says 0 mr. schaefer . with the gyrations of recent days , says 0 hugo quackenbush , senior vice president at charles schwab , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . '' joseph grano , president of retail sales and marketing at painewebber group inc. , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market . investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he says 0 . friday 's plunge , he is telling painewebber brokers 0 , was nothing more than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks . '' meanwhile , painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money . `` it 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets , rather than push the investor to move into -lrb- specific -rrb- products such as equities , '' mr. grano says . `` the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . '' it could be a long wait , say 0 some industry observers . `` some investors will tiptoe back in , '' says richard ross , a market research director for elrick & lavidge in chicago . `` then there 'll be another swing . given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , '' he adds . mr. ross , who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said 0 a market plunge like friday 's `` shatters investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market . '' the long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' mr. ross declares 0 .
