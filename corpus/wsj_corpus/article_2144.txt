whirlpool corp. , benton harbor , mich. , said 0 it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or cfcs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers . the maker of home appliances said 0 the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs 0 to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring . earlier repairs vented the cfcs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere . cfcs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants . but their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance . whirpool said , `` we see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of cfc use in appliance manufacture .
