reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered . `` we could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said robert king , senior vice president of otc trading at robinson-humphrey co. in atlanta . `` it was -lcb- like -rcb- the friday before black monday '' two years ago . whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges . nonetheless , the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 . ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . by comparison , the new york stock exchange composite tumbled 5.8 % friday and the american stock exchange composite fell 4 % . on oct. 16 , 1987 , the nasdaq composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11 % slide , three days later . nasdaq volume friday totaled 167.7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year . the single-day record of 288 million shares was set on oct. 21 , `` there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said e.e. `` buzzy '' geduld , president of herzog , heine , geduld , a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues . most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . mr. king of robinson-humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe 0 the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades . the subject is a sore one for nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . peter dapuzzo , head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton , declared : 0 `` it was the last hour of trading on a friday . there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots . it was n't intentional , we were all busy . '' james tarantino , head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san francisco , said , 0 `` it was just like two years ago . everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . '' jeremiah mullins , the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york , said proudly that his company executed every order 0 it received by the close of trading . but , he added 0 , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . on days like friday , that means 0 they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . when selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in otc stock prices . on friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said 0 . but , with profits sagging on wall street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . mr. tarantino of hambrecht & quist said 0 some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . `` everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said . so , while otc companies incurred losses on friday , trading officials said 0 the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . `` two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said mr. king of robinson-humphrey . tony cecin , head of equity trading at piper , jaffray & hopwood in minneapolis , said that piper jaffray actually made money on friday . it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said 0 . joseph hardiman , president of the national association of securities dealers , which oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . '' `` the pace of trading was orderly , '' he said . nasdaq 's small order execution system `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to mr. hardiman . nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence . in the past , the otc market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation . because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and otc market officials hope 0 the damage wo n't be permanent . but they are worried . `` we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented mr. mullins of dean witter . more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support 0 the otc market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october 1987 crash . mr. cecin of piper jaffray says 0 some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears . it wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says 0 . the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers . but grateful traders said 0 the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago . shearson 's mr. dapuzzo said 0 retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to bargain-hunt . institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer . `` we had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' mr. dapuzzo said . `` if they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' in addition , he said 0 , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down . in addition , mr. dapuzzo said 0 computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of 2000 small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market . nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered . the nasdaq 100 index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big otc technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 . the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98 . the otc market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks . but they fell sharply . mccaw cellular communications , for instance , has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metromedia 's new york city cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular . mccaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . lin broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 . the turnover in both issues was roughly normal . on a day when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with investors , commercial intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said 0 haas & partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company . commercial intertech plummeted 6 to 26 . the issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled friday . on the otc market , first executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 . among other otc issues , intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; laidlaw transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the american depositary receipts of jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; mci communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; apple computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and nike dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 .
