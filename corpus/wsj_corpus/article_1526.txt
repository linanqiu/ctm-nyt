bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt . but while the overall market improved , the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk-bond prices rose . yesterday , prudential-bache securities inc. said 0 it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by york international corp . and donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ 475 million debenture offering by chicago & north western acquisition corp. that was still being negotiated late last night . the issue by chicago & north western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar . some analysts said 0 the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk . since last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped . on wednesday , drexel burnham lambert inc. had to slash the size of continental airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million . salomon brothers inc. has delayed grand union co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction . last week , the grand union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock . prudential-bache said 0 the york issue was delayed because of market conditions . `` everything is going through firehoops right now , and -lcb- chicago & north western -rcb- is no exception , '' said mariel clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at citicorp . portfolio managers say 0 sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals . dan baldwin , managing director of high-yield investments at chancellor capital management , said the chicago & north western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package . if you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . '' mr. baldwin likes the offering . but several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said 0 they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class . while they consider the chicago & north western issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best . to lure buyers to the chicago & north western bonds , portfolio managers said 0 donaldson lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker . the bonds are expected to have a 14 1\/2 % coupon rate . the equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of cnw corp. , chicago & north western 's parent company . donaldson lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring . according to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from donaldson lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank blackstone group , which would reduce their cnw equity holdings by 5 % each . that would leave the blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and donaldson lufkin with 15 % . despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market . junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and petrolane gas service limited partnership rising one point . in the treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount . the gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows . that raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower . the labor department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected . but there were also rumors yesterday that several japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term treasurys . short-term treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher . yesterday , the fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system . the move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week . the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans . it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes . `` the fact that they did four-day matched sales means 0 they are not in a mood 0 to ease aggressively . they are telling us that -lcb- 8 3\/4 % -rcb- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said robert chandross at lloyds bank plc . treasury securities the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\/32 to yield 7.955 % , compared with 100 29\/32 to yield 8.032 % wednesday . the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\/32 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 26\/32 to yield 8.007 % . short-term rates rose yesterday . the discount rate on three-month treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . meanwhile , the treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday . the average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction sept. 21 . yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on july 27 . here are details of the auction : rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . the percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . corporate issues junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities . dealers said 0 junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and petrolane gas service limited partnership posting one-point gains . petrolane gas service 's 13 1\/4 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and rjr 's 13 1\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week . investment-grade bonds were unchanged . municipals activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the street and capped upward price movement in the sector . traders estimated that more than $ 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers . there was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios . according to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield . away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest . long dollar bonds were flat to up 3\/8 point . new jersey turnpike authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 3\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % , down 0.03 percentage point . the debt of some california issuers pulled off lows reached after tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said 0 market participants remained cautious . california expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official . it 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said 0 cindy katz , assistant director of california 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated . meanwhile , new issuance was slow . the largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the virginia public school authority . a balance of $ 25.8 million remained in late order-taking , according to the lead manager . mortgage-backed securities mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher , but lagged gains in the treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts . premium government national mortgage association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages . ginnie mae 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 30\/32 . if the refinancing plan clears congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them . in the current-coupon sector , a shift in the treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings . ginnie mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\/32 , up 9\/32 , and federal home loan mortgage corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\/32 , up 6\/32 . the ginnie mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 . while remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the treasury yield curve ,

mac yesterday . foreign bonds british government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson . the treasury 11

bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in west germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due october 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
