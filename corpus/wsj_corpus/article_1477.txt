rorer group inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , robert cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said 0 . his projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago . mr. cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of `` somewhat less than 10 % . '' through the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period . growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244.6 million a year ago . mr. cawthorn said 0 the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two rorer drugs . asilone , an antacid , was sold to boots plc , london . thrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to jones medical industries inc. , st. louis . he said 0 rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . as the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , mr. cawthorn said 0 . rorer in july had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 . he said 0 the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . '' mr. cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending july 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for rorer 's maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the u.s. had slipped in the first half of 1989 . he said 0 rorer opted to sell asilone and thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 . `` we had underfunded maalox for a year , '' he said 0 , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs . he said 0 rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period . a `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third quarter , he said 0 .
