the better business bureau of san diego and the state attorney general 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , better book inc . the settlement stems from charges that better book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 . without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories . the conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale . the attorney general 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry california businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by better book . the uproar led to the closing of the los angeles better business bureau in late 1987 .
