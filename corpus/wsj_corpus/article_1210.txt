we 've heard california 's property-tax-cutting proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but abc 's ted koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked democratic assemblyman richard katz if prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance . mr. katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that california 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes . both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of gasoline has fallen . dragging prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch .
