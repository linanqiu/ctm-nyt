bankers trust new york corp. won permission from the federal reserve board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary . the seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the securities industry association , a trade group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities . the fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite . several other banks have similar applications pending . over the past two years , the fed has given a handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms . securities firms have challenged those fed approvals , saying 0 they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses . however , the fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10 % of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such as dealing in u.s. treasurys . for some banks that 10 % ceiling created problems . but , by allowing bt securities inc. to handle private placements , the fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do . private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $ 1 million , that are sold to institutional investors and are n't registered with the securities and exchange commission . last year , bankers trust said 0 it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .
