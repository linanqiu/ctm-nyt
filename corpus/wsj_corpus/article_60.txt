`` the cosby show '' may have single-handedly turned around ratings at nbc since its debut in 1984 , and the huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing thursday night on the network . but some of the tv stations that bought `` cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days . the reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent tv stations that air the shows . but the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say 0 they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire . meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say 0 , the show 's distributor , viacom inc. , is giving an ultimatum : either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` cosby '' to a competitor . at the same time , viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` a different world , '' a spin-off of `` cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 . viacom denies 0 it 's using pressure tactics . `` we 're willing to negotiate , '' says dennis gillespie , executive vice president of marketing . `` we 're offering this plan now because we feel 0 it 's the right time . '' but , says 0 the general manager of a network affiliate in the midwest , `` i think 0 if i tell them 0 i need more time , they 'll take ` cosby ' across the street , '' viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks . one station manager says 0 he believes 0 viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years . `` cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago , according to a.c. nielsen co . mr. gillespie at viacom says 0 the ratings are rising . and executives at stations in such major markets as washington ; providence , r.i. ; cleveland ; raleigh , n.c. ; minneapolis , and louisville , ky. , say 0 they may very well not renew `` cosby . '' dick lobo , the general manager of wtvj , the nbc-owned station in miami , for example , says 0 the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . '' `` at the prices 0 we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar . there was n't . '' neil kuvin , the general manager of whas , the cbs affiliate in louisville , says 0 `` cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and 0 he 's `` pleased . '' but he adds , `` i feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with viacom .
