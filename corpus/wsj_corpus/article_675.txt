we are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` americans with disabilities act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by democratic senators kennedy and harkin '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most americans are hostile to the disabled ... . '' perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` it is surprising that george bush and the white house inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . '' this legislation was not drafted by a handful of democratic `` do-gooders . '' quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the national council on the handicapped , all appointed by president reagan . you depict the bill as something 0 democratic leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing . the opposite is true : it 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials . many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` americans with disabilities act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations . most national council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities . we know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told 0 there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled . your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the `` lawyers ' employment act . '' for the 43 million people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` emancipation proclamation . '' sandra swift parrino chairperson national council on the handicapped
