okay , now you can pick up that phone . but do n't do anything rash . after last friday 's stock-market plunge , investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks . not selling into a panic turned out to be very good advice : despite the market 's volatility , the dow jones industrial average has surged 114 points in the past four days . now , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some advisers say 0 it 's time for investors to take a hard , cold look at the stocks 0 they own and consider some careful pruning . `` the market is sending nervous signals , '' says 0 peter j. canelo , chief market strategist for bear , stearns & co. , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks . alan weston , president of weston capital management , a los angeles money-management firm , adds that in periods of uncertainty like today , `` it 's a good time 0 to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio . '' not everybody agrees that it 's time 0 to trim . `` we are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now , '' says steven g. einhorn , chairman of the investment policy committee of goldman , sachs & co . `` investors should stay with their stocks . we expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period , but we do n't think 0 it will be ugly . the downside is limited . '' and even those who say 0 some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets . any selling , they say 0 , should be well thought-out , and executed gradually , during market rallies . they offer these suggestions : get rid of the dogs . `` sell stocks that are n't doing well now , and that do n't have good earnings prospects , '' says alfred goldman , technical analyst at st. louis-based a.g. edwards & sons . `` most people do just the opposite : they sell their winners and keep their losers . '' which types of stocks are most likely to qualify ? technology stocks , says 0 mr. goldman . watch for earnings disappointments . a company does n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale , says 0 charles i. clough jr. , chief market strategist at merrill lynch & co . if earnings do n't live up to analysts ' expectations , he says 0 , that 's enough to dump the stock . john markese , director of research for the american association of individual investors , raises a cautionary note . `` substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment '' can be a mistake , he says 0 . an earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term . but mr. clough says , `` the risk is that earnings disappointments will continue . '' the economy is decelerating after six good years , and `` right now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later . '' which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks ? computer companies ; commodity cyclical stocks , like autos ; and retailing stocks , he says 0 . beware of heavy debt . the companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads , says 0 larry biehl , partner in the san mateo , calif. , money-management firm of bailard , biehl & kaiser . mr. canelo of bear stearns agrees : `` if we do have an economic slowdown , '' he says , `` companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse . '' the best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now , the two advisers say 0 . sell ` whisper ' stocks . ual corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going to happen to `` takeover stocks , '' says 0 mr. canelo . takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements , he says 0 . `` there 'll be fewer and fewer deals . '' moreover , many financial advisers say 0 individuals should be in the stock market as long-term investors , not as traders trying to catch the next hot stock . in general , they say 0 , avoid takeover stocks . compare p\/e ratios with prospects . mr. canelo suggests that investors compare price\/earnings ratios -lrb- the price of a share of stock divided by a company 's per-share earnings for a 12-month period -rrb- with projected growth rates . `` if you think 0 earnings will grow at 20 % a year , it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings , '' he says . `` but do n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15 % a year . '' mr. canelo thinks 0 the market will probably go higher , but `` will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there . '' mr. markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger . `` if you say sell anytime 0 a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 , that knocks out all your growth stocks , '' he says . `` you eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price . '' examine what has changed . tom schlesinger , market analyst at a.g. edwards & sons inc. , says 0 investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock . say 0 you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works . now , because of various difficulties , the product has been scrapped . time 0 to sell , says 0 mr. schlesinger . similarly , he says 0 , suppose 0 you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit $ 200 million by 1990 . if things have n't worked out that well , and sales wo n't hit $ 200 million until 1992 , it 's time 0 to consider selling , he says 0 .
