the white house called on congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill , but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea . earlier this month , the white house endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the gramm-rudman act . but now that congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the gramm-rudman targets , the white house said 0 it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill , on which congress continues to work . `` if that does n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said press secretary marlin fitzwater . on capitol hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill . texas rep. william archer , the ranking republican on the house ways and means committee said , `` i do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there . meanwhile , president bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut . the white house said 0 he plans to hold a series of private white house meetings , mostly with senate democrats , to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut . the first meeting yesterday was with 10 senate democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax . according to some who attended , the senators argued that the president should give the democratic leaders in congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending . the president was said to have been noncommittal .
