president bush will veto a bill funding the departments of labor , education and health and human services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest , the white house said 0 . mr. bush had threatened a veto previously . but he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president . white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 0 negotiations between bush aides and lawmakers ended monday without success . most lawmakers think 0 it will be extremely difficult for mr. bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto . but there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $ 156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began oct. 1 . mr. bush has said 0 he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape , incest and danger to the life of the mother . but he has opposed medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say 0 they are victims of rape and incest , arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women .
