valley federal savings & loan association said 0 imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo . the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. , whose spokesman said 0 the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements . the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received . the transaction , announced in august , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in california 's san joaquin valley . terms were n't disclosed , but valley federal had said 0 it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually . valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp. , which said 0 it is attempting to meet community reinvestment act requirements . valley federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in van nuys . imperial corp. , based in san diego , is the parent of imperial savings & loan . in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million .
