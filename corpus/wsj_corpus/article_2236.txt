it was friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points . just a coincidence ? or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ? in academia , a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors . robert kolb and ricardo rodriguez , professors of finance at the university of miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th . but their study , which spanned the 1962-85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data . in the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the you-know-what . but the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to yale hirsch , a collector of stock market lore . another study found that the 82 fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices . on the only other friday the 13th this year , the dow jones industrial average rose about four points . professor kolb says 0 the original study , titled friday the 13th , part vii , was published tongue-in-cheek . in a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in friday 's market activity .
