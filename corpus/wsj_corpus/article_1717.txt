the government said 0 13.1 % of americans , or 31.9 million people , were living in poverty in 1988 . while last year 's figure was down from 13.4 % in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate , the census bureau said 0 the 1988 drop was n't statistically significant . the bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988 , the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before . summarizing data derived from a march 1989 survey of 58,000 households , william butz , associate director of the census bureau , said that `` most groups either stayed the same or improved . '' but , he added 0 , `` since the late 1960s , the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal . there was no reversal -lcb- of that trend -rcb- between 1987 and 1988 . '' per capita income , a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health , hit a record in 1988 , rising 1.7 % after inflation adjustment to $ 13,120 . but the median income of american families fell 0.2 % , the first time 0 it has failed to rise since 1982 . mr. butz said 0 the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure , including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by americans who are n't living in families . as a result of last year 's decline , the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000 . the poverty threshold , defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the agricultural department , last year was $ 12,092 for a family of four . the census bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line , but it does n't consider other government benefits , such as medicare . thanks largely to the continued growth of the u.s. economy , the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3 % , but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years . poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other americans . in 1988 , 31.6 % of blacks lived in poverty , compared with 10.1 % for whites and 26.8 % for hispanics . but two-thirds of all poor americans were white . more than half of poor families were headed by women living without men , the bureau said 0 . more than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women . the poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7 % from 20.5 % in 1987 , but remained far higher than a decade ago . the rate among the elderly -- 12 % in 1988 -- was n't significantly lower than the year before . if it were n't for social security payments , more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line , mr. butz said 0 . the census bureau also said : -- some 17.2 % of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5 % of all families , up from 16.9 % in 1987 . that is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950 , although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison . -- the top fifth of all families got 44 % of the income , up from 41.5 % a decade earlier . the bottom fifth of all families got 4.6 % of the income , down from 5.2 % a decade earlier . -- confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation , earnings of year-round , full-time male workers fell 1.3 % in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices , the first such drop since 1982 . earnings of female workers were unchanged . -- women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men , a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978 . -- median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who are n't -- rose 0.3 % last year to $ 27,225 after inflation . it rose sharply in the northeast and midwest and fell slightly in the south and west . median family income was $ 32,191 , down 0.2 % . -- per capita income of blacks , though still only 60 % that of whites , rose 3.9 % in 1988 , while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5 % . -- among married couples , the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply , as income of black families shot up 6.8 % while income of whites did n't budge . fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years , the census bureau also said 0 its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983 . the bureau said 0 some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5 % instead of 13.1 % -- under the alternative calculation . critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years . a report by the staff of the joint economic committee of congress released yesterday concluded , `` it is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes . '' the official poverty threshold is set by the office of management and budget .
