newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said 0 it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers . the new ad plan from newsweek , a unit of the washington post co. , is the second incentive plan 0 the magazine has offered advertisers in three years . plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between newsweek , time warner inc. 's time magazine , and mortimer b. zuckerman 's u.s. news & world report . alan spoon , recently named newsweek president , said 0 newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in january . a full , four-color page in newsweek will cost $ 100,980 . in mid-october , time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in time costs about $ 120,000 . u.s. news has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates . newsweek said 0 it will introduce the circulation credit plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . '' the magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 . mr. spoon said 0 the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to publishers information bureau . `` what matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said mr. spoon . both newsweek and u.s. news have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches . however , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently . according to audit bureau of circulations , time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % . newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year . u.s. news ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % .
