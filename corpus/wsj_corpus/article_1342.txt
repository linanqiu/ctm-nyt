if growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash . some stock pickers already are targeting the otc market , where , they say 0 , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks . best of all , they add 0 , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the new york stock exchange , are languishing at depressed prices . growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think 0 , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements . against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal . `` the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares mary farrell , a painewebber analyst . among her otc picks are oshkosh b'gosh and a&w brands . like many otc growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million . some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long . these are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records . while many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum . that 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks . `` you can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says 0 john palicka , chief portfolio manager at midco investors , a newark , n.j. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes . mr. palicka 's picks from the otc market include legent , mail boxes etc. , and payco american . the main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy . `` if the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says l. keith mullins , a growth-stock analyst at morgan stanley . eventually , he believes 0 , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth . in anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now . understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently . the average issue on standard & poor 's 500-stock index gained 35 % last year , ms. farrell of painewebber says 0 . smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % . in addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year . also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder 0 to buy and sell quickly than blue chips . as a result , morgan stanley 's index of 40 emerging growth stocks -- most of which are in the otc market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the dow jones industrial average has leaped 24 % and the s&p 500 has grown 25 % . the nasdaq composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % . some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results . `` people are naturally suspicious of them , '' says mr. mullins of morgan stanley . among his favorites in his firm 's index are legent , silicon graphics and novell . however , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance . mark schoeppner , portfolio manager at pittsburgh-based quaker capital management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt 0 the company can support . '' barney hallingby , managing director of research at hambrecht & quist , also believes 0 earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions . on friday , hambrecht & quist added st. jude medical to the list of 20 stocks 0 it strongly recommends . the opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , mr. hallingby says 0 . st. jude 's market value on nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock . the medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 . kurt kruger , who follows the stock for hambrecht & quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15 a share this year . st. jude finished up 1\/4 to 44 1\/2 on friday . friday 's market activity the nasdaq composite index eased 0.13 to 470.67 . the composite finished up 0.7 % from last friday 's close . it was a busy week for otc stocks . friday 's volume totaled 158.2 million shares ; the daily average for the week was a bustling 176.7 million . valley national lost 1 3\/8 to 17 1\/8 on volume of 1.9 million shares . the company reported a big third-quarter loss on thursday . merchants bank of new york lost 1 to 106 after reporting that its third-quarter net income fell to $ 1.62 a share from last year 's $ 1.67 a share . eliot savings bank lost 7\/8 to 1 5\/8 after reporting that it had a $ 4.8 million loss in the latest third quarter mostly because of loan-loss provisions . in the 1988 quarter , the bank earned $ 1.1 million . one bank stock was a winner . banponce jumped 4 1\/2 to 47 3\/4 after agreeing to be acquired by banco popular de puerto rico for $ 56.25 a share . banco popular , meanwhile , dropped 1 1\/4 to 21 1\/2 . sierra tucson , an initial public offering , made the most active list . the company 's shares began trading at 12 1\/2 , up from its initial offering price of 12 , and closed at 13 . sierra tucson operates an addiction treatment center . among declining issues , a weak earnings outlook drove groundwater technology down 6 1\/4 to 24 . the company said 0 results for its second quarter ended oct. 28 could drop as much as 20 % below the 30 cents a share reported in the year-earlier quarter . medstone international plummeted 3 1\/4 to 7 1\/4 . a food and drug administration advisory panel has asked that medstone perform more studies on its device 0 to treat gallstones . qintex entertainment dropped 2 5\/8 to 1 1\/2 after seeking protection from creditor lawsuits under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code for itself and its two operating subsidiaries , hal roach studios and qintex productions . raymond corp. lost 1 to 10 after it said late thursday that it will take a $ 4.4 million charge in its third quarter for reserves 0 to cover potential charges in connection with the closing and sale of a manufacturing plant . as a result , the company has suspended its quarterly dividend . mccaw cellular communications and its target , lin broadcasting , were active . lin added 5\/8 to 110 5\/8 and mccaw lost 1\/4 to 41 . mccaw said 0 it has secured commitments from three banks to help finance its $ 125-a-share bid for 22 million of lin 's shares . mccaw has called for a `` fair auction '' of lin , which earlier entered a stock-swap merger pact with bellsouth . following the release of the company 's fourth-quarter earnings , apple computer dropped 3\/4 to 48 on volume of more than 2.3 million shares . apple earned $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share , in the quarter , including $ 48 million from the sale of its adobe systems stock .
