oh , that terrible mr. ortega . just when american liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the contras and their friend ronald reagan , along comes mr. ortega in costa rica this weekend to `` blunder '' into the hands of what are often called conservatives . conservatives are the faction in u.s. politics which always said that mr. ortega and his friends do n't want to hold an election in nicaragua . liberals are the faction that says , give peace a chance ; now they are saying 0 mr. ortega should give them a break , lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages . we suspect 0 daniel ortega knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy . he knows that making george bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger noriegan fulminations , and that announcing an end to the liberals ' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the contras ' military activities in northern nicaragua . mr. ortega understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the sandinista movement is not democratic peace , but nondemocratic unpeace . it is the presence of internal and external `` enemies '' which justifies the need for a large , active army that mikhail gorbachev 's soviet union continues to supply with bullets .
