japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the u.s. federal national mortgage association said 0 . the purchases show the strong interest of japanese investors in u.s. mortgage-based instruments , fannie mae 's chairman , david o. maxwell , said 0 at a news conference . he said 0 more than 90 % of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors . the rest went to investors from france and hong kong . earlier this year , japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund . that fund was put together by blackstone group , a new york investment bank . the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman , sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co . the new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to japanese investors . first , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates . second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors . by addressing those problems , mr. maxwell said 0 , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. . '' such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate . they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt , buying $ 2.4 billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued .
