south africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $ 8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding , said 0 chris stals , governor of the reserve bank and the country 's chief debt negotiator . the new agreement will last for 3 1\/2 years starting july 1 , 1990 , when the current agreement expires . the announcement coincides with the start of the commonwealth ministers conference in kuala lumpur , where proposals for renewed sanctions against south africa , including moves 0 to block settling of a new debt agreement , were scheduled to be discussed . as with the previous pact , the new agreement covers the country 's debt `` inside the net , '' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector . the agreement calls for south african debtors to make repayments in eight installments , starting in december of next year . the redemption then would be at 1.5 % of the total debt , increasing to 2.5 % in february 1991 , and to 3 % at six-month intervals thereafter . a revised provision would be included for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net . these claims would be repayable over a 10-year period . foreign debt falling outside the net of affected indebtedness -- which mr. stahl estimated at $ 12 billion -- would remain not subject to the debt arrangements .
