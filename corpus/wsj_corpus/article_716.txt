the financial accounting standards board said 0 it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments . but the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments . the balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt 0 the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures . under the initial proposal , for example , banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted . the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses , which appears on the balance sheet . the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . it will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . the rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument . scott miller , an fasb project manager , said that a final rule will be issued before year end . but he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months .
