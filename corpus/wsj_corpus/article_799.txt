the big three u.s. auto makers posted losses in their core north american automotive businesses for the third quarter , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period . the strongest sign of the big three 's woes came from ford motor co. , which said 0 it had a loss in its u.s. automotive business for the first time since 1982 . ford predicted 0 fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level , partly because of a likely $ 500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations . the bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non-automotive operations . still , the combined profit of ford , chrysler corp. and general motors corp. fell 44 % to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.83 billion a year earlier , excluding a one-time gain of $ 309 million at chrysler from the sale of mitsubishi motors corp. stock . the last time 0 all three companies reported north american automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982 . yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market . gm 's common closed at $ 44.375 a share , down 50 cents , ford fell 37.5 cents to end at $ 47.50 , and chrysler eased 37.5 cents to $ 22.25 , all in new york stock exchange composite trading . the market 's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in detroit . as japanese auto makers gained market share , the big three , with gm in the lead , slashed north american production and launched a retail discounting blitz . the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more than $ 1,000 a vehicle , according to industry officials . gm probably had the `` heaviest incentives , '' said 0 robert s. miller , chrysler 's chief financial officer . `` we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them . '' but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains , and domestic car sales have plunged 19 % since the big three ended many of their programs sept. 30 . gm , ford and chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter u.s. output plans an estimated 15 % from 1988 levels . if sales do n't pick up , the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again . ford , which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn , saw earnings take a beating . the no. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market -- for a 44 % drop in net to $ 477.1 million , or $ 1.03 a share , on revenue of $ 20.24 billion . nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive operations . the dearborn , mich. , auto maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the u.s. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter . ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services . a year earlier , ford reported record net of $ 856.3 million , or $ 1.78 a share , on revenue of $ 20.38 billion . in the latest nine months , ford earned $ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a share , compared with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a share . the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the 1989 second quarter . but david n. mccammon , vice president , finance , insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when ford had net losses . still , mr. mccammon said 0 ford expects the u.s. economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production . as a result , fourth-quarter profit will come in below 1988 results , although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the 44 % third-quarter decline , he said 0 . part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ 500 million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit . in the 1988 fourth quarter , ford had net of $ 1.16 billion , or $ 2.42 a share . chrysler 's operating profit fell to a scant $ 22 million , or 10 cents a share , its lowest quarterly total in seven years . its $ 309 million , or $ 1.32 a share , gain from the sale of 75 million mitsubishi shares made net $ 331 million , or $ 1.42 a share . sales were flat at $ 7.88 billion . the results include record quarterly earnings of $ 76 million from chrysler financial corp . a year earlier , chrysler 's net was $ 113 million , or 50 cents a share . mr. miller said 0 costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the highland park , mich. , company 's north american car and truck business . he said 0 the loss was n't `` that much different '' from ford 's $ 37 million loss on u.s. automotive operations , but he declined to be specific . mr. miller said 0 chrysler spent an average of $ 1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter , compared with about $ 450 a vehicle a year earlier -- a `` high-water mark '' at the time . he said 0 chrysler `` is no longer sure '' of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year . consumers , he said 0 , are balking at higher prices on 1990 cars , especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on 1989 models . in the nine months , net was $ 1.02 billion , or $ 4.38 a share , including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale , compared with $ 617 million , or $ 2.77 a share , after a charge of $ 93 million , or 42 cents a share , for plant closings in the 1988 period . sales rose 8.4 % to $ 27.95 billion from $ 25.78 billion . heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ 516.9 million from a record $ 859.2 million . detroit-based gm does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business . but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ 300 million on domestic vehicle operations . an 8.5 % drop in north american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue , and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period , a gm spokesman said 0 . but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations . in one breakdown , gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , electronic data systems corp. and gm hughes electronics corp . meanwhile , gm said 0 overseas auto operations are on track 0 to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ 2.7 billion . the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves , exclusive of its financial subsidiary , to $ 5.5 billion as of sept. 30 , a 22 % increase from a year earlier . this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled 9.5 % . under the circumstances , it wo n't be easy for gm to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $ 1.4 billion , the spokesman acknowledged 0 . that means 0 it 's unlikely 0 the company will surpass last year 's $ 4.9 billion full-year profit , even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9 % to $ 3.52 billion on revenue of $ 95.57 billion . it earned $ 3.46 billion on revenue of $ 91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months .
