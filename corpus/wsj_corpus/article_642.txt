a unit of dpc acquisition partners launched a $ 10-a-share tender offer for the shares outstanding of dataproducts corp. , and said 0 it would seek to liquidate the computer-printer maker `` as soon as possible , '' even if a merger is n't consummated . dpc acquisition is controlled by crescott investment associates , wilson investment group , kernel corp. and catalyst partners . the investor group owns 1,534,600 dataproducts common shares , or a 7.6 % stake . the offer is based on several conditions , including obtaining financing . dpc acquisition said 0 it had received the reasonable assurance of chase manhattan bank n.a. that the financing can be obtained . in a filing with the securities and exchange commission , dpc acquisition said 0 it expects 0 it will need about $ 215 million to buy the shares and pay related fees and expenses . dpc acquisition added that it has not begun discussions with financing sources , and said 0 it expected to repay the amounts borrowed through proceeds of the liquidation . dataproducts officials declined to comment , and said 0 they had not yet seen a suit filed in federal court by dpc acquisition that seeks to nullify a standstill agreement between dpc acquisition and dataproducts . earlier this year , dpc acquisition made a $ 15-a-share offer for dataproducts , which the dataproducts board said 0 it rejected because the $ 283.7 million offer was not fully financed . dataproducts has since started a restructuring , and has said 0 it is not for sale .
