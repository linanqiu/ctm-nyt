despite a deluge of economic news , the treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over international business machines corp. 's huge debt offering . `` there were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said kathleen camilli , a money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc . `` so the focus turned to other fixed-income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said . ibm , the giant computer maker , offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1\/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year treasury bonds . the size of ibm 's issue was increased from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds . in the investment-grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said 0 james ednie , a drexel industrial bond trader . money managers ranked ibm 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-a credit are infrequent . syndicate officials at lead underwriter salomon brothers inc. said 0 the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors . in the treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy . `` whether you thought 0 the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said charles lieberman , a managing director at manufacturers hanover securities corp . the government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in september while construction spending was slightly lower . both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all . a survey by the federal reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the national association of purchasing management blurred that picture of the economy . in a monthly report prepared for use at the fed 's next federal open market committee meeting on nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks . among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries . the philadelphia and cleveland districts , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the boston , dallas and san francisco banks noted that business expanded . the purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in october , although it remains below 50 % . a reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding . mr. lieberman said 0 the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . '' the employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out tomorrow . the average estimate of 22 economists polled by dow jones capital markets report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in october . the economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % . treasury securities in a surprise announcement , the treasury said 0 it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt . the treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year notes . but rather than sell new 30-year bonds , the treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in august . credit market analysts said 0 the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1\/8 % bond due august 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount . some dealers said 0 the treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur . the treasury said 0 the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling . until such action takes places , the treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind . meanwhile , treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading . the benchmark 30-year bond about 1\/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . the benchmark was priced at 102 22\/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12\/32 to yield 7.90 % tuesday

meanwhile , most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1\/8 point higher . in its latest compilation of performance statistics , moody 's investors service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in october while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % . moody 's said 0 those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer-term treasury notes and bonds . total return measures price changes and interest income . for the year to date , moody 's said 0 total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment-grade bonds . junk bonds trailed the group again . `` even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote moody 's economist john lonski in yesterday 's market report . `` little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said . moody 's said 0 the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in october . mortgage-backed issues mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the treasury market . ginnie mae 's 9 % issue for november delivery finished at 98 5\/8 , up 2\/32 , and its 9 1\/2 % issue at 100 22\/32 , also up 2\/32 . the ginnie mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.32 % to a 12-year average life . activity was light in

responsible . the issue could be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter . a $ 107.03 million offering of santa ana community redevelopment agency , calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter donaldson lufkin & jenrette

bonds from detroit , mich. , apparently drew solid investor interest . they were tentatively priced to yield from 6.20 % in 1991 to 7.272 % in foreign bond west german dealers said 0 there was little interest in treasury bonds ahead of thursday 's new government bond issue . so far , they said 0 , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7 % . it is generally expected to be the usual 10-year , four billion mark issue . rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last
