the carnage among takeover stocks friday does n't mean the end of mega-mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , wall street 's big-time deal makers say . suitors from now on are more likely to be expansion-minded companies , rather than raiders or debt-happy financiers . and they will be launching lower-priced and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them . this is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale . whenever the 1980s merger boom seems to be stalling , shock waves ripple through the stock market . `` the market is overvalued , not cheap , '' says alan gaines of the new york money-management firm gaines berland . he recently began increasing his cash position to 45 % of his portfolio . `` i look at where deals can get done , '' he says , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices . lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers , investment bankers say 0 . `` you had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says steven rattner , a partner and merger specialist with lazard freres & co . trading dried up friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . it was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening last month after campeau hit a cash crunch . and banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . the group trying to buy ual announced friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans 0 it needs to buy the parent of united airlines for $ 300 a share . takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any ual developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy . investment bankers representing the buy-out group and ual 's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks . after ual , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is american airlines ' parent amr , the target of a $ 120-a-share takeover proposal from new york real estate developer donald trump . trading in amr shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. edt friday and did n't resume . before the halt , amr last traded at 98 5\/8 . late friday night , the london office of jefferies & co. , a los angeles securities firm , traded amr shares at prices as low as 80 . similarly , delta air lines and usair group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on friday and could weaken further . over the weeked , however , two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and wall street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies . vitro s.a. , a major mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy anchor glass container in a tender offer for $ 21.25 a share , sweetened from the original $ 20-a-share offer 0 vitro launched two months ago . on friday , anchor shares fell 1 1\/4 to close at 18 1\/2 . for the broader market , the greatest significance of the vitro-anchor deal may be that it was put together late friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities and a $ 139 million loan from security pacific national bank . moreover , to complete the entire anchor glass purchase and refinance existing debt , donaldson said 0 it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for vitro , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market . donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be sold before donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back . security pacific , meanwhile , said 0 it expects to arrange $ 430 million in bank loans for vitro . in another takeover battle , a spokesman for mccaw cellular communications said yesterday that mccaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' 0 they can arrange $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for mccaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of lin broadcasting , `` notwithstanding recent events . '' mccaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million lin shares , thereby challenging lin 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ 20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with bellsouth 's cellular business . on friday , lin shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 . traders and investment bankers said 0 lin shares were n't hurt much because bellsouth is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers . investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock-market drop . potential bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says 0 mr. rattner of lazard . `` nothing makes things look cheaper than a 200-point drop in the dow , '' mr. rattner says . `` just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market , there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market . '' investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well-heeled corporations . `` in the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from lbo firms , which were often prepared to outbid '' the corporations , says 0 j. tomilson hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson lehman hutton . now , `` corporate buyers should be willing to re-enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond-financed buyers has been reduced . '' many takeover stocks plunged friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks , the targets of rumored deals . columbia pictures entertainment , which has agreed to a friendly $ 27-a-share bid from sony of japan , fell only 1\/8 to close at 26 5\/8 . but several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more . they include usx , down 11.7 % ; upjohn , down 11.1 % ; campbell soup , down 11 % ; paramount communications , off 10.3 % ; woolworth , down 10.2 % ; delta air lines , down 10.1 % , and mca , down 9.7 % . the market -- and investment bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again . examples include kollmorgen , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a share by vernitron collapsed last month . kollmorgen shares fell nearly 20 % on friday to close at 12 7\/8 . ramada , which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 . ramada has said 0 it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so . shares of american medical international , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes first boston corp. and the pritzker family of chicago , fell 15.8 % on friday to close at 20 . the buy-out group is offering $ 26.50 a share for 63 million american medical shares , down from its offer in july of $ 28 a share for 68.8 million shares . but investment bankers say 0 the market may have oversold some takeover-related stocks . hilton hotels , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling 20.2 % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on friday . hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . people familiar with hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . however , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the ual buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers . hilton officials said 0 they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . william lebo , hilton 's general counsel , said 0 plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . '' `` i ca n't believe that any potential buyer for hilton would be affected by one day 's trading , '' mr. lebo said . but the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks . for debt-ridden suitors , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says 0 new york money manager neil weisman of chilmark capital , who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash . `` the market is just waking up to that point .
