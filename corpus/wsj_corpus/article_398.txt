a group of michigan investors has offered to buy knight-ridder inc. 's ailing detroit free press for $ 68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed . the offer came just prior to arguments before the u.s. supreme court over whether the free press should be allowed to enter into a joint operating pact with gannett co. 's detroit news . the group led by birmingham , mich. , publicist william d. mcmaster did n't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute to the offer . indeed , some individuals identified with the group said 0 they have n't committed any money to the bid and were n't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend . knight-ridder would n't comment on the offer . the company has said 0 the paper is n't for sale , and has rebuffed mr. mcmaster 's earlier requests for access to free press financial statements . in his letter to knight-ridder president james k. batten , mr. mcmaster said 0 he arrived at the $ 68 million figure using knight-ridder 's corporate financial statements and comments by knight-ridder officials that the free press has a $ 50 million value in salvage . but in an interview , mr. mcmaster said 0 he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before firming up the offer .
