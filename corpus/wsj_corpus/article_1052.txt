`` the famous teddy z , '' which cbs inc. had hoped 0 would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule , is n't turning out to be the hit 0 the network envisaged . although the half-hour situation comedy seen mondays at 9:30 p.m . eastern and pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation , it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce 0 `` teddy z '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot , replacing `` the people next door , '' which became the first network show 0 to be canceled this season . `` teddy z , '' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a hollywood talent agency , was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow `` murphy brown , '' a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring candice bergen . `` teddy z '' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with k mart corp . it was promoted on cable services , including mtv , nick at night and vh-1 , and premiered as the no. 22-rated show for the week . but five weeks after the premiere , the series has floundered . in figures released yesterday by a.c. nielsen co . `` teddy z , '' produced by the television unit of columbia pictures entertainment inc. , was in 37th place . worse , every week it suffers audience drop-off from `` murphy brown '' and viewership on cbs picks up again once `` teddy z '' is over and is followed by `` designing women . '' `` there is strong indication that ` teddy z ' is not compatible with the shows 0 it is surrounding , '' said john sisk , senior vice president at j. walter thompson co. , a unit of wpp group plc . last week , `` murphy brown '' was viewed by 14.1 % of the available television households , while the number dropped to 12.6 % for `` teddy z '' and rose to 14.2 % for `` designing women . '' cbs executives said 0 the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes . creator hugh wilson , for example , included the lead character 's greek family in the cast , `` but that is not the right focus anymore , '' said 0 one cbs executive . instead , cbs hopes 0 the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent . `` we 're making adjustments on the show , yes , but nothing radical , '' said craig nelson , the story consultant on `` teddy z . '' `` but we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family . '' the opening credits are being redone , mr. nelson said 0 , `` to make teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning . those viewers find the show confusing .
