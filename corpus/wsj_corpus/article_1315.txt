president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money 0 defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to inflict . if the request is approved by both the house and senate , mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money , according to senate budget analysts . that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has . `` it 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said chairman james sasser -lrb- d. , tenn . -rrb- of the senate budget committee , who said 0 he would oppose the request . `` that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said . the president 's request did n't indicate how mr. cheney would shift the money . a pentagon official said 0 the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' 0 to deal with the cuts . last week , budget director richard darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget . that would give agencies `` less ability ... to fudge over things , '' he told 0 reporters . under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled . lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law .
