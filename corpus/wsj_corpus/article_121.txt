program trading is `` a racket , '' complains 0 edward egnuss , a white plains , n.y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . '' but although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts 0 it could be stopped . mr. egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by wall street journal reporters across the country . but like mr. egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt 0 it should be . `` i think 0 program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says leo fields , a dallas investor . he notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading . but he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility . he also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds . he adds : `` the market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . '' or , as dorothy arighi , an interior decorator in arnold , calif. , puts it : `` all kinds of funny things spook the market these days . '' but she believes that `` program trading creates deviant swings . it 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . '' she adds that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea . '' at the charles schwab & co. office in atlanta 's buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading . citing the october 1987 crash , glenn miller says , `` it 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . '' a. donald anderson , a 59-year-old los angeles investor who says 0 the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading . those who still want to do it `` will just find some way 0 to get around '' any attempt to curb it . similarly , rick wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` i ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . '' yet he is n't in favor of new legislation . `` i think 0 we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says . `` i 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . '' peter anthony , who runs an employment agency in new york , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure 0 it should be more strictly regulated . `` i do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains . and surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say 0 they can live with program trading . glenn britta , a 25-year-old new york financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says 0 he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . '' he adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market . you ca n't hold back technology . '' and the practice should n't be stopped , he says 0 , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . '' also in new york , israel silverman , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but i do n't think 0 it should be banned . there 's no culprit here . the market is just becoming more efficient . '' arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says 0 . he adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund . but `` i 'm a long-term investor , '' he says . `` if you were a short-term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . '' jim enzor of atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge . `` if we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` buy , ' '' he explains . `` if you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . '' what else can a small investor do ? scott taccetta , a chicago accountant , is going into money-market funds . mr. taccetta says 0 he had just recouped the $ 5,000 0 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last oct. 13 . now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 . in october , before the market dropped , mrs. arighi of arnold , calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused by program trading . she believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . '' lucille gorman , an 84-year-old chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts . mrs. gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the oct. 13 plunge . `` my stocks are all blue chips , '' she says . `` if the market goes down , i figure 0 it 's paper profits 0 i 'm losing . on the other hand , if it goes way sky high , i always sell . you do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .
