investors who received shearson lehman hutton inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions . the first 10 pages of the 76-page weekly portfolio perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers . rather than printing devils , shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . the plunge made shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . in fact , last friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on fridays for dissemination the following week . shearson , a 62%-owned unit of american express co. , did n't have enough time 0 to update its market commentary so , `` we decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says jack rivkin , the head of shearson 's research department . the first thought 0 some investors had was that a red-faced shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages . investors recalled that shearson last week had been advising that `` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . '' many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views . but mr. rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish . instead , he says 0 , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message 0 we wanted to deliver '' on monday . as mr. rivkin explains it , `` we were raising some caution flags about rate rises in europe and concerns about the lbo market . and by late friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided 0 that was the wrong tone 0 to take . with the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . '' both before and after the friday plunge , shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash .
