many of the nation 's highest-ranking executives saluted friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players . assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think 0 friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating . `` this is a reaction to artificial lbo valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said john young , chairman of hewlett-packard co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 . `` if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense , it will be a big plus . '' a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council , a group that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism . `` people wish 0 the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about donald trump , '' said rand araskog , chairman of itt corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 . `` where 's the leadership ? where 's the guy who can say : 0 ` enough is enough ' '' ? the executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes . `` i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , '' said kenneth olsen , digital equipment corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 . `` i did n't bother calling anybody ; i did n't even turn on tv . '' `` there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added john smale , whose procter & gamble co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 . `` the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem . '' of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists . indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by friday 's events was robert crandall , chairman of amr corp. , the parent of american airlines and the target of a takeover offer by mr. trump . asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being trumped by the new york real estate magnate , mr. crandall smiled broadly and said : `` no comment . '' on friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business leaders issued a report predicting 0 the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2 % annual rate , through next year , then accelerate anew in 1991 . of the 19 economists who worked on the business council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said 0 lewis preston , chairman of j.p. morgan & co. and vice chairman of the business council .
