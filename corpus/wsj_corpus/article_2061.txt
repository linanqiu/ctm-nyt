hydro-quebec said 0 it notified central maine power co. 0 it will cancel a $ 4 billion contract to supply electricity to the maine utility . the provincially owned utility said 0 it is tearing up the deal because `` the contract 's objectives ca n't be fulfilled . '' hydro-quebec said 0 maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through maine to other utilities . `` it would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992 , '' a hydro-quebec official said . the contract was to run from 1992 to 2020 . under the contract hydro-quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to central maine power starting in 1992 , 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in hydro-quebec said 0 maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means 0 central maine power has lost its place in line . `` we wo n't sign any new contracts -lcb- with deliveries -rcb- beginning earlier than 2000 , '' the hydro-quebec official said . he said 0 hydro-quebec already has some `` customers in mind '' for the power that was to be delivered to maine . `` nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that hydro-quebec was the lowest-cost , most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year 2020 , '' said central maine senior vice president donald f. kelly . central maine said 0 it is evaluating `` many energy options '' 0 to make up for the lost future power , including new energy generation and management proposals from new england , and possibly new canadian purchases .
