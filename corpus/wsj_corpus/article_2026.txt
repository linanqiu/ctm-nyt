no strikeout , but certainly no home run . that 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead , according to money managers and a few brokers . yesterday 's 88-point recovery from friday 's megadrop in the dow jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again . but quite a few money managers are n't buying it . weakening corporate earnings , they say 0 , are no prescription for a bull market . `` the stock market ai n't going to do much of anything '' for a while , says 0 john neff of wellington management , who runs the $ 8.3 billion windsor fund . he suspects that friday 's market decline may have a second leg , perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on . mr. neff says 0 the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the `` lbo sweepstakes '' -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines . after sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before friday 's sell-off , mr. neff says 0 he bought `` a narrow list of stocks '' yesterday . with flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990 , money managers say 0 price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time . `` this is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , '' says george collins , president of the mutual fund company t. rowe price associates in baltimore . according to institutional brokers estimate system , wall street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good -lrb- they did soar 36 % in 1988 -rrb- . bulls say 0 the market is an incredible bargain , priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the standard & poor 's 500 index . before the 1987 crash , the p\/e was more than 20 . the common view , says 0 abby cohen , strategist for drexel burnham lambert , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory . our view is that we may see a profit decline . '' some think 0 investors should sell into rallies . the market `` is going to wind down , '' says 0 gerald w. perritt , a chicago money manager . `` things are a little less overpriced '' after friday 's jolt in the market . he expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 `` between now and june . '' after friday 's decline , mr. perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by benjamin graham , an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis . he found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued . nicholas parks , a new york money manager , expects the market to decline about 15 % . `` i 've been two-thirds in cash since july , and i continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , '' he says . companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years `` will continue to surface as business problems . '' `` generalizations about value are n't useful , '' says new york money manager john lefrere of delta capital management . for instance , he says 0 , international business machines and unisys might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like walt disney , procter & gamble and coca-cola , strong performers in recent years . money manager robert ross , head of duncan ross associates ltd. in vancouver , british columbia , says 0 stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives . fredric russell , a money manager in tulsa , okla. , says 0 friday 's cave-in `` is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than wall street would want to admit . '' there are still bulls out there . `` i still think 0 we will have a 3000 dow , whether it 's six months or 12 months from now i do n't know , '' says david dreman , managing partner of dreman value management in new york . `` we 're doing a little buying '' in some stocks `` that have really been smashed down . '' many brokerage house officials also are optimistic . yesterday , goldman sachs , merrill lynch and dean witter all increased the proportion of assets 0 they recommend 0 investors commit to stocks . dean witter now recommends 85 % , goldman 65 % and merrill lynch 50 % . some investors say 0 friday 's sell-off was a good thing , because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation . `` it was a healthy cleansing , '' says michael holland , who runs salomon brothers asset management in new york . from here out , these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing , based on a company 's ability to show profit growth . `` the fundamentals are pretty strong , '' mr. dreman says . `` i do n't see this as a bear market at all . it 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the lbo market . '' friday 's big fall was `` just a blunder by the stock market , '' says 0 john connolly , chief strategist for dean witter . `` it was an overreaction to an event -lcb- the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of ual -rcb- that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . '' many investors have nagging worries , however . newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans . that hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks . not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead . `` disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters , '' says mary farrell , a market strategist at painewebber . she thinks 0 the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher . companies with steady earnings growth could do well , she says 0 , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 % .
