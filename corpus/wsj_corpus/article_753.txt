i was impressed by the perceptiveness of your sept. 12 story `` rural enterprise : tough row 0 to hoe . '' we lived in rural areas many years , but now live in st. louis county , mo . this morning as i drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey , i thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening . the presence of so many people , cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live . i thought back to our time in small , sparsely populated communities . i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established , stake-holding residents , and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging , `` safe '' ways of thought and action . i remembered being fired at age 44 , with five children at home , when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid , small-town employer . how difficult it is for a thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past . now , i revel in the freedom , culture , activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects . yet when my youngest child died two years ago , i buried him in the church cemetery of a small missouri town . so after all , even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce , rural virtues thought to exist amid fields , forests and country lanes . ronald edwin parsons ballwin , mo .
