fujitsu ltd. said 0 it wants to withdraw its controversial one-yen bid to design a waterworks computer system for the city of hiroshima . meanwhile , japan 's fair trade commission said 0 it was considering launching an investigation into whether the bid , the equivalent of less than a penny , violates anti-monopoly laws . hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor , expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project . eight companies submitted bids , but fujitsu won the contract by essentially saying 0 it would do the job for free . news of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers . fujitsu itself , which said 0 the bid had n't been approved by its headquarters , was clearly embarrassed . the bid was n't `` socially acceptable , '' a company spokeswoman said 0 . hiroshima officials said 0 they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it . they said 0 they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do .
