in finding `` good news '' in berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan -lrb- `` the privileged class , '' editorial , sept. 20 -rrb- , you 're reading the headline but not the story . the plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria . but that does n't mean 0 `` half of the students attending berkeley '' will be admitted this way . the plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll . since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class . in addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category . but against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , english-language proficiency and an essay . this category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants . the plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria . who will take over these places ? the plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them about 10 % of the class . one of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race . perhaps it does . but the new category does not replace or reduce berkeley 's broad racial preferences . nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their group . the plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race . the role of academic criteria in choosing berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result . stephen r. barnett professor of law university of california berkeley , calif .
