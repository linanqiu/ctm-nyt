ironically , american airlines ' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry -lrb- sept. 20 -rrb- . you quote robert crandall , chairman of american 's parent , amr corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to detroit because you have to go to detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . '' even if mr. crandall is correct , he of all people must realize 0 our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level . in 1986 , he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to braniff 's president that they both raise fares 20 % . -lrb- braniff declined -rrb- . when i asked american airlines for its side of the story for use in my mba class , where i teach business ethics , it did not respond . perhaps the ethics of an industry 's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry . arnold celnicker assistant professor ohio state university
