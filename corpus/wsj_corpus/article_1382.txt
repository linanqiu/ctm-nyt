growth is good . at least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains 0 they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers . they are starting to buy growth stocks . remember them ? the upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin . that sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years . the current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones . those are unwelcome trends in a year that the dow jones industrial average has risen 23 % so far , even with the 190.58-point plunge on oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood . the question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains . that 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks . `` i think 0 it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , '' says steven einhorn , partner at goldman sachs . growth stocks may be as big as philip morris or medium-sized such as circuit city stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say 0 . `` the period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says stephen boesel , president of t. rowe price 's growth and income fund . growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading . this kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds john calverley , senior economist for american express bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty 50 . '' and they will again , say 0 money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme . cabanne smith , president of a money management company bearing his name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further . he also thinks 0 foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices . `` we 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' mr. smith says . mr. smith recommends cypress semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate . ronald sloan , executive vice president of siebel capital management , likes wellman inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting . mr. sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years . wellman stock closed friday at 39 3\/8 , up 1\/8 ; mr. sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60 . others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks . carmine grigoli , chief market strategist for first boston , who still says , `` we expect the dow average -lcb- to be at -rcb- 3000 by mid-1990 , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime . he recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as philip morris , pepsico , cpc international , reebok international , and limited inc . all have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year . some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle . `` one of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , '' says 0 mr. boesel of t. rowe price . james wright , chief investment officer for banc one asset management , says , `` we 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . '' he recently trimmed his portfolio of international paper , dow chemical , quantum chemical , international business machines and digital equipment . he is putting money in dress barn , circuit city stores , bruno 's , and rubbermaid . big cyclical companies are using `` all the tricks 0 they can to stabilize earnings , '' says mr. sloan . he cites ibm , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares . `` what they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns internally , '' says mr. sloan . `` when they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock . ibm says 0 it considers its shares a good investment . but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals . growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy . goldman sachs 's mr. einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario . he suggests 0 investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead , as well as growth issues . friday 's market activity stock prices finished about unchanged friday in quiet expiration trading . traders anticipated a
