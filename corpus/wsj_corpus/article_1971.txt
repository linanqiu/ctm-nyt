the federal government should make free , voluntary testing for the aids virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome , the hudson institute recommended 0 . `` by encouraging massive , routine , voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups : those who carry the virus and those who do not , '' the indianapolis research organization said in a new report . the report takes a more alarmed view of aids and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses . it warns that the aids epidemic `` may reduce the rate of growth of the work force , curb productivity gains and slow economic growth . '' it contends that current government policy is failing to stem the aids epidemic because it suggests 0 the use of condoms can make sex `` safe . '' but the report says : 0 `` the only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners , '' and testing is the only way 0 to learn of infection . hudson 's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $ 650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old . in addition , the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive .
