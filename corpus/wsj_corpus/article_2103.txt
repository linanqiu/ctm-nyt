in an attempt to give new momentum to european community plans for a single currency , ec government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the ec 's founding treaty of rome . according to diplomatic sources in brussels , most ec leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in strasbourg , france , on dec. 8 and 9 . the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single ec currency . but the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity . setting a date 0 to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push . french president francois mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last june , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by mrs. thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl . diplomatic sources said 0 mr. kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that west germany is still committed to ec unity .
