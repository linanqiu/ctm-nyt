union carbide corp. said 0 third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business . net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago . sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion the previous year . carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter . but the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on wall street . `` it certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said 0 george krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at oppenheimer & co . in new york stock exchange composite trading , carbide closed at $ 24.50 a share , down 50 cents . prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories . prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze . some producers of polyethylene , figuring 0 the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts . the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective . a carbide spokesman said `` 0 the conditions are right for the increase to hold . '' for the third quarter , operating profit from carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense . operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million . in the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million . the latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses . propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products . that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business . polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits . for the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago . sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
