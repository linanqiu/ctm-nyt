the market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished friday . trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers . stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades . `` the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor martin d. sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . this calamity is `` far from over , '' he says 0 . junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the u.s. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities 0 they could find . but `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says john lonski , an economist at moody 's investors service inc . for example , the price of southland corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by goldman , sachs & co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . but not even goldman would make a market in the securities of southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash . goldman officials declined to comment . junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. , which created its u.s. retailing empire with junk financing . campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale . now , dozens of corporations , including ethan allen , tw services and york international , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money . `` the music has stopped playing , '' says michael harkins , a principal in the investment firm of levy harkins . `` you 've either got a chair or you do n't . '' in friday 's aftermath , says 0 r. douglas carleton , a director of high-yield finance at first boston corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . '' in august , first boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of ohio mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . '' the outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says 0 king penniman , senior vice president at mccarthy , crisanti & maffei , an investment arm of xerox financial services . indeed , a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day friday . in a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year . the bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group . the yield on three-month treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average . `` when you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said maria ramirez , money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc . nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . `` this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says william sullivan , director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. , new york . any sustained credit-easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . robert dow , a partner and portfolio manager at lord , abbett & co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says 0 he does n't `` think 0 there is any fundamental economic rationale -lcb- for the junk bond rout -rcb- . it was herd instinct . '' he adds : `` the junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means 0 the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk . i do n't believe 0 that 's the case , but i believe that people are running scared . there is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in treasurys . '' even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds . for example , a recent $ 375 million offering of petrolane gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed . a $ 550 million offering of turner broadcasting system inc . high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand . first boston estimates that in november and december alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments . `` that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says mr. carleton of first boston . `` i do n't know how people can say 0 the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by turner , '' says raymond minella , co-head of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co . `` when the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions 0 to invest and invest they will . there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well-structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of . '' but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year , casting a pall over much of the junk market . michael mcnamara , director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services , says 0 the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices . `` last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says . `` this year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . and our credit standards have n't changed one iota . '' however , mr. mcnamara said 0 the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers . for the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . `` the market has been weak since '' the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york , says mr. minella of merrill lynch . `` that really affected the market in that people started to ask ` what else is in trouble ? ' '' well before campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever . despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news : -- in june , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , new york-based integrated resources inc. said 0 it ran out of borrowed money . -- in july , southmark corp. , the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law . -- by the end of july , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . -- in august , resorts international inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . -- in september , just as the cash squeeze hit campeau , lomas financial corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities . meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating . moody 's says 0 the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 . in addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the federal deposit insurance corp . `` the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says james grant , editor of grant 's interest rate observer , an early critic of the junk bond market . `` what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest . businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . what we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . '' friday 's market activity prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market . the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. edt at 103 12\/32 , compared with 100 27\/32 thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . the yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82 % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group . the `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market . treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in september . bond prices barely budged until midday . many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the federal reserve , which might repeat its october 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their treasury counterparts . mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in government national mortgage association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . the ginnie mae november 9 % issue ended at 98 25\/32 , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12-year average life assumption . investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . but the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened . and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the tennessee valley authority . despite rumors that the tva 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said 0 they expect 0 the issue will be priced as scheduled . one of the sources said 0 the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . '' municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point . roger lowenstein contributed to this article .
