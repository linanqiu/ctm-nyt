medchem products inc. said 0 a u.s. district court in boston ruled that a challenge by medchem to the validity of a u.s. patent held by pharmacia inc. was `` without merit . '' pharmacia , based in upsala , sweden , had charged in a lawsuit against medchem that medchem 's amvisc product line infringes on the pharmacia patent . the patent is related to hyaluronic acid , a rooster-comb extract used in eye surgery . in its lawsuit , pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction 0 to block medchem from selling the amvisc products . a medchem spokesman said 0 the products contribute about a third of medchem 's sales and 10 % to 20 % of its earnings . in the year ended aug. 31 , 1988 , medchem earned $ 2.9 million , or 72 cents a share , on sales of $ 17.4 million . medchem said 0 the court 's ruling was issued as part of a `` first-phase trial '' in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case . it said 0 it is considering `` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . '' the medical-products company added that it plans to `` assert its other defenses '' against pharmacia 's lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't infringed on pharmacia 's patent . medchem said that the court scheduled a conference for next monday -- to set a date for proceedings on pharmacia 's motion for a preliminary injunction .
