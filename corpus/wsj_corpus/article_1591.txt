what 's in a name ? apparently a lot , according to the british firm of deloitte , haskins & sells . the british firm has begun court proceedings in london to prevent the use of the name `` deloitte '' by deloitte , haskins & sells and touche ross & co. in england and the rest of the world . the british deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of deloitte and touche world-wide and joined coopers & lybrand . john bullock , senior partner of deloitte in the u.k. , said `` the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken lightly . '' mr. bullock said 0 the british firm has used the name `` deloitte '' since 1845 . in the u.s. , deloitte , haskins & sells was known as haskins & sells until 1978 , when it added the `` deloitte '' name of its british affiliate . john c. burton , an accounting professor at columbia university 's graduate school of business , said `` there 's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in england , where accounting predates the u.s. . '' although accountants are n't noted as `` being deeply emotional , they really hold it all in , '' said mr. burton , former chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission . j. michael cook , chairman of deloitte , haskins & sells international , said 0 he believes the legal action by the british firm `` to be without merit .
