international business machines corp. said 0 earnings tumbled 30 % in the third quarter , even a bit further than expected , rendering the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters . the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives , a business that accounts for some 10 % of ibm 's $ 60 billion of annual revenue . ibm , which telegraphed the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term . in addition , ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars . earnings fell to $ 877 million , or $ 1.51 a share , somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ 1.60 a share . that compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion , or $ 2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu ltd. relating to a software dispute . revenue climbed 4.3 % to $ 14.31 billion from $ 13.71 billion . ibm , armonk , n.y. , remained upbeat . the computer giant , whose u.s. results have been dismal for years , noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter , following an increase in the second period . the company said in a statement that `` demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide . we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth . '' securities analysts , however , remained downbeat . `` i think 0 1990 will be another mediocre year , '' said steve milunovich of first boston . jay stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ 9 from $ 9.50 for 1989 and to $ 9.50 from $ 10.35 in 1990 because he decided 0 sales would be even weaker than he had expected . both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a share , which itself was well below the record 0 ibm set in 1984 . mr. stevens said 0 he kept a `` buy\/hold '' recommendation on the stock only because `` all the damage has been done . '' he said 0 the stock has n't traded below 1 1\/2 times book value over the past 10 years , which at the moment computes to a stock price of $ 100 . the stock closed yesterday at $ 103 a share , up just $ 1 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged . analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter . `` a key part of the question is , how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up ? '' said steve cohen at soundview financial group . `` and the input 0 i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while . '' on leasing , bob djurdjevic at annex research said 0 he thinks 0 ibm has hurt itself unnecessarily . he said 0 ibm has priced its leases aggressively , thinking 0 that would help win business . but he said 0 ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer . he said 0 ibm has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases . bob bardagy , executive vice president of marketing at comdisco inc. , a huge leasing firm , said : `` to put it mildly , ibm credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company 0 we have ever seen . '' ibm is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes . but the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which means 0 it is long in the tooth , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own . ibm is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market , and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year . but it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth . the disk drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available . but the as\/400 , ibm 's highly successful minicomputer line , is losing its momentum , and some analysts said 0 sales could even decline in the fourth quarter . in addition , ibm 's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8 % , well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from fujitsu and the stronger dollar . and expenses , up 7.9 % in the quarter , have stayed stubbornly high . in the nine months , ibm earned $ 3.17 billion , or $ 5.43 a share , down 8.4 % from the year-earlier $ 3.46 billion , or $ 5.83 a share . revenue increased 6.5 % to $ 42.25 billion from $ 39.68 billion .
