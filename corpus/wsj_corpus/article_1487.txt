as the sponsor of the `` older americans freedom to work act , '' which would repeal the social security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , i applaud your strong endorsement 0 to repeal this depression-era fossil . for every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , social security recipients lose 50 cents of their social security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . but the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates . imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level 0 she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax . although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 . eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit . repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased social security benefit payments . we now need support from the democrats on the rules committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the reconciliation bill . since all four republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor . the time is now 0 to lift the burdensome social security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors . rep. j. dennis hastert -lrb- r. , ill . -rrb-
