r.h. macy & co. , the closely held department store chain , said in a financial filing friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended july 29 were up 10 % to $ 1.59 billion against $ 1.44 billion a year earlier . comparable store sales for the quarter were up 7.3 % . the net loss for the quarter was $ 43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $ 106 million . the loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for federated department stores inc. , as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations . for the year , sales were up 5.6 % to $ 6.97 billion compared with $ 6.61 billion in fiscal 1988 . sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of i. magnin , bullock 's , and bullocks wilshire . macy acquired those three businesses in may 1988 . on a comparable store basis , including the new acquisitions for both years , sales for fiscal 1989 were up 1.9 % . macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $ 53.7 million compared with a net loss of $ 188.2 million for fiscal 1988 . the company 's earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation , which bondholders use a measurement of the chain 's ability to pay its existing debt , increased 11 % in fiscal 1989 to $ 926.1 million from $ 833.6 million . the $ 833.6 million figures includes the new acquisitions . excluding those businesses , earnings before interest , taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $ 728.5 million . as of feb. 1 , 1990 , the bullocks wilshire stores will operate as i. magnin stores . altogether , macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide . although management led a leveraged buy-out of r.h. macy in july 1986 , the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt . the company estimates its total debt at about $ 5.2 billion . this includes $ 4.6 billion of long-term debt , $ 457.5 million in short-term debt , and $ 95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt . in a letter to investors , chairman edward s. finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to `` benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors . while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes , we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise 0 our customers need and want . '' mr. finkelstein is apparently referring to b. altman and bonwit teller , two new york retailers that have recently filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled campeau corp . those chains include bloomingdale 's , which campeau recently said 0 it will sell . other retail properties for sale include saks fifth avenue and marshall field , retailers now owned by b.a.t plc , the british tobacco conglomerate . in his letter , mr. finkelstein also referred to the recent san francisco earthquake . mr. finkelstein flew to san francisco the day after the earthquake , and found that 10 to 12 of his company 's stores had sustained some damage , including the breakage of most windows at the i. magnin store on union square . `` the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive , but looking at the whole fiscal year , we do n't see the effect as material , '' wrote mr. finkelstein .
