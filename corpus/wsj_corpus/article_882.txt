the sept. 25 `` tracking travel '' column advises readers to `` charge with caution when traveling abroad '' because credit-card companies charge 1 % to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars . in fact , this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad . in contrast to the 1 % conversion fee charged by visa , foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7 % or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency . on top of this , the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion . at the end of the trip , any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars , with another commission due . the card holder will pay the modest 1 % fee only on the amounts actually needed . typically , he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure , and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill . in the meantime , the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1 % during that `` float '' period alone . daniel brigham visa u.s.a. inc .
