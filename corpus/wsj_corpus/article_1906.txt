arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of ual corp. stock . look at what happened to ual 's chairman , stephen m. wolf , and its chief financial officer , john c. pope . on a day 0 some united airlines employees wanted mr. wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp , messrs. wolf and pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of ual , united 's parent company , dived $ 24.875 on the big board to close at $ 198 . including monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of ual gone through at $ 300 a share . when bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week , so did ual 's stock . even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $ 250 a share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less than 0 they stood to gain in the initial transaction . mr. wolf owns 75,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each . in the $ 300-a-share buyout , that totaled about $ 76.7 million . by yesterday 's close of trading , it was good for a paltry $ 43.5 million . of course , mr. wolf , 48 years old , has some savings . he left his last two jobs at republic airlines and flying tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $ 22 million , and ual gave him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him . his 1988 salary was $ 575,000 , with a $ 575,000 bonus . the 40-year old mr. pope has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money . united paid him a $ 375,000 bonus to lure him away from american airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ 342,122 last year with a $ 280,000 bonus . mr. pope owns 10,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each . that came to a combined $ 37.7 million under the $ 300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close . of the combined $ 114.4 million 0 the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $ 15 million , angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success . united 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , lifetime access to the friendly skies -- free first-class travel , and $ 20,000 a year for life as well . conceivably , in a scaled-back buy-out , they could be bumped back to coach seats for life .
