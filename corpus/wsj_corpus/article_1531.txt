westmoreland coal co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results . the producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said 0 net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million . for the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share . in the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03 a share . last year 's net loss of $ 3,524,000 included a benefit of $ 1,640,000 from an accounting change . revenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million . in an interview , pemberton hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest . in the latest nine months , mr. hutchinson said 0 , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier . in addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since jan. 1 . he predicted 0 the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters . westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the appalachia region . the operating territory includes coal terminals on the ohio river and in newport news , va . westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas . for the past couple of years , westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business . marginal operations and assets have been sold . the size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . about 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated . even perks have been reduced . for example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % . `` i think 0 the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' mr. hutchinson said of the restructuring program . `` much of what we set out to do is completed . '' but he cautioned that westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume 0 the same rate of improvement can be sustained . one difference , he said 0 , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season . `` i do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said . `` we have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient . it 's a process that never really ends . '' nevertheless , mr. hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . '' for all of 1988 , the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ 134,000 on revenue of $ 593.5 million . an accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share . in a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its westmoreland energy inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in virginia . some of the coal 0 the plants buy will come from westmoreland mines . mr. hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' he said 0 westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the mississippi river . westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . `` we see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' mr. hutchinson said . `` coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think 0 .
