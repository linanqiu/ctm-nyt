the recent bids for united and american airlines have led congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements . the house is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block , for up to 50 days , any bid for 15 % or more of a u.s. airline , even a straight cash purchase . transportation secretary sam skinner , who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in u.s. carriers , now says 0 the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets . texas rep. steve bartlett , who has 40,000 american airlines workers in his district , says 0 the bill is `` good politics , but bad law . '' it is ironic that at a time when america 's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from new zealand to ethiopia , so many in congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline , aeroflot .
