the bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that tw services , a group of restaurant chains , became the latest prospective issuer 0 to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers . the good news -- to fans of stable credit , at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers . apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk . coniston partners , which with related entities controls 80 % of tw , had been planning to sell $ 1.15 billion of junk bonds , among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares . but coniston , a new york partnership managed by the firm of gollust , tierney & oliver , yesterday announced that `` in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets '' the offering would be postponed and restructured . what was n't mentioned is that coniston and its investment banker , donaldson , lufkin & jenrette , just completed a two-week `` road show '' for the purpose of marketing the bonds . and investors , at least for now , took a pass . tw 's junk bonds were n't , as junk bonds go , unusually weak . its fast-food restaurants -- including denny 's , hardee 's , quincy 's and el pollo loco -lrb- `` the only significant fast-food chain 0 to specialize in char-broiled chicken '' -rrb- -- are stable , recession-resistant and growing . but unless they continued to grow , tw , based in paramus , n.j. , would have run into trouble . until recently , such buy-now , pray-for-growth-later deals were routine . `` but people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore , '' says jack utter , who manages the high-yield fund of ids financial services . `` investors , '' he adds , `` are getting religion . '' the tw buy-out may yet be financed . `` there is nothing wrong with the company , '' says coniston principal paul tierney . the rub , he says 0 , is that `` the junk market is n't as deep '' as before . tw 's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov. 21 . by then , dlj hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds . gollust , tierney & oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ 120 million in equity 0 it had planned on . banks may contribute more senior debt . and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced . a dlj banker , putting a best possible face on it , asserts that `` very few people said 0 they did n't like the credit quality . people said 0 they did n't think 0 a billion-dollar deal would trade . '' but trading risk stems from credit risk . and by adding equity , dlj would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern . indeed , the dlj banker says 0 , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest `` will meaningfully improve . '' as he sums it up : `` we are listening to the market . '' what is it , to borrow a term from coniston , that so unsettled the market ? some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings . the tw prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier , pretax earnings `` would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges , including interest on debt securities , '' by approximately $ 62.7 million in the first six months of 1989 . tw notes , as many junk issuers do , that `` adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges '' tw would have run a cash surplus -- in this case , of $ 56 million over six months . but such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation , taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers , deterioration of stores and the like . in fact , dlj says 0 , the company envisions capital expenses of about $ 180 million a year . tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn . but they wo n't necessarily eat at denny 's . the fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes 0 wertheim schroder analyst john rohs . prospective bond buyers noted that tw historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . `` we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also 0 to pay down debt , '' says a big investor in high-yield debt . dlj argues that tw could , if necessary , cut capital spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather than maintenance . but investors noted that under the shelved offering , tw would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments . its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ 52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred , or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid . the prospectus notes 0 `` there can be no assurance '' that future growth will continue at past levels . in the recent past , bond buyers did n't seek such assurance . now , apparently , they do . tw services -lrb- nyse ; symbol : tw -rrb- business : restaurants year ended dec. 31 , 1988 \* revenue : $ 3.57 billion net income : $ 66.9 million ; $ 1.36 a share \*\* third quarter , sept. 30 , 1989 : -lrb- net loss : 7 cents share -rrb- vs. net income : 51 cents a share average daily trading volume : 179,032 shares common shares outstanding : 49 million \* includes results of denny 's inc. , acquired in september \*\* includes $ 9 million write-down of assets and takeover defense costs .
