american telephone & telegraph co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes 0 will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year . at&t also said 0 net income rose 19 % in the third quarter . at&t said 0 its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments . at&t said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program . at&t said 0 third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets . net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million , or 55 cents a share . revenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion . the latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment . the results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by at&t increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts . sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % . but the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products . under the amended pension program , at&t managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes . managers who retire dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier . an at&t spokeswoman said 0 the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees . analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said 0 had been the subject of rumors for several months . `` this tells you 0 at&t is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said jack grubman , an analyst with painewebber inc . but other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth . `` this is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said joel d. gross , an analyst with donaldson , lufkin & jenrette . mr. gross said 0 he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase 0 at&t has told analysts 0 it expects in the future . at&t said 0 the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses . but the company said 0 the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire . at&t said 0 the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in ing . c. olivetti & co. for shares in cie . industriali riunite , an italian holding company . for the nine months , at&t said 0 net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85 a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56 a share . revenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion . in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange , at&t shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents .
