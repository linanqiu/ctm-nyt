missouri farmer blake hurst writing in the fall issue of the heritage foundation 's policy review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county : of course i 'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator . but i 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms 0 i 've seen -lrb- and smelt -rrb- in these parts . an incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door -- on our farm there are four unoccupied houses . on my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning , i drive by another four empty houses . a community of abandoned farmsteads , failing businesses , and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one ... . the loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural missouri is hardly of national importance except for this : if the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in atchinson county , what hope have we for dealing with the wastes 0 our economy produces ? after all , farmers here work with `` hazardous '' chemicals every day , many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator . we know 0 they are dangerous , but if handled with care , their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
