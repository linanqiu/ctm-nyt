the nuclear regulatory commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the seabrook , n.h. , nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license . massachusetts attorney general james shannon , opposing the license , said 0 he will appeal the ruling in federal court . seabrook officials said 0 the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year . the nrc rejected mr. shannon 's argument that public service co. of new hampshire , which owns the largest share of seabrook , and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant 's safe operation . mr. shannon was seeking a waiver of nrc policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions . in its ruling , the nrc said that because seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs , consideration of the owners ' financial condition is pointless . `` the commissioners found 0 the circumstances of the case did n't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation , '' said a commission spokesman . in january 1988 , the utility filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors ' lawsuits .
