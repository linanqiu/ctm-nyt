rjr nabisco inc. said 0 it agreed to sell its baby ruth , butterfinger and pearson candy businesses to nestle s.a. 's nestle foods unit for $ 370 million . the sale , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds 0 to pay debt and boosts nestle 's 7 % share of the u.s. candy market to about 12 % . the candy businesses had sales of about $ 154 million last year , which was roughly 12 % of total revenue for rjr 's planters lifesavers unit , according to a memorandum distributed by rjr 's owner , kohlberg kravis roberts & co. , to bankers last december . the nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in franklin park , ill. , which employs about 800 workers . the sale , which had been expected , is part of kkr 's program 0 to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by february . roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and rjr expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its del monte unit . that sale , however , could still fall through if financing problems develop . thus , it remains crucial for rjr to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands . louis gerstner jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of new york-based rjr , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture . '' since kkr bought rjr in february for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of rjr assets . rjr 's executives have said 0 they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't leaders in their markets . `` rjr nabisco and planters lifesavers will concentrate more on our own core businesses , '' mr. gerstner said friday . baby ruth and butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the u.s. , but rjr 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % . nestle 's share of 7 % before friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders hershey foods corp. and mars inc. , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively . `` this means 0 nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way , '' said lisbeth echeandia , publisher of orlando , fla.-based confectioner magazine . `` for them , it makes all kinds of sense . they 've been given a mandate from switzerland '' to expand their u.s. chocolate operations . nestle s.a. is based in vevey , switzerland . the new candy bars , `` make an important contribution to our nestle foods commitment to this very important strategic unit , '' said 0 c. alan macdonald , president of nestle foods in purchase , n.y .
