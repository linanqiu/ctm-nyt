earlier this year , president bush made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum wage : an increase to $ 4.25 an hour over three years , and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job . now , the white house has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years . the sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days . the white house had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation . the only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers 0 everyone agrees 0 will be priced out of a job at the $ 4.25 rate 0 congress is likely to approve today . it is compromises such as this that convince washington 's liberals that if they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues .
