once again , your editorial page misstates the law 0 to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions . in an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , michael s. greve informs your readers , `` ... the clean water act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' -lrb- `` congress's environmental buccaneers , '' sept. 18 -rrb- . this statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong . the clean water act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge . it requires that `` discharges of pollutants '' into the `` waters of the united states '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301 . whatever may be the problems with this system , it scarcely reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero discharge . '' perhaps mr. greve was confused by congress 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less . this fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute . thus , you do the public a great disservice when mr. greve suggests , even facetiously , that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water ; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters , from the hairyknuckled knock of the sierra club at their doors . robert j. mcmanus
