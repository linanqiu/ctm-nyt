the market for $ 200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the dow jones industrial average rebounded from friday 's plunge . but the junk recovery , led by the bellwether rjr holdings bonds , was precarious . no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry officials said 0 . on friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues . `` nothing traded on friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' yesterday , said 0 raymond minella , co-head of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co . `` but we had a fairly active day yesterday . '' at drexel burnham lambert inc. , the leading underwriter of junk bonds , `` i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight , '' said 0 david feinman , a junk bond trader . `` now , i feel 0 maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria . '' but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said 0 , `` you could n't buy -lcb- junk bonds -rcb- and you could n't give them away . '' yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings 13 3\/4 % bonds , which initially tumbled three points , or $ 30 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 96 1\/4 before rebounding to 99 3\/4 . bonds issued by kroger , duracell , safeway and american standard also showed big gains , recovering almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday . but traders said 0 the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year . `` liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said mr. minella of merrill . `` the deadbeats are still deadbeats , '' said mr. feinman of drexel . analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors . paul asquith , associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , `` we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 . '' mark bachmann , a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. , confirms that there is `` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market . '' `` junk bonds are a highly stratified market , '' said lewis glucksman , vice chairman of smith barney , harris upham & co . `` there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good . '' analysts at standard & poor 's say 0 junk bond offerings by `` tightly stretched '' issuers seem to be growing . almost $ 8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from sci tv , gillette holdings -lrb- not related to gillette co. -rrb- , interco , seaman furniture , allied stores , federated department stores , national gypsum , m.d.c. holdings , micropolis , leaseway transportation and price communications . `` you could still have some very bad times ahead , '' said mr. bachmann . `` it 's possible to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy . i 'm certainly not comfortable saying 0 we 've seen the bottom . '' but yesterday 's rally among `` good '' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market . many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' mr. minella said 0 , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from friday and early yesterday . in contrast , he says 0 , `` the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday , and the -lcb- government -rcb- bond market lost about half what it gained friday . '' traders said 0 yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month . in addition , mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected . `` sometimes a shakeout is healthy , '' said drexel 's mr. feinman . `` people will learn to be more circumspect . if they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades . i think 0 the market is in good shape .
