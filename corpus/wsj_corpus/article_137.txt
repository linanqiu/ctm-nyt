tokyo stocks edged up wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading . london shares finished moderately higher . at tokyo , the nikkei index of 225 selected issues , which gained 132 points tuesday , added 14.99 points to 35564.43 . in early trading in tokyo thursday , the nikkei index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64 . wednesday 's volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares , in line with tuesday 's 909 million . declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues , 454 to 451 . investors switched trading focus quickly as they did tuesday , reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector , traders said 0 . speculation , on the other hand , sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues , though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue . the development , traders said 0 , showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market 's recent directionless trend . dealers led the market wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts , observers said 0 . institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar . the tokyo stock price index -lrb- topix -rrb- of all issues listed in the first section , which gained 16.05 points tuesday , was down 1.46 points , or 0.05 % , at 2691.19 . the second section index , which added 6.84 points tuesday , was up 5.92 points , or 0.16 % , to close at 3648.82 . volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares , up from 14 million tuesday . akio yamamoto , managing director of nomura investment trust management , said that if the u.s. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5 % , institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying . tokyu group , mitsubishi estate and bridgestone\/firestone , which advanced tuesday , declined on profit-taking . wednesday 's dominant issue was yasuda fire & marine insurance , which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying . it ended the day up 80 yen -lrb- 56 cents -rrb- to 1,880 yen -lrb- $ 13.15 -rrb- . due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the u.s. currency , investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares , which traders called a `` defensive '' action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation . teikoku oil , also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying , advanced 100 yen to 1,460 . showa shell gained 20 to 1,570 and mitsubishi oil rose 50 to 1,500 . sumitomo metal mining fell five yen to 692 and nippon mining added 15 to 960 . among other winners wednesday was nippon shokubai , which was up 80 at 2,410 . marubeni advanced 11 to 890 . london share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on wall street and technical factors affecting demand for london 's blue-chip stocks . the financial times-stock exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1 . it rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading . the index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2 , which was posted within the last half-hour of trading . dealers said 0 most investor interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks , particularly those with limited u.k. exposure . also , several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers . sterling 's firm tone , combined with a steady opening on wall street , also tempted some investors to come back to the market , dealers said 0 . there were concerns early in the day that wall street 's sharp gains on tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal . the ft 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1 . volume was 372.9 million shares , up from 334.5 million on tuesday . dealers said 0 institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market 's recent technical rally might prove fragile . they cited wall street 's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market 's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution . jaguar , a u.k. luxury auto maker being pursued by ford motor and general motors , gained 10 pence -lrb- 16 cents -rrb- a share to close at 879 pence -lrb- $ 13.90 -rrb- . it shed about 7 pence , however , after dealers said 0 the market was disappointed that ford did n't move to tender a bid for control of the company . dealers said 0 the u.k. government 's decision tuesday to waive its protective `` golden share '' in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two u.s. auto giants . but the waiver also was seen as a signal that ford , a major u.k. auto industry employer , was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of jaguar . dealers said 0 that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by ford . b.a.t industries , which is being pursued by sir james goldsmith 's hoylake investments , rose 9 to 753 on speculation that hoylake will sweeten its bid , dealers said 0 . like jaguar , b.a.t also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings . reed international , a u.k. publishing group , gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7 % drop in interim pretax profit . analysts said 0 the fall in pretax profit was due to the group 's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units , and that its remaining businesses are performing well . dealers said 0 the market agreed . stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in ft-se 100 shares included carlton communications , which climbed 32 to 778 . drug companies in the key index also notched gains as market-makers searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the sector 's defensive qualities . wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares . glaxo , the u.k. 's largest pharmaceutical concern , advanced 23 to # 14.13 . stock prices closed higher in stockholm , amsterdam and frankfurt and lower in zurich . paris , brussels , and milan were closed for a holiday . south african gold stocks closed marginally lower . elsewhere , share prices closed higher in singapore , taipei and wellington , were mixed in hong kong , lower in seoul and little changed in sydney . manila markets were closed for a holiday . here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by morgan stanley capital international perspective , geneva . to make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . the percentage change is since year-end .
