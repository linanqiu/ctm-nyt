i was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries . if the whole story were told , it would read something like this : -- during the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` use of proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made . -- the reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings -lrb- and management bonuses -rrb- ; the price , a sea of bad loans . -- for the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy 0 to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the u.s. treasury to underwrite their bad ldc credits . -- the treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -lrb- the brady plan -rrb- . -- the banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital 0 to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along . george a. wiegers
