sears , roebuck & co. signed a contract with bob vila , the former host of the popular public television program `` this old house , '' 0 to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer . the do-it-yourself show , slated to start airing by june 1990 , marks sears 's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products . in recent months , sales of home improvement items have sagged , along with sales of other big ticket durable goods . the show also signals mr. vila 's return as a television celebrity . earlier this year , public television station wgbh in boston fired mr. vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements . with mr. vila as host , `` this old house '' became one of the public broadcasting service 's top 10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the network 's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers . but home depot inc. , an atlanta-based home center chain , objected when mr. vila started doing commercial endorsements for rickel home centers , a new jersey building supply company that competes with home depot in some markets . `` i 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said mr. vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` home again with bob vila . '' in an interview , mr. vila criticized his old show , which is continuing with a new host . `` public tv is in fantasy land , '' he said . `` last season , we did a story that involved spending $ 700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast . '' in the new show , he said 0 , `` we 're going to spend $ 60,000 building a start-up house '' for a young couple . while sears would n't comment on the brouhaha over mr. vila 's commercial endorsements , it appears to be building a fence around mr. vila 's affections . his contract makes him `` exclusive '' spokesman for sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns . ogilvy & mather in chicago , a unit of wpp group plc , will handle the advertising account and syndication . the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of time-life home improvement and repair books . his other agreements to promote products have expired . little matter for mr. vila , who complains that `` public tv never paid me more than $ 40,000 a year . '' he said 0 his compensation under the sears contract is `` a multimillion dollar deal .
