canadian imperial bank of commerce said 0 it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except mexico , resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million canadian dollars -lrb- us$ 255 million -rrb- . don bowder , senior vice president and chief accountant , said 0 the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major canadian bank 0 to set aside provisions covering all its c$ 1.17 billion in non-mexican ldc debt . `` it eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said . the bank said 0 about c$ 525 million will be added to its existing ldc and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending oct. 31 . mr. bowder said 0 the c$ 300 million charge to earnings would amount to about c$ 1.34 a share . the bank 's net income for the nine months ended july 31 was c$ 577 million , or c$ 3.10 a share . mr. bowder said 0 the bank will restructure its c$ 604 million of mexican debt , of which c$ 255 million is in mexican notes secured by u.s. government bonds . the bank has a 45 % reserve against the remaining c$ 349 million of mexican debt and expects to swap that for other mexican notes supported by u.s. treasury zero-coupon bonds . mr. bowder said 0 the bank 's experience with ldc debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning , debt sales and debt swaps . he said 0 the bank will no longer participate in ldc sovereign lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank 's standards .
