the head of the nation 's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots . in an open letter that will run today in the trade journal automotive news , ron tonkin , president of the national car dealers association , says 0 dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable . mr. tonkin , who has been feuding with the big three since he took office earlier this year , said that with half of the nation 's dealers losing money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . '' u.s. car dealers had an average of 59 days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of september , according to ward 's automotive reports . but mr. tonkin said 0 dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory . his message is getting a chilly reception in detroit , where the big three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders . even before mr. tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers said 0 they were cutting inventories . ford motor co. and chrysler corp. representatives criticized mr. tonkin 's plan as unworkable . it `` is going to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a chrysler spokesman said .
