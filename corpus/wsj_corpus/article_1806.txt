britain 's monopolies and mergers commission wednesday cleared rhone-poulenc s.a. 's purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from monsanto co. , saying 0 the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on u.k. industrial consumers . the commission , which was asked to study the deal by the department of trade and industry after its announcement in february , said 0 the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant u.k. market share 0 rhone-poulenc would gain through the acquisition . the french chemical giant would hold an 80 % share of the u.k. market for salicylic acid , methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin . the commission found that if the british government attempted to block the merger , rhone-poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant 0 monsanto operates in wales , removing the matter from u.k. jurisdiction .
