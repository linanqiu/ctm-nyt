on the hungry streets of naguib mahfouz 's cairo , life is nasty , brutish and wickedly entertaining . zaita the `` cripple-maker '' rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars -- and takes a cut of every cent 0 they cadge . hassan kamel ali is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed : `` i live in this world , assuming that there is no morality , god or police . '' for the killer and thief , said mahran , fame flows from the barrel of a gun . `` one man said 0 you act as a stimulant , '' a prostitute tells him , `` a diversion to relieve people 's boredom . '' mr. mahfouz 's cairo also has sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to god , not crime , for their salvation . but it is his portrait of cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts , of streets filled with `` dust , vegetable litter , and animal dung '' -- that made his reputation , and won him the nobel prize in 1988 . three novels , `` the beginning and the end '' -lrb- 412 pages , $ 19.95 -rrb- , `` the thief and the dogs '' -lrb- 158 pages , $ 16.95 -rrb- , and `` wedding song '' -lrb- 174 pages , $ 16.95 -rrb- , recently published by doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old mr. mahfouz 's talent . but they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism , protest and allegory . they also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime , from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a third world slum choking on its own refuse . `` soon it 'll be so crowded , '' a narrator complains , `` that people will start eating each other . '' `` the beginning and the end , '' easily the best of the three , belongs to mr. mahfouz 's `` realistic '' period and it is the one for which he is most renowned . published in 1949 , it follows the decline of a cairo family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to dickens , balzac and galsworthy . a minor bureaucrat dies suddenly , dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace . his daughter turns to dressmaking , then to peddling herself for a few piasters . one son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed , while another helps support the family with money siphoned from crime . the real tragedy , though , lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances . mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper 's grave . the family moves to another house at night to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors . and the successful son wishes his embarrassing siblings dead . as a critique of middle-class mores , the story is heavy-handed . but its unsentimental sketches of cairo life are vintage mahfouz . we see , smell and hear slums filled with `` the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language , rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street . '' and we meet engaging crooks , such as hassan `` the head , '' famed for his head-butting fights , his whoring and his hashish . `` ` god has not yet ordained that i should have earnings , ' he tells his worried mother . '' hassan comes to a bad end , but so does almost everyone else in the book . if the setting is exotic , the prose is closer to balzac 's `` pere goriot '' than it is to `` arabian nights . '' mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in arabic , and he modeled his work on western classics . in one sense , this limits him ; unlike a writer such as gabriel garcia marquez , who has a distinctive latin voice , mr. mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled `` egyptian . '' but the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the streets of cairo come alive for the western reader as vividly as dickens 's london or dostoevski 's st. petersburg . `` the thief and the dogs , '' written in 1961 , is a taut , psychological drama , reminiscent of `` crime and punishment . '' its antihero , said mahran , is an egyptian raskolnikov who seeks nobility in robbing and killing . `` i am the hope and the dream , the redemption of cowards , '' he says in one of many interior monologues . later , he recalls the words of his marxist mentor : `` the people ! theft ! the holy fire ! '' said 's story reflects the souring of socialism under nasser , whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952 . by 1961 , mr. mahfouz 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in said . his giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real robbers '' -- the rich `` dogs '' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents , and eventually to his own . cairo 's spirited squalor also has gone gray . here , the city is dark and laden with symbolism : said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of cairo society . while the theme is compelling , the plot and characters are not . we never care about said or the `` hypocrites '' 0 he hunts . `` the thief and the dogs '' is a pioneering work , the first stream-of-consciousness novel in arabic , but it is likely to disappoint western readers . the 1981 novel `` wedding song '' also is experimental , and another badly aimed bullet . the story of a playwright 's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues , in the manner of faulkner 's `` the sound and the fury . '' but the device obscures more than it illuminates . buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art , and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world . but again , the themes get tangled in mr. mahfouz 's elliptical storytelling . the indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the arab world . mr. mahfouz has been pilloried and censored for questioning islam and advocating peace with israel . veiling his message has helped him endure . art , says 0 the playwright in `` wedding song , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take . '' `` wedding song '' gives glimpses of a cairo that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once said , `` the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty . '' the clutter of the 1940s remains , but its color has drained away , and the will to overcome has been defeated . cars ca n't move because of overflowing sewers . characters complain ceaselessly about food queues , prices and corruption . and the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who gripes : `` only government ministers can afford it these days ! '' having lost their faith in god , in social reform and in opium , cairenes are left with nothing but their sense of humor . mr. horwitz is a journal staff reporter covering the middle east .
