american enterprise institute scholar norman ornstein in the oct. 21 tv guide on `` what tv news does n't report about congress -- and should '' : by concentrating all their resources on the pay raise , wright and tower , the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution ... . an imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how congress really works -- and why voters in , say , west virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in arkansas did not . but nobody did such a piece , reflecting a contemporary axiom : the more a scandal has to do with a congressman 's duties as a congressman , the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network . ethicist michael josephson , in one of his institute 's recent publications on `` journalism : in the year 2000 '' : the operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal , sensitive and intimate facts . traditional standards of relevancy and importance -lrb- `` is this something 0 the public ought to know '' -rrb- will be replaced by a much broader test -lrb- `` is this something 0 the public is interested in knowing '' -rrb- . and , since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism , reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships , activities of family members , and all matters about mental and physical health . similarly , visual images will be more vivid , sensational and , sometimes , gruesome . one consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse 0 to arouse an already cynical public to control the press .
