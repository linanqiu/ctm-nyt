nissan motor co. expects net income to reach 120 billion yen -lrb- u.s. $ 857 million -rrb- in its current fiscal year , up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year , yutaka kume , president , said 0 . mr. kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990 , ending next march 31 , in an interview with u.s. automotive writers attending the tokyo motor show . the executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations . during the next decade , mr. kume said 0 , nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside japan . last year , mr. kume said 0 , nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles , and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in north america , europe and australia . but by 1992 , he added 0 , nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside japan , or sufficient to equal exports . `` by the end of the 1990s , '' he said , `` we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from japan . '' that will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity , he acknowledged 0 , but did n't provide specific details .
