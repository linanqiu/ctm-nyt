dow chemical co. said 0 third-quarter net income slipped 6.8 % from a record year-ago quarter . the decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which dow posted earnings increases . dow 's third-quarter net fell to $ 589 million , or $ 3.29 a share , from $ 632 million , or $ 3.36 a share , a year ago . sales in the latest quarter rose 2 % to $ 4.25 billion from $ 4.15 billion a year earlier . dow closed at $ 94.625 a share , up 75 cents , in new york stock exchange composite trading . a spokeswoman said 0 dow is comfortable with wall street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $ 14.60 a share , compared with last year 's record net of $ 2.4 billion , or $ 12.76 a share . but that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ 3.44 a share , or $ 635 million . dow would earn $ 14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance . dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $ 15 a share this year even before they announced in july a plan to acquire 67 % of marion laboratories inc . that acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year , the company spokeswoman said 0 . dow has n't said exactly what impact the marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings . dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors , including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals , a slower u.s. economy and a stronger dollar , which made dow 's exports from the u.s. more expensive to overseas customers . another problem was a 7 % increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2 % . for the first nine months of the year , dow earned $ 2.06 billion , or $ 11.41 a share , up 17 % from $ 1.76 billion , or $ 9.32 a share , a year ago . sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7 % to $ 13.34 billion from $ 12.38 billion in the year-ago period .
