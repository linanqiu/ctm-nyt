and you thought 0 the only reason 0 to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an irs audit . reggie jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . mr. jackson , who won the nickname `` mr. october '' for his world series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each . dealers say 0 the budding trade in mr. jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . `` i do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says jack smalling , a dealer in ames , iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . an initial batch of mr. jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in san francisco over labor day weekend . mr. jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well . `` for someone who has everything else -- reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says william vizas , owner of bill 's sports collectibles in denver , who examined the checks at the san francisco card show . for years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold . but these players were dead . `` maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -lcb- ty -rcb- cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were babe ruth checks , '' says mr. smalling . however , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . `` maybe i 'm a little stuffy , but i would n't sell them , '' sniffs bob machon , owner of papa 's sports cards in menlo park , calif . `` who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' and mr. smalling does n't believe 0 they 're worth all that much now . `` i do n't think 0 the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he says . why mr. jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . he probably has n't done it for the cash . `` i would say 0 he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says matt merola , an agent of mr. jackson 's based in new york . `` he has good investments . '' and mr. jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too . or at least he should . `` i assume 0 those accounts are closed , '' says mr. smalling , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks . `` i do n't think 0 he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
