eaton corp. had a 26 % drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business . sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said 0 stephen r. hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer . he declined to make a specific earnings estimate . third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago . sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million . the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in september from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said 0 patrick e. sheridan , analyst with mcdonald & co . mr. sheridan , who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ 1.25 a share , says 0 he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10 . eli lustgarten of painewebber inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says 0 he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report . he said 0 eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated . eaton said 0 sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million . sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose . eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million . mr. hardis said 0 truck-fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves . the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said 0 , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral . operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million . the company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in north america and in the european appliance-controls market . for the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago . eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier . nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier . in new york stock exchange composite trading , eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 .
