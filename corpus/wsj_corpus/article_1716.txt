without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses , the economic and structural damage by hurricane hugo in south carolina would have been much less , as highlighted by your oct. 3 editorial `` subsidizing disaster . '' congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit isle of palms near charleston . as you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the coastal barrier resource system . the national taxpayers union would like congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` the coastal barrier improvement act of 1989 . '' this bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support . private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development . however , home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction . a taxpayers union study concluded 0 the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years . already , the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $ 800 million . marshall y. taylor communications director national taxpayers union
