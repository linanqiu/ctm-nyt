xerox corp. has told employees in its crum & forster personal insurance operations that it is laying off about 300 people , or 25 % of the staff . a spokeswoman for crum & forster said 0 employees were told early this week that numerous staff functions for the personal insurance lines were going to be centralized as a cost-cutting move . she said 0 the move would result in a after-tax charge of less than $ 4 million 0 to be spread over the next three quarters . by comparison , for the first nine months , xerox earned $ 492 million , or $ 4.55 a share , on revenue of $ 12.97 billion . earnings at xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly , but that was largely because capital gains at crum & forster offset hurricane hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments . property\/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters , as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as hurricane hugo and the california earthquake have resulted in huge payments .
