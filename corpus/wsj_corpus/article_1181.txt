housing and urban development secretary jack kemp called on the federal reserve system to lower interest rates . in a speech to the mortgage bankers association , mr. kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' `` i am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in america , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the third world economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' mr. kemp said . the fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % . bush administration officials say 0 inflation is under control . with economic growth slowing , they say 0 they believe 0 the fed should ease credit even further . but for the most part , officials have avoided expressing those views in public , fearing 0 they would unnecessarily antagonize the fed .
