while welcoming nicholas mcinnes 's sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your `` world-wide tax revolution '' table -lrb- editorial page , aug. 29 -rrb- , i am surprised that he neglected other errors that , for some of us , strike close to home . as a channel islander , i was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of `` 86 countries with an income tax . '' despite a history of heated local debate on the topic , my passport clearly reads `` british citizen . '' whether mr. mcinnes 's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander 's benign neglect is a question 0 my fellow channel islanders -lrb- and friends on the isle of man -rrb- will continue to ponder . patrick basham
