'' qintex australia is a unit of qintex ltd . the qintex group 's problems began in earnest in march , when mr. skase agreed to buy mgm\/ua communications co . but the transaction faltered in september , when qintex australia was forced to increase its offer to us$ 1.5 billion following a counterbid from rupert murdoch ; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month . qintex australia owes creditors around a$ 1.2 billion . last friday , qintex entertainment inc. , its 43%-owned u.s. tv production and distribution affiliate , filed for chapter 11 protection .
