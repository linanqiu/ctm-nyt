bankamerica corp. reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan losses . for the quarter , bankamerica said 0 it earned $ 254 million , or $ 1.16 a share , compared with $ 190 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier . bankamerica spokesmen said 0 preliminary reports indicate 0 the company was n't materially affected by the tuesday earthquake . all but eight of the 850 branches , which had some structural damage , reopened yesterday for business . automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday , a bank spokesman said 0 . for the first time in nearly two years , bankamerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters , but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors . third-quarter profit was 16 % below the $ 304 million , or $ 1.50 a share , earned in the 1989 second quarter . the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter , totaling $ 63 million , compared with $ 28 million in the third quarter . excluding tax credits , profit was 6 % below the second quarter . but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid , to $ 5 million from $ 54 million the second quarter . moreover , bankamerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ 170 million , about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ 100 million in the year-earlier quarter . the provision rate was far above bankamerica 's actual net credit losses of $ 24 million in the third quarter , compared with $ 18 million in the second period and $ 38 million a year earlier . as a result , bankamerica said 0 its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans , once below 25 % , now amounts to 45 % of the $ 6.4 billion of non-trade debt 0 it calculates 0 it is owed by those nations . that level is about the same as some other big banks , but far below the 85 % and 100 % reserves of bankers trust new york corp. and j.p. morgan & co. , respectively . by any measure , third-quarter earnings were still robust , equivalent to a 0.92 % return on assets even excluding tax credits . by that key measure of operating efficiency , bankamerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded los angeles-based competitor , security pacific corp. , which posted a 0.89 % return in the third quarter . but it continued to badly trail its san francisco neighbor , wells fargo & co. , which reported an extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets . both returns do n't include any tax credits . `` they -lcb- bankamerica -rcb- continue to show good performance , '' said donald k. crowley , an analyst with keefe , bruyette & woods inc. , san francisco . in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange , bankamerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $ 32 a share . shareholder equity improved to 4.68 % from 4.23 % in the previous quarter . the 4.52 % net interest margin , or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate 0 it pays for deposits and other borrowings , was still markedly higher than the 3.91 % ratio a year earlier , and is among the best in the industry , analysts said 0 . the high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans , which jumped 31 % to $ 17.47 billion from a year earlier , and residential mortgages , which rose 25 % to $ 12 billion . bankamerica 's total loans rose 8 % to $ 71.36 billion . for the nine months , bankamerica profit soared 81 % to $ 833 million , or $ 4.07 a share , from $ 461 million , or $ 2.40 a share .
