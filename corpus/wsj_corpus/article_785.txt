an enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : he has made speaking filipino respectable . the 6 1\/2-foot-tall turtle , pong pagong , is a character who stars in the children 's television show `` batibot . '' he speaks only in filipino . `` batibot , '' which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the u.s. program `` sesame street , '' has developed into a distinctly philippine effort . radio programs and books have followed the daily television show . in the process , `` batibot , '' an archaic filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language . `` it impresses on ordinary , young filipinos that there 's nothing 0 to feel inferior about in using their own language , '' says randy david , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show . `` when we started the program six years ago , the use of filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says lydia brown , the program 's creator . now , she says 0 , `` it 's no longer an issue . '' the success of `` batibot '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language . filipino -- once known as pilipino -- is predominantly tagalog , the malay-based language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of luzon . resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer english . but while better-off filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english , they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against filipino , say 0 advocates of the native language . `` for the middle and upper-middle class -lcb- filipino -rcb- is declasse , '' says bien lumbera , a philippine-studies professor at quezon city 's university of the philippines . there 's also resentment . other opponents of filipino come from non-tagalog regions . they argue that their own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more than any other language . -lrb- there are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country . -rrb- what tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines . it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. , in philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography . as they did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. , teachers for the most part teach in english , even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children . as a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school . mrs. brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to filipino a `` language schizophrenia . '' the issue has been simmering for years . it does n't take much to provoke an intense debate . when president corazon aquino , whose command of filipino is spotty , announced last year that the language would be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many legislators , who continue to conduct debates mostly in english . but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling . they believe the media , including `` batibot , '' have played a crucial role . according to chief scriptwriter rene villanueva , `` batibot '' does n't set out to advance the cause of filipino . `` it 's not as if we 're teaching language per se , '' he says , `` we 're just using it . '' these days , `` batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment . it is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks . with an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs . but advertising revenue is inadequate . periodically , there are threats that the program will fold . `` batibot '' lacks the polish of `` sesame street . '' sound stages echo . acting sometimes falls flat . there are only two large puppets in the program : pong pagong and a monkey named kiko matsing . but the production is the equal of any local program . and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies . the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment . not that the language war is won , even on `` batibot . '' during one recent episode , all the advertisements were in english .
