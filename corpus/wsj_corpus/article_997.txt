christopher cox 's oct. 13 editorial-page article `` toward more crippling lawsuits ... '' misses the point . the 1989 americans with disabilities act is about eliminating discriminatory barriers . when we look closely at our own history , it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments . this is how american women won the right to vote . and it is how african-americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation . for the more than 43 million americans with disabilities , the 1989 americans with disabilities act provides the missing piece . disabled americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 rehabilitation act . the 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector . those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the rehabilitation act . without legal recourse , there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone . john r. garrison president national easter seal society
