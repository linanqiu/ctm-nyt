the city 's department of consumer affairs charged newmark & lewis inc. with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices . in a civil suit commenced in state supreme court in new york , the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have `` lowered every price on every item '' as part of an advertising campaign that began june 1 . the agency said 0 it monitored newmark & lewis 's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign , and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same . in late may , newmark & lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5 % to 20 % and eliminate what it called a `` standard discount-retailing practice '' of negotiating individual deals with customers . the consumer agency also disputed newmark & lewis 's continuing strategy of advertising `` new lower prices '' when allgedly there have n't been price reductions since june 1 . richard d. lewis , president of the 47-store chain , defended the company 's pricing campaign , saying 0 it did n't use `` the misleading expression ` reduced from original prices . ' '' mr. lewis said 0 the company marked price tags and advertised at its `` lowest possible prices '' for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion . mr. lewis said 0 the company gave the consumer affairs department `` volumes of documents '' to substantiate its statements , and made `` every effort to comply '' with all the agency 's policies . in its suit , the consumer agency seeks fines of $ 1,000 per violation of the city 's consumer protection law , costs of investigation , and an injunction 0 to prevent newmark & lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising .
