sotheby 's inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . the new york arm of the london-based auction house auctioned off the estate of john t. dorrance jr. , the campbell 's soup co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . that total was below the $ 140 million 0 the auction house estimated 0 the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement 0 sotheby 's had made with the dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house . sotheby 's provided the dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said 0 , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property 0 to be sold . the dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings . an henri matisse , auctioned last wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist . in addition , a handful of paintings from the dorrance collection remain to be sold at sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in january .
