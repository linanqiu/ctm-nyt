your oct. 6 article `` japan 's financial firms lure science graduates '' states , `` industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing japan 's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees . '' the japanese industrial companies should know better . they are barking up the wrong tree , because it is basically their fault 0 they ca n't attract new employees . takuma yamamoto , president of fujitsu ltd. , believes `` 0 the ` money worship ' among young people ... caused the problem . '' he is just passing the buck to young people . what 's wrong with asking for more money ? money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work . it is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job . unfortunately , japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages . i get the impression that some japanese managers believe 0 working harder for less money is beautiful . i visited a lot of major japanese manufacturers , but i never felt 0 i would want to be employed by any of them . many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing people 's perceptions . if the japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions -lrb- better offices and more vacations , for example -rrb- ; accept and hire more labor from outside japan . hiroshi asada
