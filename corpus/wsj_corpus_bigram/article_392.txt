this city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds_of thousands_of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last_week 's earthquake . estimates of damage in the six-county san_francisco bay_area neared $_5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system . the bay_bridge , the main artery into san_francisco from the east , will_be closed for at_least several_weeks . part_of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the richter_scale . the bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day . also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have_been closed for repairs . the bay_area rapid transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000 . bart has increased service to 24_hours a day in preparation for the onslaught . most unusual will_be water-borne commuters from the east_bay towns of oakland and berkeley . for the first_time in 32 years , ferry service has_been restored between the east_bay and san_francisco . the red and white fleet , which_operates regular commuter ferry service to and from marin county , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering east_bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip . that tariff is too stiff for some financial_district wage earners . ``_i 'll stay with bart , '' said one secretary , swallowing her fears_about using the transbay tube . officials expect the golden_gate bridge to be swamped with an_extra load of commuters , including east_bay residents making a long detour . ``_we 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official . about 23,000 people typically travel over the golden_gate bridge during commute hours . about 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . meetings canceled by apple_computer inc. 's european sales_force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants . it also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters . `` other cities are calling -lcb- groups booked here for tours and conferences -rcb- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said scott shafer , a spokesman for mayor_art agnos . city_officials stuck by their estimate of $_2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city . the other five bay_area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $_2.8 billion . all estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $_1 billion . among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in san_francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage . the most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known_as the embarcadero freeway . until it was closed tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the bay_bridge heading into the financial_district . engineers say_0 it will_take at_least eight_months to repair the embarcadero structure . as_part of the quake recovery effort , the city building department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the financial_district 's high-rises . the preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that ``_we were incredibly lucky , '' said lawrence kornfield , san_francisco 's chief building inspector . while many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural_damage . city building codes require construction that can resist temblors . in england , martin leach , a spokesman for lloyd_'s of london , said_0 the insurance market has n't_yet been_able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster . `` the extent of the claims wo_n't be known for some time , '' mr. leach said . on friday , during a visit to california 0 to survey quake damage , president_bush promised to `` meet the federal_government 's obligation '' to_assist relief efforts . california officials plan to ask congress for $_3 billion or more of federal_aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans . the state has a $_1 billion reserve , and is_expected to add $_1 billion to that fund in the next_year . some of that money will_be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax 0 to raise money for earthquake relief . however , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum . g. christian hill and ken wells contributed_to this_article .
