the economy 's temperature will_be taken from several vantage points this_week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation . the most troublesome report may_be the august merchandise_trade deficit due out tomorrow . the trade_gap is_expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from july 's $_7.6 billion , according_to a survey by mms international , a unit of mcgraw-hill_inc. , new_york . thursday 's report on the september consumer_price index is_expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9_% gain reported friday in the producer_price index . that gain was being cited as a reason 0 the stock_market was down early in friday_'s session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point_plunge . economists are divided as to how_much manufacturing strength they_expect to see in_september reports on industrial_production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . meanwhile , september housing_starts , due wednesday , are thought to have inched upward . `` there 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said_0 michael englund , director of research at mms . a widening of the deficit , if it were combined_with a stubbornly strong_dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted . in any_event , mr. englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade_gap have already been made . `` trade is definitely going_to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven_months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said . exports are thought to have_risen strongly in_august , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said . views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read september 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those_who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations . the wide_range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : the forecasts run from a drop of 0.5_% to an_increase of 0.4_% , according_to mms . a rebound in energy_prices , which helped push up the producer_price index , is_expected to do the same in the consumer_price report . the consensus view expects a 0.4_% increase in the september cpi after a flat reading in_august . robert h. chandross , an_economist for lloyd_'s bank in new_york , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the cpi than in prices at the producer level . `` auto prices had a big effect in the ppi , and at the cpi level they wo_n't , '' he said . food prices are_expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as_much as 4_% , said_0 gary ciminero , economist_at fleet\/norstar financial group . he also says_0 he_thinks 0 `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy_prices , was strong last_month . he_expects a gain of as_much as 0.5_% in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases . housing_starts are_expected to quicken a_bit from august 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units . economists say_0 an august rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an_increase in_september starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .
