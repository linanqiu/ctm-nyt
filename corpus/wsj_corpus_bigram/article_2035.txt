billions of investors_' dollars are pouring out of the nation_'s junk-bond mutual_funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk_market . last_week alone , an eye-popping $_1.6 billion flowed out of the junk_funds , or nearly 5_% of their total_assets , according_to estimates by dalbar financial_services inc. , a boston research_firm . in the past_two months the nation_'s 88 junk_funds have lost a total of about $_6 billion -- more_than 15_% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , dalbar says_0 . it made the estimates based_on data collected from more_than a dozen big junk_funds . interviews with three major fund groups -- fidelity_investments , vanguard_group inc. and t._rowe price associates_inc. -- confirm the trend . their junk_funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $_500 million , or about 13_% of their junk fund assets , in the past_two months . some fund_managers say_0 negative publicity has exacerbated investors_' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices . `` people have_been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` i_ca n't take it anymore -- i_'m getting_out , ' ''_says kurt brouwer of brouwer & janachowski , a san_francisco investment_adviser . the withdrawals could spell trouble for the $_200 billion junk_market . if the heavy outflows continue , fund_managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead . such selling could erode prices of high-yield_junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems . mutual_fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money , says_0 louis harvey , dalbar 's president . mutual_fund officials_say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds . so the impact_on the $ 950 billion mutual_fund industry as a whole probably will_be slight . but tremors are_likely in the junk-bond_market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent_years . mutual_funds are the among the largest holders of junk , accounting for more_than a quarter of the entire high-yield , high-risk market . the 88 mutual_funds investing solely in junk_bonds hold assets of about $_32 billion . other funds hold a smattering of junk_bonds , too . the $_1.5 billion fidelity high income fund has had a net outflow of about $_150 million in the past_two months . about $ 60 million streamed out last_week alone , double the level of the week following last_month 's campeau_corp. credit squeeze . about 98 % of the outflow was transferred to other fidelity funds , says_0 neal litvack , a fidelity vice_president , marketing , with most going into money market funds . `` you_get a news item , it hits , you have strong redemptions that day and for two_days following -- then go_back to normal , ''_says mr. litvack . the fund , with a cash cushion of more_than 10_% , has `` met all the redemptions without_having to sell one_thing , '' mr. litvack says . he_adds : `` our fund has had -lcb- positive -rcb- net sales every month for the last three_years -- until this_month . '' vanguard 's $_1 billion high yield bond portfolio has seen $ 161 million flow out since early september ; $ 14 million of that seeped out friday oct._13 alone . still , two-thirds of the outflow has_been steered into other vanguard portfolios , says_0 brian mattes , a vice_president . the fund now holds a cash_position of about 15_% . at the $ 932 million t._rowe price high yield fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past_two months . those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other t._rowe price funds , followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this_year through august . `` the last two_months have_been the whole ball game , ''_says steven norwitz , a vice_president . junk-fund holders have barely broken even this_year , as fat interest_payments barely managed to offset declining prices . through_oct. 19 , high-yield funds had an_average 0.85 % total_return -lrb- the price change plus dividends on fund shares -rrb- , according_to lipper_analytical services_inc . that 's even less_than the 4.35 % total_return of the merrill_lynch high-yield index . fidelity 's junk fund has_fallen 2.08 % this_year through_oct. 19 , lipper says_0 ; the vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ; and the t._rowe price fund edged_up 0.66 % . people_who remain in junk_funds now could_get hit again , some_analysts and fund specialists say_0 . many funds in recent_weeks and months have_been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such_as rjr_nabisco , to raise_cash to meet expected redemptions . funds might_be forced to accept lower_prices if_they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers . and then , asset_values of the funds could plunge more_than they have so_far . says_michael hirsch , chief investment officer of republic national_bank and manager of the fundtrust group in new_york : `` it 's a time bomb just waiting to go off .
