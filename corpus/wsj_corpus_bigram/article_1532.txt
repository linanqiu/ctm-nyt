prime_minister lee kuan yew , singapore 's leader and one of asia 's leading statesmen for 30_years , recently_announced his intention to retire next_year -- though not_necessarily to end his influence . the prime_minister , whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor , nonetheless continues to display an energy , a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other asian leaders dare say only privately . the 66-year-old mr._lee recently spent an_hour discussing the state of asia and the world with two journal reporters in his plainly furnished , wood-paneled office . the interview did_not touch on singapore 's domestic affairs . skipping personal pleasantries , mr._lee picked_up exactly where he left off several_months earlier -- before the government crackdown in china -- when he had warned_that the orthodox leadership in beijing feared a plurality of views . excerpts follow : on china_'s turmoil : `` it is a very unhappy scene , '' he said . `` it took zhao ziyang -lrb- former premier and party chief -rrb- 10_years to build a team of economists who understood how the western economies work and now that team is part in exile , part being rusticated and part missing . '' rebuilding that team , mr._lee predicted 0 , will_take another 10_years . `` that 's very sad for china and for asia because china could have_been a good engine for growth , not just for hong_kong and taiwan but for japan , korea and the rest of asia . '' on similarities between china and the soviet_union : `` in important particulars , the soviets are different from the chinese . they_are already industrialized ... . their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy . the chinese problem is much greater -- it 's how to industrialize to begin with . '' asked if the soviets , like chinese officials , wo_n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control , mr._lee said , ``_i would think that the soviets face a deeper dilemma because_they have_been more in blinkers than the chinese -- i mean keeping their people cut_off from the outside world . '' mikhail_gorbachev , he said_0 , is ahead of china_'s leaders in his awareness of the world . `` but i_think 0 the soviet peoples are more introverted than the chinese . '' regardless , he said , he still believes_0 the soviet_union , while falling far short of the efficiency of a western economy , may well manage to improve considerably . on asia-pacific prosperity : `` if america can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15_years , with adjustments , and japan can grow and not cut_back , and so too , korea , taiwan , hong_kong , singapore , asean , australia and new_zealand -- then in 15_years , the economies of these_countries would_be totally restructured to be_able to almost sustain growth by themselves . '' in such an arrangement , `` all benefit , '' he said_0 . `` and if the europeans come in , they benefit too . it 's not a zero-sum game . '' asked about the possibility of greater economic_cooperation among asia-pacific nations , which will_be discussed nov._6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in canberra , mr._lee said_0 the goal `` is to have a free and open world trading system . '' an asian bloc is n't intended , he said_0 . `` that 's not possible . '' on u.s.-japan relations : ``_i 'm encouraged . i_think 0 the earlier strident notes struck by -lcb- u.s. commerce secretary robert -rcb- mosbacher and -lcb- u.s._trade representative -rcb- carla_hills have_been more rounded . i_believe 0 the u.s. is becoming_more patient and circumspect , '' he said . `` it 's the total relationship that is important . '' the total relationship , as mr._lee sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the u.s. 0 to fund the deficits , the investments 0 the japanese are making in the u.s. in order to satisfy american demand that american products consumed in america should_be made as_much as possible in america by americans with japanese technology and capital . '' japan 's recent political turbulence , mr._lee said_0 , may mean_0 japan will slow market adjustments . `` they_'ll be more timorous in tackling their_own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from america , hurting their farmers . '' on u.s. military presence in asia : asked if his offer to allow the american military to use facilities in singapore would help preserve america 's presence in the region at bases in the philippines , he said , `` what we have done is make it easier for the philippines to continue to host american bases without it being said_0 they_are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in asia or in southeast_asia . we are willing_to share the political burden of being host to america , an imperial power . we_think 0 it is n't such a great burden , that it carries no stigma , and we are prepared to do it . '' on u.s.-philippine relations : `` it 's such a mixed-up relationship going back_into history ... . i really do not understand how it is that filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they_want to dispose of and yet they need . i just do_n't understand it . my relationships_with the british are totally different . they lorded it over me . they_did me some good . they_did themselves even more good . they let_me down when the japanese came down -lcb- during world_war ii -rcb- ... . i_do n't feel down or done in because i show british serials on my television_network or read their books . i mean_0 it is a normal adult relationship . `` but the filipinos and the americans , when i talk to them , there 's so_much passion about filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the americans and so on . the occasional englishman tries_to put on airs but we let it pass ... . it 's just comic when they try_to pretend 0 they_'re still the master race . '' mr._lee added that the filipinos are `` making it very_difficult '' for the u.s. military presence to last beyond five or 10_years . on military alternatives if the u.s. pulls back : `` the soviets already are present . i suppose 0 sooner_or later , the japanese would_have to fill up a large part_of the gap on the naval side . maybe the chinese , maybe even the indians . '' on economic consequences of a diminished u.s. presence : `` america is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties . '' asked why so few nations seem to share his views of america , he said , `` many_people see it that way . but they have just taken it for granted . '' on cambodia : `` let 's assume that -lcb- former cambodian leader prince norodom -rcb- sihanouk does what the press wants him to do and joins up with -lcb- vietnamese-backed cambodian leader -rcb- hun sen . is the trouble over ? can sihanouk and hun sen knock off the khmer_rouge still supported_by china ? he ca_n't . `` what is the way forward ? to get the khmer_rouge as_part of a process for elections . and when they lose , then we_can expect china to stop aid . let 's put it bluntly . the chinese can_not be seen to have made use of the khmer_rouge and then discard them .
