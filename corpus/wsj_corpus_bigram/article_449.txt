ducks . if the white_house spots one , it_intends to fire a veto at it . ducks are this season 's word for new taxes , under omb director_richard darman 's formulation that `` if it looks_like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck . '' george_bush is quite clear : no new ducks . but what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over washington ? we see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the american economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities . federal child_care -lrb- quack -rrb- . the clean_air bill -lrb- quack -rrb- . the disabled-workers bill -lrb- quack , quack -rrb- . the bush white_house is breeding non-duck ducks the same way_0 the nixon white_house did : it hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child_care . it comes up with a toned-down version of a democratic proposal . the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from . consider , for_instance , the very fat fowl known_as federalized child_care . the president came up with a good bill , but now may end_up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on_capitol hill . it would_create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the department of health and human_services . they_'d determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they_'d regulate the storage facilities . the initial costs are said to be in the $_2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning . new entitlements tend_to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes . quack . the administration claims that its clean_air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist michael evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range . the house bill also distorts economic efficiency in all_sorts of perverse ways . for_example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power_plants . so instead of building more_efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants . the money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology . the bill also imposes the california auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in big sky , montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in los_angeles . proponents of the nationwide standards say_0 the cost for car buyers would_be about $_500 per car . other analysts_say 0 that estimate is low . quack . nobody knows_how many billions of dollars the americans with_disabilities act will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails . it is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation . judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts . lawyers will benefit . private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end_up footing the huge bill . the effect of nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . all this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the reagan_administration to lift this burden from the american people , states and local_governments . running for president in 1980 and 1988 , george_bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s . in fact , during last_year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard mr._bush tout his accomplishments as head of the task_force on regulatory relief . `` government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of american business , '' the vice_president declared when he was head of the task_force . but with the impending passage of these new programs , mr._bush will surely be sending many_people hurtling back_into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut_back . by 1986 , the number_of federal_regulators was down to about 103,000 . then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will_be up to about 109,000 regulators by next_year . holding the dam on taxes is the most_important task of the bush presidency . we would_have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way_0 to slow_down an economy . it is merely the most obvious . what is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire . but while they_are unloading these burdens , the united_states is close to creating three more big ones . the bush_administration ought_to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks .
