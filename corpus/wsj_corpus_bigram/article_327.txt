maidenform inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public . the 67-year-old maker of brassieres , panties , and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images , but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family . `` there_are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group , ''_says robert_a. brawer , 52_years old , recently named_president , succeeding beatrice coleman , his mother-in-law , who remains_chairman . ``_we are a vanishing breed , '' he muses . mrs. coleman , 73 , who declined to be_interviewed , is the maidenform strategist . sales have tripled during her 21-year tenure to about $_200 million in 1988 . maidenform says_0 it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics . the company sells image . its current ad_campaign , on which maidenform has spent more_than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does_n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like christopher reeve , star of the `` superman '' movies , talking_about their lingerie turn-ons . the maidenform name `` is part_of american pop culture , ''_says 0 joan sinopoli , account supervisor of the campaign by levine , huntley , schmidt & beaver , a new_york ad firm . maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as ``_i dreamed 0 i ... in my maidenform bra , '' and `` the maidenform woman . you never know where she 'll turn up . '' `` capitalizing on the brand is key , ''_says mr._brawer , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the u.s. . `` the intimate_apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -lcb- maidenform -rcb- is a force 0 to be reckoned with , ''_says david s. leibowitz , a special situations analyst_at american securities corp. in new_york . although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of the day , to retain their femininity they_are buying better quality , more upscale intimate_apparel , '' he said . although mr._brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on sept._25 precipitated the resignation of alan lesk as senior_vice president of sales and merchandising . three_days later , mr. lesk was_named president and chief_executive officer of olga co. , a competing intimate_apparel division of warnaco inc . warnaco also_owns warners , another major intimate_apparel maker . mr. lesk could_n't be_reached to comment . but maidenform officials_say that after spending 24 years at maidenform , mr. lesk , 48 , made it clear 0 he wanted the top job . `` if_you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm 0 to work for , ''_says james mogan , 45 , who was_named senior_vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of mr. lesk . the company downplayed the loss of mr. lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people . `` my style is less informal , '' mr._brawer says . top_officers insist 0 maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership . `` you_ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights . `` it is fun competing as a private company , '' mr._brawer says . `` you_can think long range . '' other major players in intimate_apparel apparently feel the same way . warnaco was taken private by spectrum group in 1986 for about $ 487 million . and last_year , playtex holdings_inc. went private for about $ 680 million . it was then split into playtex apparel inc. , the intimate_apparel division , and playtex family products corp. , which_makes tampons , hair-care items and other products . publicly_traded vf corp. , which_owns vanity fair , and sara lee corp. , which_owns bali co. , are also strong forces in intimate_apparel . buy-out offers for maidenform are n't infrequent , says_0 executive_vice president david c. masket , but they_are n't taken very seriously . when he gets calls , ``_i do_n't even have to consult '' with mrs. coleman , mr. masket says_0 . the company could command a good price in the market . `` over the past_three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have_been bought at about 60_% of sales , ''_says deborah bronston , prudential-bache_securities inc. apparel analyst . mr._brawer , along_with mrs. coleman and her daughter , elizabeth , an_attorney who is vice_chairman , are the family_members involved in the operations of maidenform , which employs_about 5,000 . mr._brawer 's wife , catherine , and robert stroup , elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board . each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings . ``_we are all very amiable , '' mr._brawer says . executives_say 0 mrs. coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product_development . in the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales . her father , william rosenthal , designed the then-dress making company 's first bra in the 1920s , which he said_0 gave women a `` maiden form '' compared_with the `` boyish form '' 0 they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time . while mr. rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his_wife , ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters . the name maidenform was coined by a third business partner , enid bissett . the company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the u.s. , puerto_rico , other_parts of the caribbean and ireland . maidenform products are mainly sold at department_stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its_own in omaha , neb. , and has 24 factory outlets , with plans to add more . before joining maidenform in 1972 , mr._brawer , who holds a doctoral degree in english from the university of chicago , taught at the university of wisconsin . as a senior_vice president , he has headed the company 's designer lingerie division , oscar de la renta , since its inception in 1988 . to maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the maidenform name . while the company has always been family-run , mr._brawer is n't the first person 0 to marry into the family and subsequently head maidenform . mrs. coleman 's husband , joseph , a physician , succeeded mrs. rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .
