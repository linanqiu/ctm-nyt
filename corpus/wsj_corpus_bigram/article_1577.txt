ltv steel co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an_average of 3_% following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products . the big questions are whether the increase , effective_jan. 1 , 1990 , will stick , and whether other major_steelmakers will follow_suit . it is widely_expected that they will . the increase is on the base price , which is already being discounted by virtually_all steel producers . but ltv 's move marks the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free_fall in spot prices . major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ 370 a ton , compared_with a peak price of $ 520 a ton in 1988 . second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton . ltv 's planned increase , which was announced in an oct._26 memo to district managers , does_n't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate . ltv confirmed the price-increase plan , saying_0 the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities . a spokesman for ltv steel , which is a unit of dallas-based ltv corp. , noted_that steel prices , adjusted_for inflation , increased only 1.7_% between 1981 and the fourth_quarter of 1988 , while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five_times as_much . at the same_time , steelmakers are trying_to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive . but analysts_say 0 the company is also trying_to prevent further price drops . moreover , they note that ltv may_be trying_to send a signal to major customers , such_as chrysler_corp. and whirlpool corp. , that steelmakers need more money . both_companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with ltv and others . `` they -lcb- ltv -rcb- may believe_0 this can impact contract_negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time 0 to get tough on prices , '' said peter marcus , an_analyst with painewebber_inc . mr. marcus believes_0 spot steel prices will_continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves . he is n't convinced , though , that the price decline reflects falling demand because the world economy remains relatively strong . and while customers such_as steel service centers are continuing to reduce inventories through the fourth_quarter , they eventually will_begin stocking up again , he notes 0 . it wo_n't be clear for months whether the price increase will stick . steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last_year , but began offering sizable discounts over the summer . in fact , ltv was the first steelmaker 0 to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped_galvanized sheet steel . in composite new_york stock_exchange trading_yesterday , ltv common_shares fell 12.5_cents to close_at $_1.50 .
