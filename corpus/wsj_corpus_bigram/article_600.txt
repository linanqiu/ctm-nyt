if_you force financial_planners to sum up their most_important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : diversify . judging by a poll of wall_street journal readers conducted this_summer by erdos & morgan inc. , serious investors have_taken that advice to heart . nearly 1,000 investors responded to the journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look_at their_portfolios . those portfolios are remarkably diversified . by spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real_estate . for_example , about 88 % of journal readers owned stock -lrb- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last_year -rrb- . but only 17.5 % said_0 they had more_than half their money in the stock_market . similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual_fund , and 33_% own municipal_bonds . but only 6_% to 7_% of the investors were committing more_than half their funds to either of those alternatives . the poll , conducted aug. 7-28 , also_provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety_of other topics . it found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . the response rate , more_than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . the results ca_n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 . nearly_half of the respondents -lrb- 47_% -rrb- said_0 their investment portfolio was worth $_250,000 or more , and 17_% said_0 it was worth $_1 million or more . the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they_were a year_ago . for_example , 12_% of this_year 's respondents said_0 they_expect a recession within 12_months . last_year , only 8_% were expecting a recession . an_additional 56_% of this_year 's respondents expect the economy to slow_down during the next 12_months . only 42_% of last_year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth . apparently , the respondents do_n't think that an economic_slowdown would harm the major investment markets very_much . a slim majority -lrb- 51_% -rrb- think_0 stock_prices will_be higher in_august 1990 than they_were in_august 1989 . their verdict on real_estate is almost the same . some 50_% expect real_estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12_months . by_contrast , only 32_% expect an_increase in the price of gold . since gold tends_to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests_that people believe_0 inflation remains under control . even_though only 12_% actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance . nearly a third said_0 they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession . for the most part , the changes were `` slight . '' the two-thirds who have n't tried_to make their_portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do_n't believe in trying_to predict the markets '' -lrb- about 31 % -rrb- and investors who `` do_n't expect a recession '' -lrb- about 15_% -rrb- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -lrb- about 22_% -rrb- . a buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents . most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more_than three_times a year . some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any . but the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market_crash still seems dark . about 33_% considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said_0 one is `` unlikely . '' those percentages hardly changed from the previous_year 's poll . and the respondents ' commitment to the stock_market remains somewhat lighter than_usual . about 60_% of them said_0 they would `` ordinarily '' have at_least 25_% of their money in stocks . but as of august , only 50_% actually had stock-market investments of that size . most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll . but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather_than a signal to jump on the bandwagon . mr. dorfman covers investing issues from the wall_street journal 's new_york bureau .
