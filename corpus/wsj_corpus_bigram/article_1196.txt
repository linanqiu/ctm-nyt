donald_trump , who faced rising doubt about his bid for american_airlines parent amr_corp. even_before a united_airlines buy-out came apart friday , withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer . separately , bankers representing the group trying_to buy united 's parent_ual corp. met_with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price , possibly around $_250 a_share , or $ 5.65 billion . but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual_board . mr._trump , who vowed wednesday to `` go forward '' with the bid , said_0 he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market_conditions . '' he said_0 he might now sell his amr stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price . the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to_obtain financing for their earlier $_300-a-share bid , which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point_drop friday in the dow_jones industrial_average . news about ual and amr , whose shares never reopened after trading was_halted friday for the ual announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . ual tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3_million shares , and amr declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7_million shares changed_hands . together , the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover_stock traders , and caused a 7.3_% drop in the dow_jones transportation average , second in size only to the stock-market_crash of oct._19 , 1987 . some said_0 friday_'s market debacle had given mr._trump an_excuse to bail_out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even_before problems emerged with the ual_deal . after reaching an intraday high of $ 107.50 the day 0 mr._trump disclosed his bid oct._5 , amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ 97.75 last_week . some takeover_stock traders had_been betting against mr._trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover_targets , then selling at a profit without making a bid . `` he still has n't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist , '' said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan_stanley &_co . `` he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little_bit of a company and then trade out of it . he 's written this book , ` the art of the deal . ' why does_n't he just follow through on one of these_things ? '' mr._trump withdrew his bid before the amr board , which is due to meet tomorrow , ever formally considered it . amr had weighed a wide_range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged_buy-outs that might_have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such_as texas billionaire robert_bass , or both . amr had also sought to foil mr._trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would_have bolstered the authority of the transportation_department to reject airline buy-outs . yesterday , mr._trump tried_to put the blame for the collapse of the ual_deal on congress , saying_0 it was rushing through a bill to_protect amr executives . ``_i believe_that the perception that legislation in this area may_be hastily approved contributed_to the collapse of the ual transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial_markets experienced this past friday , '' mr._trump wrote members of congress . amr declined to comment , and mr._trump did_n't respond to requests_for interviews . mr._trump never said how_much amr stock he had bought , only that his holdings were `` substantial . '' however , he only received federal clearance to buy more_than $ 15 million of the stock on sept. 20 , when the price rose $_2 a_share to $ 78.50 . between then and his bid on_oct. 5 , the price fluctuated between $ 75.625 and $ 87.375 . in an_attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' mr._trump promised last_week to notify the market before selling any shares . amr was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 . assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a_share , and assuming 0 he did_n't sell before his announcement reached the market , mr._trump could_be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 . some_analysts said_0 amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to_protect the nation_'s largest airline with a defensive transaction , such_as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees . however , other knowledgeable observers said_0 they believed 0 mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps . some_analysts said_0 they believed 0 mr._trump , whose towering ego had_been viewed by some as a reason to believe_0 he would n't back out , might come_back with a lower bid . ray neidl of dillon_read &_co. said_0 mr._trump `` is stepping back and waiting_for the dust to_settle . i_'m sure_0 he still wants amr . '' but others remained skeptical . ``_i was never sure_0 donald_trump really wanted to take amr , '' said john mattis , a bond analyst_with shearson_lehman hutton_inc . `` what_happened with united was a gracious way for him to bow out . '' mr._trump never obtained financing for his bid . that skepticism would_leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would handicap him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight . meanwhile , citicorp and chase_manhattan corp. , the two lead lenders on the ual_buy-out , met_with other banks yesterday to determine if_they would_be willing_to finance the buy-out at a lower price . officials familiar_with the talks said_0 citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $_250 a_share , but said_0 that price was a talking point and that no decision has_been made . at $_250 a_share , the group would_have to borrow about $ 6.1 billion from banks . the first ual_deal unraveled after citibank and chase could_n't raise $ 7.2 billion . citibank and chase had agreed_to commit $_3 billion , and said_0 they_were `` highly confident '' of raising another $_4.2 billion . together , citicorp and chase received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing . but other banks balked_at the low interest_rate and banking fees 0 the ual group was willing_to pay them . officials familiar_with the bank talks said_0 the ual_buy-out group -- ual pilots , management , and british_airways plc -- is now willing_to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely_to boost its $ 965 million equity contribution . nor is the group likely_to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders . the group 's advisers want to make certain 0 they have firm bank commitments the second time around . even_if the buy-out_group is able_to obtain_financing , the transaction still faces obstacles . ual 's board could reject the new price as too_low , especially since there_are n't any competing bids . los_angeles investor_marvin davis , whose $ 275-a-share offer was rejected by ual 's board , has n't shown signs of pursuing a $_300-a-share back-up bid 0 he made last_month . in_addition , the coalition of labor and management , longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr._davis 's bid , could break apart now . the group 's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot_union leaders convene outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting . union chairman f.c . -lrb- rick -rrb- dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused_to finance a buy-out 0 the members approved overwhelmingly last_week . the pilot_union is vowing to_pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides . but if the board rejects a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives , it could transform what has_been a harmonious process into an adversarial one . the pilots could play hardball by noting 0 they_are crucial to any sale or restructuring because_they can refuse to fly the airplanes . if_they were to insist on a low bid of , say $_200 a_share , the board might n't be_able to_obtain a higher offer from other_bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction 0 the pilots oppose . also , because ual chairman_stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots_' bid , the board might_be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other_bidders . that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder .
