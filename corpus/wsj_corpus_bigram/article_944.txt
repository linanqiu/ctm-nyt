in one of the first indoor air-pollution cases 0 to go to trial , a state-court jury decided in favor of the defendant , burlington industries_inc . the verdict , reached late_last week in cincinnati , may end an eight-year legal_battle for the greensboro , n.c. , carpet maker . glenn and sharon beebe of cincinnati had sued the com - pany in 1981 after installing burlington carpets in their office . the beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick . as a result of their illness , the beebes said_0 , they lost $_1.8 million in wages and earnings . in_addition , they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide_range of commonly used substances . the case had_been closely_watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome . plaintiffs_' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside . anthony j. iaciofano , a lawyer for burlington , said_0 the company believes_0 the beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting . he said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the beebes ' symptoms appeared months later . catherine adams , the beebes ' lawyer , said_0 the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits . scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the beebes filed the case , she said_0 . the beebes now believe_that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting . but the beebes did_n't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case , ms. adams said_0 . the beebes have not_yet decided whether to appeal . times square development opponents are dealt setback . the appellate division of new_york state supreme_court dismissed six lawsuits attempting_to block a $_2.5 billion project planned for 42nd street in manhattan . opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of new_york , which are co-sponsoring the project , had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines . all but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have_been filed since the project 's 1984 approval have_been dismissed before the trial stage . the two that remain have n't_yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage . state officials said_0 the court 's ruling clears the way for proceedings 0 to condemn buildings in the area . `` this project is ready to move , '' said state urban_development corp. chairman vincent tese . but developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain . as_part of the agreement_with the state , the developers -- a partnership of park tower realty and prudential_insurance co. of america -- said_0 they would not proceed_with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending . park tower general_counsel matthew mayer said_0 the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $_155 million letter of credit 0 to cover condemnation costs . also , he said_0 , the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division 's ruling will_be appealed . the plan , which has_been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks , seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district . state and city_officials are still negotiating_with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel . federal_judge expands role of u.s. courts in extradition decisions . u.s._district judge jack b. weinstein of brooklyn , n.y. , ruled_that a man implicated in an attack on an israeli passenger bus in 1986 can_be extradited to israel for trial . a magistrate had initially refused the request , ruling that the attack had_been a political act for which the man , mahmoud el-abed ahmad , would_be exempt_from extradition . however , judge weinstein wrote in his opinion late_last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can_not be defined_as political acts . judge weinstein also ruled_that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will_be treated fairly in a foreign court . to do_so , the judge said_0 , the u.s. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the state_department 's assessment . he said that in this case he concurred with the state_department 's decision that mr. ahmad should_be extradited . mr. ahmad 's lawyer said_0 he would appeal . lawyers close to the case said_0 they believed 0 the ruling was unprecedented . `` up until_now the courts have said_0 it is not their role to supervise the foreign country 's courts , '' said jacques semmelman , the assistant_u.s. attorney on the case . former canadian ambassador to the u.s. allan e. gotlieb has joined the philadelphia law_firm of pepper , hamilton & scheetz as a consultant . mr. gotlieb , who serves as a consultant to stikeman , elliott , one of canada 's_biggest law_firms , is advising pepper hamilton 's washington office on legal matters related to canadian-u.s. investment , corporate_finance and international transactions . quotable : in a speech prepared for_delivery in new_york yesterday , retired justice lewis powell contested the notion_that the last supreme_court term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction ' on the court ... . i take these pronouncements , like many that have preceded them in past years , with a grain of salt . in an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term .
