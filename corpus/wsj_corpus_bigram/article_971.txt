a surprising surge in the u.s._trade deficit raised fears that the nation_'s export drive has stalled , and caused new turmoil in financial_markets . the merchandise_trade deficit widened in_august to $_10.77 billion , the commerce_department reported 0 , a sharp deterioration from july 's $ 8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this_year . exports fell for the second month in a row , while imports rose to a record . `` this is one of the worst trade releases 0 we_'ve had since the dollar troughed out in 1987 , '' said geoffrey dennis , chief international economist_at james_capel inc . like most analysts , mr. dennis was hesitant to read too_much into one_month 's numbers ; but he said , `` it indicates perhaps that the balance in the u.s._economy is not as good as we_'ve been led to believe . '' the number had a troubling effect_on wall_street , suggesting_that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last_friday 's stock_market slide . the dow_jones industrial_average tumbled more_than 60_points after the report 's release , before recovering to close 18.65 points_lower at 2638.73 . `` this bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline , '' said norman robertson , chief_economist for mellon bank . `` it raises_questions about more deep-seated problems , the budget_deficit and the trade_deficit and the seeming lack_of ability_to come to grips with them . '' the trade report drew yet_another unsettling parallel to october_1987 . on_oct. 14 of that year , the announcement of an_unusually large august trade_deficit helped trigger a steep market decline . the slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on_oct. 19 . in 1987 , however , the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade , while the current report comes after a period of improvement . the bleak trade report was played down by the bush_administration . commerce secretary robert mosbacher called the worsening trade_figures `` disappointing after two very_good months . '' and white_house spokesman marlin_fitzwater said_0 the deficit was `` an unwelcome increase , '' adding_that ``_we 're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around . '' but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u.s._trade deficit has run out of steam . `` the figures today add further evidence 0 to support the view that the improvement in the u.s._trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $_110 billion annual_rate , '' said jeffrey scott , a research fellow at the institute for international economics here . `` that 's still an improvement over last_year , but it leads one to conclude that basically we_'ve gotten all the mileage 0 we_can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal_budget deficit . '' exports declined for the second_consecutive month in_august , slipping 0.2_% to $ 30.41 billion , the commerce_department reported 0 . imports , on the other_hand , leaped 6.4_% to a record $ 41.18 billion . not_only was august 's deficit far worse_than july 's , but the government revised the july figure substantially from the $ 7.58 billion deficit 0 it had initially reported last_month . many_economists contend_that deep cuts in the u.s. budget_deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur . that 's because the budget_deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this_country for both foreign goods and foreign capital , overwhelming the nation_'s capacity to export . `` people are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits , but the imbalances are still there and they_are still a problem , '' said mr. robertson . in_addition , the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign_currencies over the past_several months has increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness . since march , exports have_been virtually flat . at the same_time , william t. archey , international vice_president at the u.s. chamber of commerce , notes : `` clearly the stronger_dollar has made imports more_attractive '' by causing their prices to decline . most economists_expect the slowing u.s._economy to curb demand_for imports . but they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal_budget deficit come down . `` the best result 0 we could_get from these numbers would_be to see the administration and congress get serious_about putting the u.s. on an internationally competitive economic footing , '' said howard lewis , vice_president of international economic_affairs at the national_association of manufacturers . `` that must start with cutting the federal_budget deficit . '' august 's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies , capital_goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles , parts and engines . the jump in imports stemmed_from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods . the numbers were adjusted_for usual seasonal fluctuations . alan murray contributed_to this_article . -lrb- in billions of u.s. dollars , not seasonally_adjusted -rrb- \* newly industrialized countries : singapore , hong_kong , taiwan , south_korea
