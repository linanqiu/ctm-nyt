the latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke 0 t. boone pickens tells about the guy_who was run over by the parade . when asked `` what went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` it was a combination of things . '' and so it was on gray friday . the grand marshal of this parade would appear to have_been excess leverage . even_if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have_been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout -lrb- e -rrb- . the ceremonies began friday_afternoon when word spread that the ual_buy-out was collapsing . although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting_of less cash , the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending . lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling federal_reserve tightness ; and the bush_administration 's -lrb- temporary ? -rrb- defeat in trying_to lower the capital-gains_tax . as_usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program_traders , although most serious studies suggest 0 they only play the music that others write . what really spooked the crowds along wall_street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up . gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather_than the small_investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing . deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . ual , which triggered the slide , opened monday at $ 224 , down about 20_% from thursday 's close . amr opened monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20_% from thursday 's close . -lrb- both took further hits yesterday . -rrb- hilton lost 20_% on friday ; paramount lost almost 11_% . a careful look reveals that where deal financing has_been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on friday . the multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and\/or issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated . the market for so-called junk_bonds has_been setting the stage for friday_'s dramatic march for several_weeks . the growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such_as resorts international , integrated_resources , and campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall_over the entire market for high-yield securities . investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk_bonds by ohio mattress and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring . as a result , high-yield mutual_funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk_bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times . these are all market excesses -lrb- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax_code gives to debt over equity -rrb- , and what we_'ve seen is the market reining them in . of course , washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on friday . if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday , what are the implications for policy_makers ? after all , the stock_market 's response to the collapse of the ual_deal might_be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators . is this a case where private markets are approving of washington 's bashing of wall_street ? absolutely not . to the extent that friday_'s sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that wall_street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings . the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . if takeover premiums become excessive , if lbo dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy_makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions . yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year . not surprisingly , he sometimes bites . the arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on gray friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily . if_you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede_that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely_to come from the marketplace than from washington . if_you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the delaware courts should never be underestimated . the truth is , washington understands politics better_than economics . although the average citizen is probably not harmed too_much from washington 's rhetorical war against wall_street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . any such attempt_to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such_as the airlines , is_likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . far better for policy_makers to concentrate_on the war against drugs , panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end . mr. jarrell , former top economist_at the securities and exchange_commission , teaches at the university of rochester 's simon business school .
