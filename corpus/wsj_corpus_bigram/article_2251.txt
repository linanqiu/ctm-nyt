federal health officials are_expected today to approve a program granting long-deferred access to the drug azt for children with acquired_immune deficiency_syndrome . announcement of the approval is_expected to be made by louis sullivan , secretary of health and human_services . the clearance by the food and drug_administration comes after two_years of restricted access for the youngest victims of aids to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease . the drug will_be given treatment investigational new drug status , a label accorded to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval . the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection . adults with aids have had access to azt since fda approved the drug 's usage for adults in march 1987 . but despite more_than two_years of research showing 0 azt can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children , the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients . as a result , many youngsters have_been unable_to obtain the drug and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo_n't cover its cost of $ 6,400 a year . so_far , aids has stricken 1,859 children under age 13 , with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms . to date , 1,013 of those children have died , according_to the federal centers for disease control . mothers of young aids patients expressed somber satisfaction . `` thank goodness 0 it 's happening . it should have happened sooner , '' said elizabeth glaser , a los_angeles mother and activist who contracted the aids virus through a blood transfusion , and transmitted it to two of her children . one of them , a daughter ariel , died a year_ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug . ``_i could_get azt , ''_says mrs. glaser , who bears her infection without_any symptoms . `` but my daughter could_n't , until she was too ill to take it . to watch your child die is an inhuman experience . '' her son , healthy and symptom-free , currently takes no medication . the delay in getting azt to children has_been blamed on a combination of factors . traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two_years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety_standards and red_tape . secondly , critics have charged azt 's maker burroughs wellcome co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small part_of the large and lucrative market . wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to compile the relevant data , and recently promised to develop a pediatric syrup form easier 0 for youngsters to take . still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after philip pizzo of the national_cancer institute offered evidence that azt could reverse the ravages of aids dementia , sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of iq levels and reappearance of lost motor skills . since_then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the drug in his program . to some mothers , the expected fda action is a poignant reminder of what might_have been . `` my first reaction is 0 i_do n't understand why it 's taken so_long . why has it taken people so_long for people to understand 0 pediatric aids is a major problem ? '' asked helen kushnick , whose son samuel died six_years ago at age three , victim of a tainted transfusion . similar sentiments were voiced on_capitol hill . `` while i_'m pleased 0 the fda is finally releasing azt for children , it 's taken much too_long to get to this point , '' said rep. ted weiss . `` why did it take burroughs wellcome so_long to apply '' for treatment investigational new drug status ? the new_york democrat asked . `` let 's not forget 0 this is the same company that has_been profiteering with this drug for 2_1\/2 years , '' mr. weiss added . mrs. glaser , who is a co-founder of the pediatric aids foundation , based in santa_monica , calif. , condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging . `` there 's no finger 0 to be pointed , '' she said . `` the crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well , and to make_sure 0 other experimental drugs , like bristol-myers co. 's ddi , do_n't follow the same frustrating course as azt . '' aids dementia -- which gradually steals children 's ability_to speak , walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome . for some patients , azt has restored the ability_to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily . `` it 's impossible to overstate how_much this means to the families of these patients , '' said samuel broder , director of the national_cancer institute and a main developer of azt .
