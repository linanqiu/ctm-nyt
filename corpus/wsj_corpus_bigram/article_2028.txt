y.j. park and her family scrimped for four_years to buy a tiny apartment here , but found that the closer they got to saving the $ 40,000 0 they originally needed , the more the price rose . by this_month , it had more_than doubled . now the 33-year-old housewife , whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics , is saving harder than_ever . ``_i am determined to get an apartment in three_years , '' she_says . `` it 's all 0 i_think about or talk_about . '' for the parks and millions of other young koreans , the long-cherished dream of home ownership has_become a cruel illusion . for the government , it has_become a highly volatile political issue . last may , a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem . during the past 15_years , the report showed 0 , housing prices increased nearly fivefold . the report laid the blame on speculators , who it said_0 had pushed land prices up ninefold . the panel found that since 1987 , real-estate prices_rose nearly 50_% in a speculative fever fueled_by economic prosperity , the 1988 seoul olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop korea 's southwest . the result is that those rich enough to own any real_estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially . for those with no holdings , the prospects of buying a home are ever slimmer . in 1987 , a quarter of the population owned 91 % of the nation_'s 71,895 square kilometers of private land , the report said_0 , and 10_% of the population owned 65_% of the land devoted to housing . meanwhile , the government 's land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their_own homes . rents have soared along_with house prices . former national assemblyman hong sa-duk , now a radio commentator , says_0 the problem is intolerable for many_people . ``_i 'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation is n't corrected , '' he_adds . in fact , during the past_three months there have_been several demonstrations at the office complex where the land bureau is housed , and at the national assembly , demanding 0 the government put a stop to real-estate speculation . president_roh tae woo 's administration has_been studying the real-estate crisis for the past year with an_eye to partial land redistribution . last_week , the government took three bills to the national assembly . the proposed legislation is aimed_at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system . highlights of the bills , as currently framed , are : -- a restriction on the amount of real_estate 0 one family can own , to 660 square meters in the nation_'s six largest cities , but more in smaller cities and rural areas . the government will penalize offenders , but wo_n't confiscate property . -- a tax of between 3_% and 6_% on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling . -- taxes of between 15_% and 50_% a year on `` excessive '' profits from the resale of property , or the sale of idle land to the government . the government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar-sized properties in an area . -- grace periods ranging_from two to five_years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect . the administration says_0 the measures would stem rampant property speculation , free more land for the government 's ambitious housing-construction program , designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and , perhaps , boost the popular standing of president_roh . but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south_korea 's renters say_0 the proposed_changes do_n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home . some want lower limits_on house sizes ; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots . the citizens coalition for economic justice , a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform , wants restrictions_on landholdings , high taxation of capital_gains , and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based . but others , large landowners , real-estate developers and business_leaders , say_0 the government 's proposals are intolerable . led_by the federation of korean industries , the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties . government_officials who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business_leaders and chafe at their pressure . `` there_is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing , ''_says lee kyu hwang , director of the government 's land bureau , which drafted the bills . but , he_adds 0 , the constitution empowers the government to impose some controls , to mitigate the shortage of land . the land available for housing construction stands at about 46.2 square meters a person -- 18_% lower_than in taiwan and only about_half that of japan . mr._lee estimates that about 10,000 property speculators are operating in south_korea . the chief culprits , he_says 0 , are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land `` not for their corporate use , but for resale at huge profit . '' one research_institute calculated that as_much as 67 % of corporate-owned land is held by 403 companies -- and that as little as 1.5 % of that is used for business . the government 's office of bank supervision and examination told the national assembly this_month that in the first_half of 1989 , the nation_'s 30 largest business groups bought real_estate valued_at $_1.5 billion . the ministry of finance , as a result , has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real_estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed_at individuals . under those measures , financial_institutions would_be restricted from owning any more real_estate than they need for their business operations . banks , investment and credit firms would_be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50_% of their capital -- currently the proportion is 75_% . the maximum allowable property holdings for insurance_companies would_be reduced to 10_% of their total asset_value , down from 15_% currently . but mrs. park acknowledges_that even_if the policies work to slow or stop speculation , apartment prices are unlikely to go down . at best , she realizes 0 , they will rise more slowly -- more slowly , she hopes 0 , than her family 's income .
