ekco group_inc. , nashua , n.h. , expects to report that net_income in the third_quarter , ended_oct. 1 , fell 50_% to 60_% from $_2.1 million , or 11 cents_a share , a year_earlier . robert stein , president and chief_executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last_month at the company 's masillon , ohio , bakeware facility . softer-than-expected orders in early september also played a role , he said_0 in an_interview . but mr._stein said_0 he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $_3.1 million , or 17 cents_a share , in 1988 . that would_require fourth-quarter_net of more_than about 22_cents to 24 cents_a share , assuming that mr._stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate . in the year-earlier fourth_quarter , the company had profit of $_2.7 million , or 15 cents_a share . third-quarter revenue is_expected to be $_40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year_earlier , according_to neil gordon , treasurer . the year-earlier periods do_n't reflect results of the company 's woodstream corp. unit , acquired last january , but include some canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 . august through october traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items . mr._stein said_0 some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in_september but have_been ordering more heavily in october . mr._stein said_0 woodstream is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as_well as expected . woodstream 's victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very_well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said_0 . but the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering_from a `` depressed market , '' and ekco is_seeking to sell that segment , he said_0 . mr._stein said_0 he_expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number_of measures taken since the acquisition of ekco housewares in late 1987 . -lrb- prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known_as centronics corp. ; centronics had_been a maker of computer printers , but mr._stein and other officers decided to sell that business after japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . -rrb- mr._stein said_0 tighter operating controls have enabled ekco to reduce inventory levels 25_% to 30_% ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95_% from around 70_% ; and to lower the number_of labor hours required to produce a unit . by moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has_been able_to come_up with designs that can_be manufactured more_efficiently , he said_0 . in_addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier_this year to install displays at its customers ' retail_outlets -- a strategy that mr._stein said_0 has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands . ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as_well as bakeware , at factories in the u.s. and canada . the main issue in the strike at the ohio facility was health-care benefits , mr._stein said_0 . the strike ended oct . ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , mr._stein said_0 . he indicated_that ekco may_be interested_in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $_75 million to $_100 million , partly_because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely_on larger , and fewer , suppliers .
