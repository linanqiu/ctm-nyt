the bond_market , which sometimes thrives on bad_news , cheered yesterday 's stock_market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker . early in the day , bonds rose_modestly on economists ' forecasts that this_week 's slate of economic_data will portray an economy headed for trouble . such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the federal_reserve to lower_interest rates in an_effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . for_example , today the department of commerce is_scheduled to release the september durable_goods report . the consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by dow_jones capital_markets report is for a 1.2_% drop in_september orders . that would follow a 3.9_% advance in_august . bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock_prices moved broadly lower . the dow_jones industrial_average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . `` bond investors have_been watching stocks closely , '' said joel marver , chief fixed-income analyst_at technical data global markets group . `` when_you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said_0 . the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond ended about 1\/2_point higher , or up about $_5 for each $_1,000 face_amount , while the yield slid to 7.93_% from 7.98_% friday . municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade_corporate bonds rose . prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended_unchanged . in more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk_bonds , a $_150 million issue by imo_industries inc. was snapped_up by investors while underwriters for beatrice co. 's $_350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers . in the treasury market , analysts_expect bond_prices to trade in narrow ranges this_week as the market takes in positive and negative news . `` on the negative side , the market will_be affected_by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said william m. brachfeld , economist_at daiwa_securities america inc . `` on the other_hand , we have economic news that is -lcb- expected to be -rcb- relatively positive for the bond_market . we will_go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly_lower yields , '' he said . today , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year_notes . tomorrow , resolution_funding corp. , a division of a new government agency_created to bail_out the nation_'s troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $_4.5 billion of 30-year_bonds . so_far , money_managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the refcorp bonds . analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . while some say_0 the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend_that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed_securities by ford_motor credit corp. may_have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . the division of auto_maker ford_motor co. made its debut in the asset-backed_securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . the company offered securities_backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed_by first_boston corp . the issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9_% of the deal from the company . first_boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an_apparent effort to place the huge offering . the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage_point above the yield on two-year treasurys . the only asset-backed deal larger than ford 's was a $_4 billion offering by general_motors acceptance_corp. in 1986 . treasury_securities treasury_bonds were 1\/8 to 1\/2_point higher yesterday in light trading . the benchmark_30-year bond ended at a price of 102 3\/32 , compared_with 101 17\/32 friday . the latest_10-year notes were_quoted late at 100 17\/32 to yield 7.90_% , compared_with 100 3\/32 to yield 7.97 % . the latest two-year_notes were_quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 7.84 % . short-term_rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly treasury bill_auction , compared_with the previous bill sale . the treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an_average discount_rate of 7.52_% , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on_oct. 10 . the $ 7.81 billion of six-month treasury_bills were sold with an_average discount_rate of 7.50_% , the highest since the average of 7.60_% at the oct. 10 auction . the rates were up from last_week 's auction , when they_were 7.37_% and 7.42_% , respectively . here are auction details : rates are determined_by the difference_between the purchase_price and face_value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . the percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based_on a 365-day year . both issues are dated_oct. 26 . the 13-week bills_mature jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week_bills mature april 26 , 1990 . corporate issues investment-grade corporates closed about 1\/4_point higher in quiet_trading . in the junk_bond market , imo_industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was_priced at_par to yield 12_% . peter karches , managing_director at underwriter morgan_stanley &_co. , said_0 the issue was oversubscribed . `` it 's a segmented market , and if_you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite_for it , '' he said . morgan_stanley is_expected to price another junk_bond deal , $_350 million of senior_subordinated debentures by continental cablevision inc. , next_tuesday . in light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk_bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they_are offered to investors . in the case of beatrice , salomon_brothers inc. is_considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $_200 million portion_of the offering . under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would_have been reset annually at a fixed spread_above treasurys . under the new plan being_considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate 0 to maintain a market_value of 101 . price talk calls_for the reset_notes to be priced_at a yield of between 13 1\/4 % and 13 1\/2_% . mortgage-backed_securities activity in derivative_markets was strong with four new real_estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . the federal_national mortgage_association offered $_1.2 billion of remic securities in three issues , and the federal_home loan_mortgage corp. offered a $_250 million remic backed_by 9_% 15-year securities . part_of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative_markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage_securities being_sold by thrifts . traders_said 0 thrifts have stepped_up their mortgage_securities sales as the bond_market has_risen in the past_two weeks . in the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the treasury market . government national_mortgage association 9_% securities for november_delivery were_quoted late_yesterday at_98 10\/32 , up 10\/32 ; and freddie_mac 9_% securities were at_97 1\/2 , up 1\/4 . the ginnie_mae 9_% issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12-year_average life_assumption , as the spread_above the treasury_10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage_points . municipals a $ 575 million san_antonio , texas , electric and gas system revenue bond_issue dominated the new issue sector . the refunding issue , which had_been in the wings for two_months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . but alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary_market , where prices were off 1\/8 to up 3\/8 point . an_official with lead_underwriter first_boston said_0 orders for the san_antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' he attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as_well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . in_addition , he_noted 0 , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such_as hurricane_hugo and the northern_california earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand_for bonds . a $ 137.6 million maryland stadium authority sports facilities lease revenue bond_issue appeared to be off to a good start . the issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very_well , '' according_to an_official with lead_underwriter morgan_stanley . activity quieted in the new_york city bond_market , where heavy investor selling last_week drove yields_on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as_much as 0.50 percentage_point . foreign bonds japanese government bonds_ended lower after the dollar rose_modestly against the yen . the turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about japan 's bond_market . the benchmark no._111 4.6_% bond_due 1998_ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 95.39 , off 0.28 . the yield rose to 5.38 % . west_german bond_prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading . the benchmark 7_% bond_due october_1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6_3\/4 % notes_due july_1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % . british_government bonds_ended slightly_higher in quiet_trading as investors looked ahead to today 's british trade report . the benchmark 11_3\/4 % treasury_bond due_2003\/2007 rose 1\/8 to 111 21\/32 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12_% issue of 1995 rose 3\/32 to 103 23\/32 to yield 11.01 % .
