the recently revived enthusiasm among small_investors for stock mutual_funds has_been damped by a jittery stock_market and the tumult over program_trading . after hitting two-year highs this_summer , net sales of stock funds slowed in_september , according_to the investment company institute , a trade_group . the sales recovery screeched to a halt this_month , some_analysts say_0 . `` confidence was starting to come_back because we did_n't have wildly volatile days , ''_says tyler jenks , research_director for kanon bloch carre &_co. , a boston research_firm . `` now everything '' -- such_as program_trading and wide stock_market swings -- `` that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there . '' net sales of stock funds in_september totaled_$ 839.4 million , down from $_1.1 billion in_august , the institute said_0 . but if reinvested dividends are excluded , investors put in only $ 340 million more_than they pulled_out for the month . october 's numbers , which wo_n't be_released for a month , are down further , mutual_fund executives_say 0 . investors in stock funds did_n't panic the weekend after mid-october 's 190-point market_plunge . most of the those_who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds . and some fund groups said_0 investors actually became net buyers . but the stock_market swings have continued . the recent outcry over program_trading will cast a pall_over the stock-fund environment in the coming_months , some_analysts say_0 . `` the public is very close to having had it , '' mr. jenks says . investors pulled_back from bond_funds in_september , too . net sales of bond_funds for the month totaled_$ 1.1_billion , down two-thirds from $_3.1 billion in_august . the major reason_: heavy outflows from high-risk , high-yield_junk bond_funds . big withdrawals from the junk_funds have continued this_month . overall , net sales of all mutual_funds , excluding money market funds , fell to $_1.9 billion in_september from $_4.2 billion in_august , the trade_group said_0 . `` small net inflows into stock and bond_funds were offset_by slight declines in the value of mutual_fund stock and bond portfolios '' stemming_from falling prices , said_0 jacob dreyer , the institute 's chief_economist . many_small investors went for the safety of money market funds . assets of these and other short-term funds surged more_than $_5 billion in_september , the institute said_0 . analysts_say 0 additional investors transferred their assets into money_funds this_month . at fidelity_investments , the nation_'s largest fund group , money_funds continue to draw the most business , says_0 michael hines , vice_president , marketing . in october , net sales of stock funds at fidelity dropped_sharply , mr. hines said_0 . but he emphasized that new accounts , new sales , inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this_month from september 's level . investor_interest in stock funds `` has n't stalled at all , '' mr. hines maintains 0 . he notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed_from a three-day period following the friday the 13th plunge . `` if that follows through next_month , then it will_be a different story , '' he_says . but , mr. hines adds , 0 sales `` based_on a few_days ' events do_n't tell_you much about october 's trends . '' one trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds . buoyed_by the continued inflows into money_funds , assets of all mutual_funds swelled to a record $ 953.8 billion in_september , up fractionally from $ 949.3 billion in_august . stock-fund managers , meantime , went_into october with less cash on hand than they held earlier_this year . these managers held 9.8 % of assets in cash at the end of september , down from 10.2 % in_august and 10.6 % in_september 1988 . large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets . managers of junk_funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the september cash_crunch at campeau corp . junk-portfolio managers raised their cash_position to 9.4 % of assets in_september from 8.3 % in_august . in_september 1988 , that level was 9.5_% . investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming_months , some_analysts say_0 . among stock funds , the conservative growth-and-income portfolios probably will_remain popular , fund specialists say_0 . `` there will_be a continuation and possibly greater focus_on conservative equity funds , at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds , ''_says avi nachmany , an_analyst at strategic insight , a new_york fund-research concern .
