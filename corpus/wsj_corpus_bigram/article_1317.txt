the oil industry 's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year . major oil_companies in the next_few days are_expected to report much_less robust earnings than they_did for the third_quarter a year_ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . the gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are_likely to remain weak , industry_executives and analysts_say 0 , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . the industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' glenn cox , president of phillips_petroleum co. , said_0 in an_interview . `` that change will obviously impact third and fourth_quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he_added 0 . he did_n't forecast phillips 's results . but securities analysts_say 0 phillips will_be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will_probably post a drop in third-quarter_earnings . so , too , many analysts_predict 0 , will exxon_corp. , chevron_corp. and amoco corp . typical is what_happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil_companies . it has plunged 13_% since_july to around 26_cents a pound . a year_ago ethylene sold for 33_cents , peaking at about 34_cents last_december . a big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion . beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing u.s._economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . companies added capacity furiously . now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic_growth is slower . third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . `` refining margins were so good in the third_quarter of last_year and generally not very_good this_year , '' said william randol , a securities analyst_at first_boston corp . oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare_for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did_n't materialize . the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . in_addition , crude_oil prices were up some from a year_earlier , further pressuring profitability . refiners say_0 margins picked_up in_september , and many industry officials believe_0 gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth_quarter . during the 1988 second_half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . crude_oil production may turn_out to be the most surprising element of companies_' earnings this_year . prices -- averaging roughly $_2 a_barrel higher in the third_quarter than a year_earlier -- have stayed well_above most companies_' expectations . demand has_been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth_quarter . ``_we could see higher oil_prices this_year , '' said bryan jacoboski , an_analyst at painewebber_inc . that will translate_into sharply_higher production profits , particularly compared_with last_year when oil_prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a_barrel in the fourth_quarter . while oil_prices have_been better_than expected , natural_gas prices have_been worse . in the third_quarter , they averaged about 5_% less_than they_were in 1988 . the main_reason remains weather . last_summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural_gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . this_summer , on the other_hand , had milder weather than_usual . ``_we 've_been very disappointed in the performance of natural_gas prices , '' said mr. cox , phillips 's president . `` the lagging gas price is not_going to_assist fourth_quarter performance as many had expected 0 . '' going into the fourth_quarter , natural_gas prices are anywhere from 8_% to 17_% lower_than a year_earlier . for_instance , natural_gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ 1.47 a thousand cubic_feet , down 13_% from $ 1.69 a thousand cubic_feet a year_ago .
