signs of a slowing_economy are increasing pressure_on the federal_reserve to cut short-term_interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central_bank will do_so . a survey by the fed 's 12 district banks shows 0 economic_growth has_been sluggish in recent_weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated . `` the economy is clearly slowing , ''_says robert black , president of the richmond federal_reserve bank . `` if_you look_at the third_quarter as posting roughly 2.5_% growth , i_do see some slowing in the fourth_quarter , '' agrees kansas_city fed president roger guffey . nevertheless , both mr. guffey and mr. black say_0 the slowdown so_far is no cause for concern . ``_we 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point_where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur , '' said mr. guffey . bush_administration officials are_looking to the fed to bring down rates , and financial_markets seem to be expecting easier credit as_well . ``_i think_0 the market had_been expecting the fed to ease sooner and a little more_than it has to date , '' said robert johnson , vice_president of global markets for bankers_trust co . the fed cut the key federal_funds interest_rate by about 0.25 percentage_point to 8.75_% after the oct._13 stock_market plunge , but has_shown no_sign of movement since . the report from the fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has_been weak in recent_weeks . the philadelphia fed , for_instance , reported that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row . and in the chicago district , the report said_0 , `` a manufacturer of capital_goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . '' retail_sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big-ticket items such_as furniture , home appliances and consumer_electronics . '' and construction also was described_as slow in most areas . despite the economic_slowdown , there_are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt . as a result , fed officials may_be divided over whether to ease_credit . several fed governors in washington have_been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional fed presidents have_been resisting such a move . mr. black said_0 he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does_n't see `` a_lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . '' `` there_is always a chance of recession , '' added mr. guffey , `` but if_you ask me to put a percentage on it , i would think_0 it 's well_below a 50_% chance .
