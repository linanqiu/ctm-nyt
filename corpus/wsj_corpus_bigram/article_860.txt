from a helicopter a thousand feet above oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in u.s. history , a scene of devastation emerges : a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich , hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments , abandoned autos . but this quake was n't the big one , the replay of 1906 that has_been feared for so_many years . despite the tragic loss of more_than 270 lives , and damage estimated in the billions , most businesses and their plants and offices in the bay_area were n't greatly affected . the economic life of the region is_expected to revive in a day or two , although some transportation problems may last weeks or months . a main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the silicon_valley and more_than 50 miles from downtown san_francisco and oakland . also , the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage . the tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance , so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows , falling brick and cornices , buckled asphalt or sidewalks . of course , the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned silicon_valley into the nation_'s capital of high_technology . like other major american cities , the san_francisco -- oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands_of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world 's great natural harbors . when the tremors struck , the region 's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air . michael l. bandler , vice_president for network technology at pacific_bell telephone co. , says_0 nearly all the network 's computer switches , which move thousands_of calls a minute from one location to another , changed to battery power when the city lost power . the battery packs have enough power for only three_hours , but that gave emergency crews time 0 to turn on an_emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel . of some 160 switches in pacific_bell 's network , only four went_down . one of those was in hollister , calif. , near the earthquake 's epicenter . few telephone_lines snapped . that 's because the widely_used fiber-optic cable has_been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points . the slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake . nevertheless , phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late_yesterday a third of san_francisco remained without power . business in the nation_'s fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed ; an_estimated one million members of the work_force stayed at home . the economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself , as virtually_all businesses shut_down . the $ 125-billion-a-year bay_area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation_'s most populous state and accounts for 2_% to 3_% of the nation_'s total output of goods and services , according_to the center for continuing study of the california economy in palo_alto . in high-tech , the bay_area accounts for 15_% to 20_% of the u.s. computer-related industry . `` this has_been a major disruption for the bay_area economy , ''_says pauline sweezey , the chief_economist at the california department of finance . ``_obviously , things are going_to have to go on hold for many companies . '' the damage to the bay_area 's roadways could cause significant economic hardship . a quarter of a million people cross the bay_bridge every_day , far_more than the 100,000 that use the bay_area rapid transit system -lrb- bart -rrb- -- which was working but was n't stopping in the city 's financial_district yesterday_afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks . california state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say_0 they nevertheless do_n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the bay_area . all major roadways except interstate 880 , known_as the nimitz_freeway , and the bay_bridge were open by 1_p.m. yesterday . officials expect difficulty routing traffic through downtown san_francisco . the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack , making them impassible . other roads were obstructed by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines , an_emergency relief spokesman says_0 . san_francisco mayor_art agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $_2 billion . but many predicted that the commercial disruption would_be short-lived . of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper , few reported any damage that they_did n't_expect to have remedied within a day or two . it is possible , of course , that some of the most seriously damaged companies could_n't be_reached , particularly in areas nearest the epicenter . typical , perhaps , was the situation at new united motor manufacturing inc. , the general_motors corp.-toyota joint-venture auto plant in fremont , about 35 miles south of oakland . ten of the plant 's workers were_injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift ; seven were hospitalized . metal racks on the plant floor fell over , and water mains ruptured , a spokeswoman says_0 . the plant was evacuated and workers sent home . but the plant was able_to resume limited production of its toyota corollas and geo prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday , and absenteeism was only 7_% of the work_force , about twice normal . computer_maker hewlett-packard_co. , based in palo_alto , says_0 one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation . other buildings had broken glass , dangling light fixtures and broken pipes , a spokesperson says_0 , estimating the cost of reconstruction `` in the millions . '' most banks were closed but were expected to reopen_today with few problems anticipated . at the federal_reserve bank of san_francisco , vice_president robert fienberg says_0 operations were `` steaming along as_usual '' yesterday_afternoon . ` when the quake hit , we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up , '' he_says . the fed serves as a middleman for banks , taking checks from one bank and sending them to another , an operation that it handled smoothly tuesday_night after the quake . `` the volume 0 we received from the banks was a_lot lower_than usual , '' he_says . a disaster-contingency plan in which the los_angeles fed would come to san_francisco 's aid was n't needed , he_adds 0 . most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed_from congestion . the telephone network simply could_n't handle the large_number of people seeking to make a call at the same_time . the volume resulted in dial-tone delays that were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five_minutes . mr. bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal . american_telephone &_telegraph co. , mci_communications inc. and united telecommunications ' u_s sprint unit were blocking phone_calls into the bay_area to alleviate congestion . the companies block traffic much_as highway on-ramps are blocked when traffic backs up . william_e. downing , pacific_bell 's vice_president of customer services for the bay_area , says_0 most long-distance companies were blocking about 50_% of all calls . pacific_telesis says_0 its pacific_bell unit also was blocking about 50_% of its calls locally . ironically , the long-term effect of the earthquake may_be to bolster the bay_area 's economic fortunes and , indeed , the nation_'s gross_national product . it may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such_as double-deck highways . `` it would in the near-term give a boost to the san_francisco economy because there will_be an influx of people 0 to help , ''_says beth burnham mace , a regional economist_at dri\/mcgraw hill , a lexington , mass. , forecasting firm . the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand . `` there will_be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state , federal and local employment , '' ms. mace says . adds stacy kotman , an_economist at georgia state_university , `` there 's nothing positive about an earthquake , but it will_probably generate more construction activity . '' wall_street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies . shares of lone_star industries_inc. , a cement maker , rose_sharply in_anticipation of stepped-up demand . in greenwich , conn. , lone_star spokesman michael london says , 0 ``_obviously with an earthquake of this size , there_are likely_to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have_been anticipated . but any increase is n't likely_to be any kind_of a surge . it 's something likely_to be spread out over a long period of time . there will_be a_lot of repair work that wo_n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would . '' lone_star 's san_francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake . the earthquake is_likely to reduce gnp negligibly in the near_term and then could raise it a_bit as rebuilding begins . the first effects are , of course , negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending . corporate_profits may also dip initially . many of the lost tourism dollars wo_n't be recovered ; many trips delayed never take_place . subsequently , however , the ill effects are_likely to be offset , at_least in economic terms , as construction activity begins . because of the way_0 the government keeps its books , the damage to the bay_bridge , however costly , wo_n't be_counted as a minus . the money spent on repairs will_be counted as a plus . `` it 's very_difficult to model the long-term impact of this , ''_says andrew goldberg , who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the center for strategic international studies in washington , d.c . `` you certainly can say_0 it 's going_to be extremely severe . we really are talking_about shutting down a major american city for a number_of days , maybe for a few_weeks . '' mr._goldberg says_0 the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $_1 billion and could reach $_4 billion . he cautions that early damage estimates are often low ; the damage totals in hurricane_hugo increased tenfold as more information was received . the earthquake_damage , of course , would_have been far_greater if the epicenter had_been in downtown san_francisco . a direct hit on a major city , mr._goldberg figures 0 , would cause $ 20 billion to $_40 billion of damage . experts caution that it is far too_soon for reliable estimates of the quake 's total damage , but it 's clear that insurers are_likely to pay out enormous sums . jack byrne , the chairman of fireman_'s fund corp. , which is based in novato , calif. , estimates 0 insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $_2 billion . the impact_on the insurance industry `` will_be big and harsh , but less_than -lcb- hurricane -rcb- hugo , ''_says 0 mr. byrne , who toured the bay_area by car yesterday_afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake . mr. byrne says_0 fireman_'s fund will_probably pay hundreds_of millions in primary claims , but , after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines , the company 's fourthquarter charge_against earnings should n't top $ 50_million . the company was able_to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of northern_california showing the exact locations of all the property 0 it insures . fireman_'s fund had claims adjusters on the streets of san_francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot . fireman_'s fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the bay_area . in_addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage , the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut_down by lack_of power or phone service . but many californians may_not have adequate insurance coverage 0 to pay for damages to their property . the independent insurance agents of america says_0 fewer_than one of every five california homeowners has earthquake_insurance . a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the bay_area have bought the additional insurance protection , but the great majority are n't covered . earthquake_insurance typically runs $_200 or more a year for a small house . whatever the long-term economic effect , the scene from the helicopter above oakland is one of tragedy . gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have_been heaved about like plastic building blocks . atop them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a terrifying scramble to safety the day before . in areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say_0 have_been flattened into foot-thick slabs . on the periphery , rescue workers seem , from the air , to move in slow motion . they peck away at the 1 1\/2-mile section of rubble , searching_for more of the 250 people thought to have died here . about 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake . the heart of the earthquake , 6.9 on the richter_scale , was 50 miles to the south , near santa_cruz , but its terrible fist struck here on the nimitz_freeway , a major artery serving the bay_bridge between oakland and san_francisco . along the way , the quake toppled a mall in santa_cruz , knocked down buildings in san_francisco 's fashionable marina_district and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city 's financial_district . just a short span across the bay to the west , the quake also showed its mettle : a four-square-block area of the marina_district lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew . many of the buildings , mostly condominiums and apartments , were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake 's intensive shaking , rupturing gas lines . onlookers say_0 three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly_after the quake struck . efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as_well . from the air , ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site . as onlookers stand behind barricades , helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse . in the marina_district , residents spent yesterday assessing damage , cleaning_up and trying_to find friends and neighbors . evelyn boccone , 85 years_old , has lived in the district most of her life . her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake . `` now , we realize what our mothers must have_gone through , '' she_says . ``_we always heard about the earthquake , but as children we did_n't always listen .
