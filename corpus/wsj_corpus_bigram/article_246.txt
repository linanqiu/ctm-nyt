just five_months after ogilvy group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , kenneth roman , ogilvy 's chairman and chief_executive officer , said_0 he is leaving to take a top post at american_express co . mr._roman , 59 years_old , abruptly announced 0 he will leave the venerable ad_agency , whose largest client is american_express , to become american_express 's executive_vice president for corporate affairs and communications . he will_succeed harry l. freeman , 57 , who has said_0 he will_retire in december . mr._freeman said in_august that he would retire by the end of this_year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker edmond safra . american_express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about mr. safra . the company later apologized and agreed_to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him . although mr._freeman is_retiring , he will_continue to work as a consultant for american_express on a project basis . ad industry_executives were n't surprised by mr._roman 's decision to leave ogilvy . the agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover_attempt by wpp_group plc of london before succumbing in may . and although mr._roman and wpp 's chief_executive , martin sorrell , have_gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each_other , people close to mr._roman say_0 he was unhappy giving_up control of the company . some executives also cite tension because of efforts by mr._sorrell , a financial man , to cut_costs at the agency . mr._roman will_be succeeded as the head of ogilvy 's flagship ad_agency , ogilvy_& mather worldwide , by graham phillips , 50 , who had_been president of north_american operations and who , like mr._sorrell , is british . alexander brody , 56 , will_take on the newly_created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief_executive of its international operations . he had_been president of the international operations . mr._roman also had overseen ogilvy group 's two other units , the scali mccabe sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to wpp . mr._roman appears custom-made for the american_express job . known_as a traditional executive , he is very_much in the conservative american_express mold . moreover , after 26 years at ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help american_express in the wake_of the safra incident . he also is close to american_express 's chairman and chief_executive officer , james d. robinson iii . aside_from working with mr. robinson on the american_express advertising account for about 11 years , mr._roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as mr. robinson . the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation_that mr._roman had_been pushed out of ogilvy 's top spot by mr._sorrell . but mr._roman flatly denied the speculation , saying_0 mr._sorrell had tried several_times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -lrb- the wine , naturally , was seagram 's brand , an ogilvy client -rrb- . `` he asked me not to resign . the implication that i was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' mr._roman said . mr._sorrell , traveling in the far_east , could_n't be_reached . mr._roman said_0 american_express 's mr. robinson first approached him about the job in late_september . according_to industry_executives , peter sutherland , a former european_community commissioner from ireland , was also a serious contender for the american_express job . although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will_be on retainer to american_express as an adviser on international matters . after talking on and off for the past_four weeks , mr._roman said_0 , he agreed_to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and i_think 0 i leave the company in very strong hands . it was my decision , not anyone_else 's . '' mr._roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and mr._phillips , his successor at ogilvy . the two executives could hardly be more different . mr._roman comes across as a low-key executive ; mr._phillips has a flashier personality . during time off , mr._roman tends_to his garden ; mr._phillips confesses to a fondness for , among_other things , fast cars and planes . industry_executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the wpp takeover brought them closer together . ``_i 'm the guy_who made him head of new_york , head of the u.s. , president of north_america , and recommended him -lcb- to mr._sorrell -rcb- as my successor . would i have done all those things successively if i did_n't think_0 he was the right guy ? '' mr._roman asked . he labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part_of the weekend on mr._phillips 's boat in connecticut . mr._roman will oversee american_express 's public_relations and government affairs , among_other things , but he wo_n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units . ``_i consider this a second career , '' he said . he also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives . mr._roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at ogilvy . american_express , kraft_general foods , and mattel executives said_0 the move wo_n't affect their relationships_with the ad_agency . `` general_foods 's relationships_with its agencies are based_on the agencies ' work , and will_continue to be , '' said david hurwitt , a vice_president of kraft_general foods . but some clients and analysts expressed_concern that mr._phillips is n't as well-known to many clients . `` ken was my key contact , '' said j. nicholas hahn , president and chief_executive officer of cotton inc. , which_represents cotton producers . ``_i do_n't know -lcb- mr._phillips -rcb- all that well . i have n't seen or talked to him in several_years . '' and some_analysts questioned whether mr._phillips would_have the skills 0 ogilvy needs to turn the agency around . while the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship new_york office has had a dismal track_record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including maxwell house . ``_i think_0 -lcb- mr._phillips -rcb- is going_to need some help . i_think 0 they need creative leadership , and i_do n't_think 0 they have it , '' said emma hill , an_analyst with wertheim &_co . ogilvy_& mather 's top creative executive , norman berry , left the agency earlier_this year . `` norm berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said ms. hill . but other analysts said that having mr._phillips succeed mr._roman would make for a smooth transition . `` graham phillips has_been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' mr._sorrell , said_0 andrew wallach , an_analyst with drexel_burnham lambert . `` it 's probably a reasonable transition . hopefully , he 'll_be the answer to the problems 0 they_'ve had in new_york .
