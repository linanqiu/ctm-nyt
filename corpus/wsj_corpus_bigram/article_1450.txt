of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real_estate or the signing of a commercial lease . to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more_than negotiate the best purchase_price or lease terms . it must also evaluate the real-estate_market in the chosen location from a new perspective . specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take_advantage of these opportunities . when a regional economy catches cold , the local real-estate_market gets pneumonia . in other_words , real-estate_market indicators , such_as building_permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession . this was seen in the late 1960s in los_angeles and the mid-1970s in new_york . but the reverse is also true : when a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster_than the improving economy . why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ? because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth . metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early_1980s , as the domestic auto_industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment . area employment dropped by 13_% from its 1979 peak and retail_sales were down 14_% . however , the real-estate_market was hurt even more . for_example , residential building_permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level . once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real_estate rebounded . building_permits , for_example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 . where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ? look no further than metropolitan houston and denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation . of course , some observers have touted houston and denver for the past_five years as a counter-cyclical play . but now appears to be the time 0 to act . metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak . in the mid-1980s , employment was down as_much as 5_% from the 1982 peak and retail_sales were off 13_% . the real-estate_market suffered even more severe setbacks . office construction dropped 97 % . the vacancy rate soared more_than 20_% in nearly every product category , and more_than 30_% of office_space was vacant . to some observers , the empty office_buildings of houston 's `` see-through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy . as_usual , the real-estate_market had overreacted . actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six_years . and personal_income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . today , metropolitan houston 's real-estate_market is poised for a significant turnaround . more_than 42,000 jobs were added in metro houston last_year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer_industry . this growth puts houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last_year . and forecasts project a 2.5_% to 3_% growth_rate in jobs over the next_few years -- nearly twice the national average . denver is another metropolitan_area where the commercial_real-estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston . by some measures , metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved in the past_four years . its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . employment is now 4_% higher_than in_1983 . buying income in real dollars actually increased 15_% between 1983 and 1987 -lrb- the most_recent year available -rrb- . the rates of increase , however , are less_than the rapid_growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . in a self-fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real-estate_market all but collapsed in recent_years . housing building_permits are down more_than 75_% from their 1983 peaks . although no_one can predict when metropolitan denver 's real-estate_market will rebound , major public_works projects costing several billion dollars are under_way or planned -- such_as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan_area , and a new regional airport . when denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next_year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan_area whose economic health is not as easy 0 to determine as houston 's or denver 's ? generally , overcapacity in commercial real_estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan_areas as washington , new_york and los_angeles . vacancy rates in the 15_% to 19_% range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic_growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan_areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking_for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . those looking_for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan_areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan_areas should take a short-term -lrb- three-year -rrb- lease and wait for the bargains ahead . mr. leinberger is managing_partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in beverly_hills , calif .
