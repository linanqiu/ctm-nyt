rep. mary rose oakar -lrb-_d. , ohio -rrb- at last_week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the department of housing and urban_development : i_do n't_want to feel guilty representing my constituents . and if i_think that some people -lcb- on hud_secretary jack_kemp 's -rcb- staff are off base in terms in which they_'re evaluating certain things affecting my hometown , i have to tell_you something -- i_'m not_going to take it . i_think that i_'m elected to represent the people that sent me here . and one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area . and if we_'re not ombudsman for our area , we ought_to be thrown out of office . on the other_hand , if we_'re asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on , then that 's a whole different story . but if i_feel that there_are situations where i_'m trying_to get housing for our area -- whatever it happens to be -- and i have to feel that i_ca n't even ask a question , i_'ve got to tell_you , 0 i_think 0 that 's outrageous . . i_think 0 these regulations that would prohibit well-operated programs in areas across this_country would_be wrong 0 to change ... . i_do n't_want to see some guidelines change that 's going_to inhibit my city 's opportunity to use its money .
