they_did n't play the third_game of the world_series on tuesday_night as scheduled , and they_did n't play it on wednesday or thursday either . but you knew that , did_n't you ? they_are supposed_to play the game next_tuesday , in candlestick_park here . the theory is that the stadium , damaged by tuesday 's earthquake , will_be repaired by then , and that people will_be able_to get there . like just about everything_else , that remains to be seen . aftershocks could intervene . but , at_least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side . it may seem trivial to worry_about the world_series amid the destruction to the bay_area wrought by tuesday 's quake , but the name of this column is `` on sports , '' so i_feel obliged to do_so . you might_be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at candlestick at 5:04 p.m. tuesday , a half-hour before game time , when the quake struck . as_soon as the tremor passed , many_people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had_been a novel kind_of pre-game show . one fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where i was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , ``_we arranged that just for you guys ! '' i_thought and , i_'m sure , others did : `` you should n't have bothered . '' i_'d slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near traverse city , mich. , so i was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk_about them . perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and tv reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat . `` it felt like i was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my_own reaction . a women said_0 she saw the park 's light standards sway . a man said_0 he saw the upper rim undulate . i saw neither . dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe_that the disturbance would_be brief and that ball would_be played . ``_i was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where i sat , but i stayed put for 10 or 15_minutes , '' confessed a friend . ``_i guess 0 i_thought , ` this is the world_series and i_'m not gon na wimp out ! ' '' here in the global village , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long . electrical power was out in still-daylighted candlestick_park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful . within a few_minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear . its richter_scale measurement was reported as 6.5 , then 6.9 , then 7.0 . a section of the bay_bridge had collapsed , as had a part_of interstate highway 880 in oakland . people had died . at 5:40 p.m. , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chanted `` let 's play ball . '' no_longer innocent , they qualified as fools . the stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had_been damage of the sort reported by my friend . outside , i spotted two young_men lugging blocks of concrete . `` pieces of candlestick , '' they said . the crowd remained good natured , even bemused . tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , a few feet away , others watched the interviews on their portable tvs . the only frenzy 0 i saw was commercial : booths selling world_series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items . the traffic jam out of the park was monumental . it took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an_additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away . the six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20_minutes earlier in the day took more_than three_hours . at my hotel , the westin , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had_been water damage , but little else . with garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the amfac , had_been hit harder : a large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away . the westin staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets . i fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a chicago cubs jacket . i expected him to say , ``_i told you so , '' but he already was snoring . the journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the world_series seem unimportant . my response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact . should the rest of the series be played at all ? sure . the quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 olympics . that heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it . two ironies intrude . this has_been widely dubbed the bart series , after the local subway line , and the bay_bridge series . flags fly at half-staff for the death of bart giamatti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the bay_bridge lies in ruins . a series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided detroit-over-san diego go of 1984 has_become memorable in the least fortunate way . still , its edge is lost . it now will_be played mostly for the record , and should_be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without `` off '' days . and i will never again complain_about a rainout .
