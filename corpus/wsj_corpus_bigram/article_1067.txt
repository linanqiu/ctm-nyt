why is the stock_market suddenly so volatile ? yesterday , the dow_jones industrial_average did a now familiar dance : it plunged 60.25 points before lunch , with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes . then , it rebounded to finish down only 18.65 points . and those swings paled beside friday_'s 190.58-point_plunge and monday 's 88.12-point recovery . `` it 's madness -- that in an_hour you_can whack off so_much value , ''_says stanford calderwood , chairman of trinity investment_management corp. , boston . and , apparently , it is here to stay . richard bernstein , senior quantitative analyst_at merrill_lynch &_co , says , 0 `` my gut feel is that we_'ll live with those swings for a while . '' there_are many reasons for the market 's jumpiness : new trading vehicles such_as stock-index_futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program_trading ; and crowd psychology . but most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability_to get in and out of the market quickly . prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are employing ways_0 to turn over shares at ever-faster rates and increasingly acting in concert . `` institutions are herding animals , ''_says peter anderson , who_heads the pension-fund management arm of ids financial_services inc . ``_we watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators . like lemmings , we tend_to move in the same direction at same_time . '' and that , naturally , exacerbates price_movements . institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able_to buy and sell big_blocks of stock at an eye-blink . but when they discover that markets are n't_always as liquid as they supposed -- markets jump . on monday , for_instance , howard ward , a principal at scudder , stevens & clark , found that `` you could_n't buy blue-chips at quoted prices without paying up . '' and when many firms had to `` pay up , '' monday 's sudden rally was sparked . trading in futures and options , some people believe_0 , can add to volatility . investors believe_0 they_can can rely_on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock_market without actually selling any stocks ; that is , a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks . these and other modern trading methods `` tend_to promote dramatic shifts in assets , ''_says 0 george douglas , first vice_president at drexel_burnham lambert_inc . `` it 's the idea that what goes in easy can come_out easy '' -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built_into the stock_market . one new investment style called `` asset allocation '' shifts portfolio weightings between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say_0 one is more_attractive . for_instance , first quadrant corp. , an asset allocator based in morristown , n.j. , said_0 it quickly boosted stock positions in its `` aggressive '' accounts to 75_% from 55_% to take_advantage of plunging prices friday . it added another 5_% monday before stocks rallied . when they_did , the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70_% . a classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio_insurance , now widely discredited . before the 1987_crash , an_estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique . the idea was to `` insure '' the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock_prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves . but in october_1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same_time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures_markets . yet even today , institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio_insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets . others are doing `` index_arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price_discrepancies between stocks and futures . unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market_makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . but institutions say_0 wall_street brokerage_firms are less willing_to make markets . brokers do_n't deny that . wall_street traders_say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower_than in the 1970s , securities_firms ca_n't afford to take the risk of buying too_much stock . ``_i think_0 everyone 's a little more leery , ''_says jack baker , head of equity trading at shearon lehman_hutton inc . `` the institutions have driven -lrb- commission -rrb- rates down to the point_where it makes no sense to commit capital , ''_says tom gallagher , senior_executive vice_president in charge of institutional trading at oppenheimer_& co . `` why_should i risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five_cents a dance ? all 0 you_get is risk . '' lack_of liquidity can also result from exchange `` reforms . '' many traders_say that `` circuit_breakers '' put in place to damp volatility after the 1987_crash actually added to volatility when the stock_market plunged friday . the circuit_breakers caused a 30-minute shutdown in trading in standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index futures_contract as the markets were falling . `` with the futures-trading halt , you could only sell stocks '' to cut exposure to the market , says_0 a money_manager . `` it was scary to people thinking that they could_n't get their trades off . '' `` it was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you 0 there_were three doors 0 to exit , '' said one chicago-based futures trader . `` then they said , ` 0 by the way , two of the doors are locked . ' '' the takeover mania also adds to volatility . ual_corp. is a good example . valued as a buy-out target , the airline stock was trading at nearly $_280 a_share . when the deal ran_into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed_at $ 198 yesterday . presumably , ual is now trading closer to its value based_on earnings . by_contrast , traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves . scott black , a value-oriented money_manager who_heads delphi management_inc. , points out that for those_who invest on fundamentals , `` the value of a stock from day to day does_n't change all that much . '' some experts_say 0 markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed . hans stoll , finance professor_at vanderbilt university , says_0 the current volatility in u.s. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such_as options and futures were introduced . ``_i just ca_n't believe_that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , '' he_says . and robert d. arnott , president of asset allocator first quadrant , notes that before friday_'s tailspin , daily volatility on the new_york stock_exchange in recent_weeks had reached `` historically low levels . '' some people tend_to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock_market was lower . john_j. phelan_jr. , chairman of the big_board , asserts that `` 1988 and 1989 have_been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years . '' but the low average volatility 0 mr._phelan is talking_about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past_week . in_addition , sanford grossman , a wharton school finance professor , says_0 volatile jumps in stock_prices will_continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions `` who can_go out and say ` i have a billion dollars of stocks 0 to sell . ' '' some people think_0 the search_for liquidity is fruitless . in 1936 , john maynard keynes wrote that `` of the maxims of orthodox finance none , surely , is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity . '' it leads investors to focus_on short-term price_movements -- `` a game of musical chairs , '' he called it -- rather_than on long-term fundamental valuation . james_a. white contributed_to this_article .
