junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing securities and exchange_commission investigation , a drexel_burnham lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor . all this has cast a pall_over columbia_savings &_loan association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , thomas spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion beverly_hills , calif. , thrift with high-yield_junk bonds . bears have targeted columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk_market . and some investors fault mr._spiegel 's life_style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in columbia 's jet planes . columbia stock recently hit 4 1\/8 , after reaching 11_3\/4 earlier_this year on rumors_that mr._spiegel would take the thrift private . moreover , junk professionals think columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning 0 another markdown could_be coming . but in recent_days , columbia has edged_up , closing at 5 1\/4 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation_that the thrift might restructure . mr._spiegel 's fans say_0 columbia 's southern_california branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets . that 's almost $ 10 of equity for each columbia share , including convertible_preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion . columbia has only about 10 million_common shares in public hands . the spiegel family has 25_% of the common and 75_% of the votes . other big common holders are carl lindner 's american financial , investor irwin jacobs and pacific financial research , though the latter cut its stake this_summer . while many problems would attend a restructuring of columbia , investors say_0 mr._spiegel is mulling such a plan 0 to mitigate columbia 's junk problems . indeed , columbia executives recently told_reporters 0 they_were interested_in creating a separate unit 0 to hold columbia 's junk_bonds and perhaps do merchant_banking . columbia wo_n't comment_on all the speculation . but like other thrifts , it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity . plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so . new rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market_value , then sell the bonds over five_years . that 's why columbia just wrote off $_130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses . but if columbia could keep its junk_bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right . columbia , a longtime drexel client , wo_n't provide current data on its junk . but its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have_been really battered . these were allied stores , western_union telegraph , gillett holdings , sci television and texas_air , though many other bonds in columbia 's portfolio also have lost value . possibly offsetting that , columbia recently estimated 0 it has unrealized gains on publicly_traded equity investments of more_than $_70 million . it also hopes for ultimate gains of as_much as $_300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings . one trial balloon 0 mr._spiegel is said to have floated to investors : columbia might_be broken up , as mellon bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank . but columbia 's good bank would_be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would_be a private investment company , holding some of columbia 's junk_bonds , real_estate and equity investments . some think_0 columbia 's thrift , which now is_seeking a new chief_operating officer , might_be capitalized at , say $_300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a california presence . the thrift surely could_be sold for more_than the value of its equity , financial industry_executives say_0 . meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk_bonds -- and some capital -- might_be spun_off to columbia shareholders , including mr._spiegel , who might then have a new career , investors say_0 . it is n't clear how_much a restructuring would help columbia stockholders . but `` the concept is workable . you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , ''_says thrift specialist lewis ranieri of ranieri associates in new_york . mr._spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on_wall street . few people think_0 mr._spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current_rules would force columbia to become . `` they_are n't really a thrift , ''_says jonathan gray , a sanford c. bernstein analyst . of course , regulators would_have to approve columbia 's reorganization . and some investment_bankers say_0 a restructuring is n't feasible while the sec still is scrutinizing mr._spiegel 's past junk-bond trades . pauline yoshihashi in los_angeles contributed_to this_article . columbia_savings &_loan -lrb- nyse ;
