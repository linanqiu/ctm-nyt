in the hard-hit marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal . some scenes : -- saturday_morning , a resident was given 15_minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life 's possessions . saturday_night she dined in an_emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city 's four-star restaurants . -- mayor_art agnos stands in the glare of television lights trying_to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures . a couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses . at a nearby corner , they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house , oblivious to any danger . a policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away . -- a young woman_who has_been out of town shows up at the marina middle school to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list . she is told 0 she ca_n't enter unless she is accompanied_by an inspector . she bursts into tears and walks away . nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses . the marina rescue center offered a very san franciscan response to the disaster . in_addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone_calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs . the cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast , and for dinner , pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along_with the salmon . `` this has_been a 15-pound earthquake for me , '' said resident joan o'shea , who_works in an acupuncturist 's office . she and some friends are considering offering earthquake_victims free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented oils . she finds the response of marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible . people have_been very respectful of each_other . i_do n't_know if this would_have happened somewhere else . '' out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions . `` it 's so weird to have to decide_what 's really important to you , '' said barbara may . she went first for personal mementos . in post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . '' after being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded . green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything 0 they could within 15_minutes . reds and yellows went about their business with a kind_of measured grimness . some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows . it did_n't help that on saturday , after three_days of sunshine , it rained . `` the guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal_computers , '' said frank fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments . `` the women wanted photo albums , a certain brooch , kind_of sentimental things . '' he showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman . it belonged to her grandfather . some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods . one building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go_back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to_keep sending things down to the lobby . a policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry_out one last load . enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , residents said_0 . one man trying_to remove his car was told by officials to get_out of his garage . when he sneaked back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out . the marina also has_become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may_have fled or become lost during the earthquake . on lampposts along fillmore street , a major marina artery , posters were offering a $_100 reward for a cat lost during the quake . the san_francisco society for the prevention of cruelty to animals also has_been providing medical_care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals . the spca says_0 it has received more_than 100 requests_for foster homes on_behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish . for_example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the marina , did_n't have heat . `` she can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can_be deadly , ''_says daralee konowitch , animalcare services manager for the spca . a warm foster home has_been found .
