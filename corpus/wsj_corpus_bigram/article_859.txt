senate_republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains_tax for individuals and corporations . at the same_time , a small group of senate_democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon . sen. bob packwood -lrb-_r. , ore. -rrb- , the lead sponsor of the gop proposal , said_0 he intends_to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along , particularly this_month 's bill 0 to raise the federal borrowing limit . he gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains_tax cut of some_sort would_be approved this_year , though it probably_wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction_bill . he_added that he_expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal . for individuals , the packwood_plan would exclude from income 5_% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more_than one year . the exclusion would rise five percentage_points for each year 0 the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35_% . the exclusion would_apply to assets sold after oct._1 , 1989 . as an_alternative , he said_0 , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . for corporations , the top tax_rate on the sale of assets held for more_than three_years would_be cut to 33_% from the current top rate of 34_% . that rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15_years . the packwood_plan would also include a proposal , designed by sen. william roth -lrb-_r. , del. -rrb- , that would expand and alter the deduction for individual_retirement accounts . the roth plan would_create a new , non-deductible ira from which money could_be withdrawn tax-free not_only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses . current iras could_be rolled over into the new iras but would_be subject to tax . for their part , the group of democrats are working on a plan that , like the packwood proposal , would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer 0 they_were held by individuals and companies . newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held . an_extra exclusion would_be given to long-held stock in small and medium-size corporations just starting up . no_one in the senate is_considering the capital-gains plan passed by the house . that plan would provide a 30_% exclusion to assets sold over a 2 1\/2-year period ending dec._31 , 1991 . after then , the house measure would boost the tax_rate to 28_% and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation . senators are focusing_on making a capital-gains differential permanent . separately , chairman dan rostenkowski -lrb-_d. , ill . -rrb- of the house_ways and means_committee said_0 he did_n't want the capital-gains_tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit . the current debt limit expires oct._31 . he also urged house and senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction_bill of all provisions that increase the budget_deficit , including the house-passed capital-gains_provision .
