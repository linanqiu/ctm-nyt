lsi logic corp. reported a surprise $ 35.7 million third-quarter_net loss , including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand . in_september , the custom-chip maker said_0 excess_capacity and lagging billings would result in an_estimated $_2 million to $_3 million net_loss for the third_quarter . but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ 43 million pretax_charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing_operations , citing extended weakness in the market as_well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques . `` over the summer months , there has_been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector , our primary market , '' said wilfred j. corrigan , chairman and chief_executive officer . `` in_addition , recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment , at_least until midyear . '' as a result , the company said_0 it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and `` make appropriate reductions '' in operating_expenses . the $ 35.7 million net_loss equals 86 cents_a share . not counting the extraordinary charge , the company said_0 it would_have had a net_loss of $_3.1 million , or seven_cents a_share . a year_earlier , it had profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18_cents a_share . revenue_rose 42_% to $ 133.7 million from $ 94 million . the charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips . related to that decision , the company said_0 it was converting its santa_clara , calif. , factory to a research and development facility . a spokesman_declined to speculate about possible reductions in force . `` this is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they_are suddenly poorly positioned , '' said michael stark , chip analyst_at robertson , stephens &_co . ``_i think_0 the stock is dead money for a while . '' yesterday 's announcement was made after markets closed . u.s. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer . part_of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the u.s._economy .
