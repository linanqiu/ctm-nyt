copper futures sold_off sharply yesterday , influenced by declines in the stock_market and dollar , and a rally in bonds . december copper opened near monday 's close , tried_to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to_settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day . stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price . william kaiser , president of the kaiser financial group in chicago , said_0 the decline was almost_certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock_market , which partly reflected a weakening economy . he said_0 the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing . mr. kaiser said_0 traders could have picked_up signals of an_imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three_weeks ago . but though a weakening economy implies reduced demand , mr. kaiser said that third_world copper-producing countries have n't any choice but to sell copper . they might even step_up sales in a falling market , he said_0 , in an_effort to maintain the flow of foreign_exchange into their treasuries . technically , mr. kaiser noted_that a_lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $_1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking 0 there was support at the $_1.20 level . when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could_n't climb above that level , traders started selling out their positions . betty raptopoulos , senior metals analyst_at prudential-bache_securities in new_york , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature . she said_0 the market hit the $_1.18 level at around 10_a.m. edt where it encountered a large_number of stop-loss orders . more stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ 1.14 , where modest buying was attracted . ms. raptopoulos said_0 the settling of strikes in canada and mexico will have little effect_on supplies of copper until early_next year . she thinks_0 the next area of support for copper is in the $ 1.09 to $_1.10 range . ``_i believe_that as_soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $_1.20 region , '' she_added . she thinks_0 a recovery in the stock_market would help copper rebound as_well . she noted_that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross_national product is due out tomorrow and is_expected to be up about 2.5_% to 3_% . `` if the number is a little better , then copper will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted . ms. raptopoulos noted_that relating economic numbers to specific market_activity is tricky . yesterday , for_example , `` the durable_goods numbers came out for september and the number was down only 0.1_% , '' she said . `` however , if_you exclude defense-related orders then durable_goods were down 3.9_% . i_believe 0 that number reflects a slowing_economy . '' she said_0 copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic_indicators next_tuesday . however , david threlkeld , president of threlkeld &_co. , an international metals company , noted_that so_far this_year copper consumption is way ahead of the same_period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last_year . mr. threlkeld said_0 the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three_months , with declining use being the result . `` but , '' he_added , ``_we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six_years . '' he_noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about 3.5 weeks . he said_0 the normal ratio is five to six weeks . according_to mr. threlkeld , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries . `` it takes three_months to turn copper concentrate into cathodes , '' he said . if there_is n't a recession , he said_0 , ``_we will_be out of copper by the end of march . if there_is a recession that will change the statistical situation . '' he_thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $_1.65 a pound , which was reached last_year . in the past mr. threlkeld has_been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in_anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market . in other_commodity markets yesterday : energy : the attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude_oil futures yesterday in trading on the new_york mercantile_exchange . prices for the u.s. benchmark west_texas intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a_barrel for december_delivery . several analysts and brokers said_0 the petroleum market was ready to rally after two_days of price declines from profit-taking . but an early 80-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average stopped the crude rally cold . the industrial_average recovered to close only 3.69 points_lower , but petroleum futures never shook off the chill . most market_participants said_0 they_were looking to this_week 's inventory statistics from the american petroleum institute to give the market some direction . the report is n't generally available until late on tuesdays . precious_metals : futures_prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading . december gold was up $ 3.20 an_ounce at $ 373.40 ; december_silver gained 5.7 cents to $ 5.1950 an_ounce . january_platinum rose $ 2.30 an_ounce to $ 488.60 . mr. kaiser said_0 there_were no fundamental factors moving these markets . he_noted that two_weeks ago there_were rumors of soviet sales of precious_metals 0 to finance grain purchases , but the sales do_n't seem to have materialized . ms. raptopoulos thought_0 yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock_market and the dollar . `` gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial_markets as it did '' yesterday , she said . mr. kaiser noted_that gold was more_than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday , which is historically high . `` the high ratio reflects the fact_that silver is still regarded_as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said . grains and soybeans_: prices_closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather . the sale to the chinese government of 330,000 metric_tons of wheat under the government 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading monday , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday , said_0 dale gustafson , a futures analyst_with drexel_burnham lambert_inc. in chicago . as for other export customers , the soviet_union is n't expected to be back buying u.s._corn in significant amounts until early_next year , he said_0 . a number_of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for_delivery in march , indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next_year 's first_quarter . cocoa : futures at first continued the rally begun on monday , but then faltered and closed_lower . the december_contract opened just under monday 's close , triggered some previously placed buy_orders just above $ 1,030 a metric_ton , pushing the price to $ 1,040 , and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their_own accounts and by commercial interests . the contract settled_at $ 1,014 a ton , off $ 13 . robert hafer , senior commodities analyst_at kaiser financial group , said_0 monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about 20_minutes after the opening . he said_0 even_though there was arbitrage buying in new_york because of the weak dollar , cocoa fell to relentless pressure_from bearish traders . but he_noted that speculators apparently do_n't believe_0 there_is much more of a decline in store for cocoa . the december_contract reached its life-of-contract low of $ 975 a ton on_oct. 11 ; its lifetime high was $ 1,735 , set in 1988 , and its recent high was $ 1,368 , set in early august . the last time 0 cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974 . but while further modest declines might_be ahead , mr. hafer said_0 it would_be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high .
