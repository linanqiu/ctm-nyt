factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this_fall , machine_tool makers say_0 , but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions_about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry . september orders for machine_tools rebounded from the summer doldrums , but remained 7.7 % below year-earlier_levels , according_to figures from nmtba -- the association for manufacturing technology . domestic machine_tool plants received $ 303 million of orders last_month , up 33_% from august 's $ 227.1 million , but still below the $ 328.2 million of september_1988 , nmtba said_0 . machine_tools are complex machines ranging_from lathes to metal-forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts . `` overall demand still is very respectable , ''_says christopher c. cole , group vice_president at cincinnati milacron inc. , the nation_'s largest machine_tool producer . `` the outlook is positive for the intermediate to long_term . '' september orders for all u.s. producers , in fact , were slightly above the monthly average for 1988 , a good year for the industry . `` aerospace orders are very_good , '' mr. cole says . `` and export business is still good . while some automotive programs have_been delayed , they have n't been canceled . '' `` september was one of the biggest order months in our history , ''_says james_r. roberts , vice_president , world-wide_sales and marketing , for giddings &_lewis inc. , fond du lac , wis . at a recent meeting of manufacturing executives , `` everybody 0 i talked with was very_positive , '' he_says 0 . most say_0 they plan to spend_more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989 . but sales of north american-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual_rate of only six million , down from 7.1 million a year_earlier . and truck_sales also are off more_than 20_% . auto_makers , who began deferring some equipment purchases last_spring , can_be expected to remain cautious_about spending if their sales do_n't pick_up , machine_tool builders say_0 . machine_tool executives are hopeful , however , that recent developments in eastern_europe will expand markets for u.s.-made machine_tools in that region . there_is demand_for state-of-the-art machine_tools in the soviet_union and in other eastern european_countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as_well as the quality of their goods . however , there 's a continuing dispute_between machine_tool makers and the defense_department over whether sophisticated u.s. machine_tools would increase the soviet_union 's military might . `` the commerce_department says go , and the defense_department says stop , ''_complains one machine_tool producer . if that controversy continues , u.s. machine_tool makers say_0 , west_german and other foreign producers are_likely to grab most of the sales in eastern_europe . september orders for machining centers , lathes , milling machines , grinders , boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled_$ 192.9 million , down 28_% from $ 266.5 million a year_earlier , but a 23_% increase from august 's $ 156.3 million , nmtba said_0 . orders last_month for metal-forming presses and other machinery 0 to form metal with pressure surged to $ 110.1 million , a 78 %_rise from $ 61.7 million a year_earlier and a 55_% gain from $ 70.9 million in_august . today 's presses are large and costly machines , and a few orders can_produce a high total for one_month that does_n't necessarily indicate a trend . machine_tool shipments last_month were $ 281.2 million , a 24_% rise from a year_earlier and a 25_% increase from august . shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year , as machine_tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs . u.s. producers had a $ 2.15 billion backlog of unfilled_orders at the end of september . that was up 2.8 % from a year_earlier , even_though orders for the first_nine months of 1989 were down 19_% from the comparable 1988_period . $ 2,057,750,000 . $ 675,400,000 . $ 1,048,500,000 . $ 588,350,000 .
