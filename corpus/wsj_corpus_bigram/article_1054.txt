markets usually get noticed because_they soar or plunge . gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , yesterday achieved what may_be a new level of impassiveness : the most actively traded futures_contracts closed_unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock_market . the settlement prices of the december , february and april gold contracts were even with monday 's final prices . the december 1989 contract , which has the greatest trading_volume , ended at $ 371.20 an_ounce . the other months posted advances of 10_cents to 20 cents an_ounce . according_to one_analyst , bernard savaiko of painewebber , new_york , the stock_market 's ability on monday to rally from last_friday 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going_to fall either -- took the starch out of precious_metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular . yesterday , gold traded within a narrow range . gold tried_to rally on monday but ran_into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more_than a year : selling by gold producers , who_want to fix the highest possible price for their gold . `` december_delivery gold is trading in a range of $ 365 to $ 375 -lcb- an_ounce -rcb- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' mr._savaiko said . `` producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold . '' also , mr._savaiko noted , stock_market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward buying bonds rather_than precious_metals because ``_we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that does_n't make gold and precious_metals attractive . '' jeffrey nichols , president of apms canada , toronto precious_metals advisers , said_0 there_is little 0 to motivate gold traders to buy the metal . `` investors in the u.s. and europe are comfortable_with the actions of the -lcb- federal_reserve -rcb- in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock_market rebound on monday , '' he said . there_is n't any rush on the part_of investors in the west to buy gold , he said_0 . `` they still bear the memory of october_1987 , when they bought gold after the stock_market crashed and ended up losing_money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' mr. nichols said . `` it 's an experience 0 they do_n't want to repeat . '' at the moment gold traders are n't concerned_about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has_been diminishing recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact_on gold . '' dinsa mehta , chief bullion trader for chase_manhattan bank , said : `` there_is little incentive on the part_of traders 0 to sell gold because the stock_market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety ' quality . there_is little incentive 0 to buy gold because if the stock_market goes higher , it may_be just a false alarm . this is keeping the gold traders handcuffed . '' the most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ 370 an_ounce was regarded_as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold , mr. mehta said . ``_i do_n't know_what it means over the long_run , but for the short_term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has_risen over the past_week or so , '' he said . previously , he_noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as_much as possible before selling . mr. mehta observed that the u.s. merchandise_trade deficit , which rose_sharply in_august , according_to yesterday 's report , has_been having less and less impact_on the gold market . `` the dollar has n't reacted much to it , so gold has n't either , '' he said . in other_commodity markets yesterday : energy : crude_oil prices_rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried_to assess action in the stock_market . since stock_market indexes plummeted last_friday , participants in all markets have_been wary . when traders become confident_that the stock_market has stabilized , oil_prices are_expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once_again become the major consideration . crude_oil for november_delivery edged_up by 16 cents_a barrel to $ 20.75 a_barrel . heating_oil prices also rose . november gasoline slipped slightly . sugar : futures_prices rose on a report that cuba may_seek to postpone some sugar shipments . the march contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents . according_to an_analyst , cuba ca_n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later_this year , into early_next year . `` japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar , '' the analyst said . it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said . another analyst noted_that cuba has_been deferring shipments in recent_years . `` to the professionals in the trade it did_n't cause much surprise . the march futures_contract traded as high as 14.24 cents , but could_n't sustain the advance , '' he said . livestock and meats : the prices of cattle , hogs and pork belly futures_contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the friday stock_market plunge would chill consumer_spending , which in turn would hurt retail_sales of beef and pork . the prices of most livestock futures_contracts had dropped_sharply monday . cattle futures_prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef . grains and soybeans_: the prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures_contracts rose amid rumors_that the soviet_union is interested_in buying from the u.s. or south america about 250,000 metric_tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric_tons of soybean meal . traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible u.s. soybean sales because u.s. exports are lagging . since sept. 1 , about 13 million fewer bushels of u.s. soybeans have_been sold overseas than for the same_period last_year . corn_futures prices_rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed .
