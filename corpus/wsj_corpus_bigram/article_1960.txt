efforts by the hong_kong futures exchange to introduce a new interest-rate futures_contract continue to hit snags , despite the support 0 the proposed instrument enjoys in the colony 's financial_community . hong_kong financial_institutions have_been waiting_for interest-rate futures for a long time . the contract was first proposed more_than two_years ago , but shortly afterward , the colony 's markets were hit_hard by the october_1987 global stock crash . the subsequent drive to reform hong_kong 's markets also has embroiled the interest-rate futures_contract . the securities and futures commission , a government watchdog set_up after the 1987_crash to try_to restore confidence and order to hong_kong 's markets , had_been expected to give the contract conditional approval last_week . but regulators this_week said_0 futures-exchange officials still have a way_0 to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions_about the contract . the exchange had forecast that the contract would begin trading by december . but securities regulators now say privately that it is n't likely_to start until the first_quarter of next_year . analysts and financial officials in the british_colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the hong_kong futures exchange , which has never fully recovered from the october_1987 crash . many believe_that without a healthy futures exchange , hong_kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer . in_addition , local banks say_0 the new contract is important in helping them offset their hong kong-dollar exposure . the contract will_be based_on the three-month hong_kong interbank_offered rate , or hibor . it is almost a carbon copy of the chicago_mercantile exchange 's eurodollar contract , which is based_on the three-month eurodollar rate , the rate paid on u.s.-dollar deposits in london banks . if the contract is as successful as some expect , it may do much to restore confidence in futures_trading in hong_kong . `` the contract is definitely important to the exchange , ''_says robert gilmore , executive_director of the securities and futures commission . two_years ago , the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers . after only 17 months , its main contract , based_on the hang_seng index , had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world . -lcb- a futures_contract is an_agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date . in the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures , the instruments are given an underlying cash_value and are settled in cash . -rcb- but in the week following the 1987 stock crash , the exchange verged on collapse , and the stock and futures_markets in hong_kong were closed for four days . only a government-sponsored bailout kept the crisis from swallowing the exchange . trading in hang_seng index_futures remains crippled by the experience . volume for the entire month of september totaled only 21,687 contracts , compared_with a daily_average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987_crash . despite the thin trading , and after two painful years of restructuring , the futures market has_shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests . while asian markets struggled to cope_with the uncertainty caused_by the oct._13 plunge in new_york stock_prices , futures_trading in hong_kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly . that was also the case in the days following the june_4 massacre in beijing , which caused a sharp_drop in hong_kong stock_prices . `` there was no problem at all , ''_says douglas ford , chief_executive officer of the futures exchange . most_important to the contract 's success is the commitment of hong_kong 's big financial_institutions , especially the two leaders , hongkong & shanghai banking corp. and the local subsidiary of britain_'s standard chartered bank_plc . the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract . `` if those two banks are there , then the balance of the banking institutions will_be there , ''_says mr. gilmore , the securities and futures commission official . colony banks have a major stake_in how interest_rates move because of their enormous hong kong-dollar exposure . even_though the currency is pegged to the u.s. dollar , with a fixed exchange_rate of hk$ 7.8 to the american currency , the u.s. and hong_kong economies do_n't always move in lock step , making it difficult to predict where interest_rates in the colony will_go . in early 1988 , when the three-month eurodollar rate was between 7_% and 8_% , the three-month hibor rate was as low as 1 % . just a few_months ago , the three-month eurodollar rate was around 9.5_% , while three-month hibor hit highs above 11_% . the hibor contract `` solves quite a_bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market , ''_says eric cheng , a director of james_capel -lrb- far_east -rrb- ltd. , the hong_kong arm of the british brokerage_firm . despite the initial support expected , trading in the contract is_likely to start slowly . the wounds from the 1987_crash have n't_yet healed , and not all claims_against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those_who bet 0 the hang_seng index would fall -- have_been settled . companies and financial_institutions familiar_with hong_kong remain wary of trading in its futures market . and mr. gilmore cautions that there may_be limits_on how_much the contract can grow because the hong_kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency . he_says 0 the contract will_be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day . exchange officials also point_out that hibor futures were designed for institutions and corporations , not for the type of small individual_investors who were very active in hang_seng index_futures and defaulted in the 1987_crash . mr. cheng says_0 the low margin required for trading futures attracted a_lot of small_investors before the 1987_crash who did_n't realize that their risk was virtually unlimited . `` you_'re not_going to get your taxi drivers and amahs and all that , ''_says rory nicholas , a director for securities company elders bullion & futures ltd . that should_help to inspire confidence , mr. gilmore says_0 . but many bankers remain nervous , especially as the start-up of the contract continues to be delayed .
