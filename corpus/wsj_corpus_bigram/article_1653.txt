secretary of state_baker , we read 0 , decided to kill a speech that robert gates , deputy national_security adviser and a career soviet expert , was going_to give to a student colloquium , the national collegiate security conference . we keep wondering what mr. gates wanted to say . perhaps he might_have cited mr._gorbachev 's need for `` a stable currency , free and competitive markets , private property and real prices '' and other pie-in-the-sky reforms . perhaps he 'd have called for `` a decentralized political and economic system '' without a dominant communist_party . or political arrangements 0 `` to alleviate the grievances and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics . '' why , a bob gates might even have said , `` nor are soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant western credits . '' if mr. gates had_been allowed to say these_things , we would now be hearing about `` discord '' and `` disarray '' on foreign_policy . dark hints would_be raised that parts of the administration hope 0 mr._gorbachev would fail , just as they_were when vice_president quayle voiced similar sentiments . it 's somehow ok for secretary baker himself , however , to say all the same things . in fact , he did ; the quotes above are from mr._baker 's speech of two_weeks ago . so_far as we_can see , there_is no disagreement among mr._baker , mr. quayle , the mr. gates 0 we_'ve read , or for that matter president_bush . they all understand point one : nothing 0 the u.s. can_do will make much difference in whether mr._gorbachev succeeds with perestroika . perhaps mr. gates would emphasize more_than mr._baker the many hurdles 0 the soviet_leader must leap if he is going_to succeed . but everyone agrees that mr._gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his_own system . they_can be relieved only by changing that system , not by pouring western money into it . gatt membership will not matter to donbas coal miners short of soap , nor will a start treaty make any difference to ukrainian nationalists . on the other_hand , so_long as mr._gorbachev is easing his grip_on his empire , everyone 0 we_'ve heard agrees that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him . if a deal can_be made 0 to cut the world 's ortegas loose from moscow , why_not ? we_do n't_expect much good from nuclear-arms control , but conventional-arms talks might demilitarize eastern_europe . there 's nothing in the least contradictory in all this , and it would_be nice to think that washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated , complex view . yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the bush_administration for not `` helping '' mr._gorbachev . so every time 0 a bush official raises a doubt about mr._gorbachev , the washington community shouts `` cold war '' and `` timidity , '' and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out to reply , `` mr._bush wants perestroika to succeed . '' mr._baker seems especially sensitive to the washington ailment known_as beltway-itis . its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate , clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism , and fainting spells when someone writes the word `` controversy . '' as one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the times : `` baker just felt that there_were some lines in the speech that could_be misinterpreted and seized by the press . '' in short , the problem is not intra-administration disagreement , but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail , and its political opponents will ask `` who lost gorbachev ? '' mr._baker may want to_avoid criticism from senate_majority leader_george mitchell , but as secretary of state his audience is the entire free world , not just congress . in any_case , he 's likely_to find that the more he muzzles his_colleagues , the more leaks will pop up all around washington , a lesson once learned by henry kissinger . letting officials express their_own nuances can_be educational . we note that in rome yesterday defense_secretary cheney said that european euphoria over mr._gorbachev is starting to be tempered by a recognition of `` the magnitude of the problems 0 he was trying_to deal_with . '' it is in the western interest to see mr._gorbachev succeed . the odds are against_him , as he himself would no_doubt tell_you . the ultimate outcome depends_on what he does , not on what we_do . even_if the press is ready to seize and misinterpret , these are not very complicated thoughts . surely there_is someone in the administration , maybe bob gates , who could explain them to college students , or even schoolchildren .
