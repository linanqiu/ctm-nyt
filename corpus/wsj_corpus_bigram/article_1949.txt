federal drug regulators , concerned over british reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to human-based insulin , say_0 they_are considering a study 0 to see if similar deaths have occurred here . the united_kingdom reports came from dr. patrick toseland , head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london . in a telephone_interview friday , dr._toseland said_0 the number_of sudden , unexplained deaths of diabetics 0 he had seen this_year was 17 compared_with just two in 1985 . at_least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human_insulin within the past year , he said_0 . dr. solomon sobel , director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the u.s. food and drug_administration , said_0 fda officials have discussed dr._toseland 's findings `` fairly intensively . '' while there have_been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the u.s. , dr. sobel said_0 the fda plans to examine dr._toseland 's evidence and is_considering its_own study here . dr._toseland , a toxicologist , said_0 he was preparing an article for a british forensic medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may_have occurred after human_insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar , which can kill diabetics . the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating , anxiety and cramps . with proper warning , diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food . `` the anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia , '' dr._toseland said . at the u.s. national_institutes of health , dr. robert e. silverman , chief of the diabetes program branch , said_0 no_evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has_been under_way at nih for five_years . however , he said_0 officials conducting the study had n't been looking_for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness . ``_we are now monitoring for it much more closely , '' he said . ``_we do know 0 there_are slight differences in the way_0 human and animal insulins drive_down blood sugar , '' dr. sobel said . the human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster , he said_0 . `` but we_do n't_believe 0 there_is enough of a difference to be clinically significant , '' dr. sobel said . reports of dr._toseland 's findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there . both the british diabetic association and the committee on safety in medicines -- britain_'s equivalent of the u.s. fda -- recently issued statements noting the lack_of hard scientific evidence 0 to support dr._toseland 's findings . on friday , the american diabetes association issued a similar statement urging the six million u.s. diabetics not to overreact to the british report . `` a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used , '' the american association said . the fda already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human_insulin than with animal-based products . eli_lilly &_co. , the indianapolis-based drug manufacturer , dominates the u.s. human_insulin market with its product known_as humulin . lilly is building plants 0 to make the insulin in indianapolis and fagershein , france . in its latest annual report , lilly said_0 humulin sales have_shown `` excellent growth . '' lilly officials said_0 they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human_insulin , but did_n't know if the problem had caused any deaths . dr. leigh thompson , a lilly group vice_president , said_0 the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product . dr._toseland said_0 most of the british diabetics who_died had_been taking a human-based insulin made by novo\/nordisk , a danish manufacturer . none of the diabetics were using lilly 's insulin .
