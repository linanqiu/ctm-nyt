after 20_years of pushing labor proposals 0 to overhaul the nation_'s health-care system , bert seidman of the afl-cio is finding interest from an unlikely quarter : big business . corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care_costs , are beginning to sound like liberal democrats . failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with_respect to government-sponsored national health_insurance , '' arthur puccini , a general_electric co. vice_president , warned 0 earlier_this year . the pocketbook impact of health_benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus . both the afl-cio and the national_association of manufacturers are calling for measures 0 to control rising costs , improve quality and provide care to the 31 million americans who currently lack health_insurance . agreement on these points is a long_way from a specific program , and nobody expects the u.s. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system . but there_are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine . ``_i ca_n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is , ''_says mr._seidman , who_heads the afl-cio 's department dealing_with health matters . because the bush_administration is n't taking the initiative on health issues , business executives are dealing_with congressional democrats who champion health-care revision . `` business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue , ''_says sen._edward kennedy_-lrb- d. , mass . -rrb- . `` it 's a bottom-line issue . '' business complained earlier_this year when sen. kennedy introduced a bill that would_require employers to provide a minimum level of health_insurance to workers but does_n't contain cost-control measures . partly in response , a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan 0 to attract broader support . it will feature a cost-containment provision designed to_keep expanded benefits from fueling higher care prices . at 11.1 % of gross_national product , u.s. health costs already are the highest in the world . by_contrast , japan 's equal 6.7_% of gnp , a nation_'s total output of goods and services . management and labor worry_that the gap makes u.s. companies less competitive . chrysler_corp. estimates that health costs add $_700 to the price of each of its cars , about $_300 to $_500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health . `` the cost of health_care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength , ''_complains walter maher , a chrysler health-and-benefits specialist . labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums , deductibles and co-payments to deflect surging medical costs to workers . health_benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against pittston co. and nynex corp . in their new contract this_year , american_telephone &_telegraph co. and the communications workers of america agreed_to look for `` prompt and lasting national solutions '' to rising health-care_costs . some_analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health-care overhaul . carl schramm , president of the health_insurance association of america , scoffs at `` capitalists who_want to socialize the entire financing system '' for health . `` they hope 0 they_can buy some government cost discipline , '' but this is a false hope , mr. schramm says_0 . he asserts that government has done an even_worse job of controlling its health bill than business . so_far neither the bush_administration nor congress is prepared to lead the way toward revamping health_care . the administration lacks a comprehensive health-care policy . congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular catastrophic care act of 1988 , which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage . a bipartisan commission established by congress and headed_by sen. john rockefeller -lrb-_d. , w.va . -rrb- is_scheduled to present new plans for dealing_with the uninsured and long-term care for the elderly by next_march 1 . a quadrennial commission appointed by health and human_services secretary louis sullivan is taking a broad look_at the economics of medicare for the elderly , medicaid for the poor and the health system in general . it is_expected to report next_summer . `` no magic bullet will_be discovered next_year , an election year , ''_says rep. fortney stark -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- but 1991 could_be a window for action . the pressure for change will rise with costs . ``_i think_0 employers are really going_to be the ones 0 to push for major change , ''_says sharon canner , a health expert at nam . any major attempt_to revamp the health-care system is_likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups , particularly the american_medical association , and perhaps from the public as_well , if congress takes steps that patients fear 0 will limit the availability of care . the nam embraces efforts , which both the administration and the medical profession have_begun , to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines . advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures . hhs secretary sullivan estimates that as_much as 25_% of the medical procedures performed each year may_be inappropriate or unnecessary . limiting care wo_n't be easy or popular . `` to slow the rise in total spending , it will_be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services , '' the nam warns in a policy statement . this will `` require us to define -- and redefine -- what is ` necessary ' or ` appropriate ' care . this involves trade-offs and -lcb- it -rcb- cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is ` necessary . ' '' the afl-cio also embraces treatment guidelines . in_addition , it 's toying with an approach that would impose health-expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way_0 to slow health-care spending . at a meeting here on nov._15 , the labor federation plans to launch a major effort to build grass-roots support for health-care overhaul .
