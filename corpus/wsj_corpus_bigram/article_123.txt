next to kohlberg_kravis roberts 's megabillion rjr_nabisco deal , sci television is small fry . but the troubles of sci_tv are a classic tale of the leveraged_buy-out excesses of the 1980s , especially the asset-stripping game . sci_tv , which expects to release a plan to restructure $_1.3 billion of debt in the next day or so , is n't just another lbo that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that . the cable and tv station company was an lbo of an lbo , a set of assets that were leveraged twice , enabling the blue-chip buy-out king henry kravis in 1987 to take more_than $_1 billion of cash out of the com - pany . sci_tv 's buy-out was an ace in the hole for mr. kravis and for investors in kkr partnerships . but it has left holders of sci_tv 's junk_bonds holding the bag , including some heavyweights that kkr might need to finance future deals , such_as kemper_financial services , first executive , columbia_savings &_loan and prudential_insurance co. of america . some junk-holders are said to be considering legal_action against kkr or moves to force sci_tv into bankruptcy_court . and kkr 's majority partner in sci_tv 's buy-out , nashville , tenn. , entrepreneur george gillett , also is said to be very unhappy . sci_tv 's six stations once were part_of storer communications . kkr loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out , then later sold storer 's cable operations at a fat profit . in 1987 , kkr for the second time piled debt onto storer 's tv_stations , selling them for $_1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by kkr and 55%-owned by gillett corp. , which now operates the sci_tv stations . in this second lbo , kkr with one hand took more_than $_1 billion of cash out of the tv company 's assets and moved it into the storer cable operations , making them more valuable in a 1988 sale . -lrb- storer also took $_125 million of junior sci_tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets . -rrb- with the other_hand , kkr put back_into sci_tv less_than 10_% of the cash 0 it had taken out , buying sci_tv common and preferred_shares . so , while kkr today has an_estimated $_250 million sunk in now-shaky sci_tv , including equity and debt , the lbo firm still is $_1 billion ahead on the sci_tv buy-out after taking cash up front . on storer as a whole , kkr racked_up compound annual returns of 60_% in the three_years 0 it owned storer . meanwhile , mr._gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $_100 million in sci_tv if the company ca_n't be restructured . overall , mr._gillett 's holding_company , gillett holdings , is heavily indebted and , except_for its vail mountain resorts , is n't doing very_well . with the tv business falling on hard times in recent_years , analysts_say that if sci_tv had to be liquidated today , it might fetch 30_% less_than in the 1987 buy-out , wiping out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders . meanwhile , sci_tv can barely pay its cash interest bill , and to stay_out of bankruptcy_court it must soon reschedule a_lot of bank_loans and junk_bonds that have_fallen due . sci_tv 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire_nov. 16 . it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt . negotiations `` have started con - structively , but that 's not to say_0 we like this particular offer , ''_says wilbur ross of rothschild inc. , adviser to sci_tv junk-holders . no major player in the sci_tv deal will talk publicly . but it 's understood that mr. kravis is disappointed that mr._gillett did_n't manage to boost sci_tv 's operating_profit after the buy-out . mr. kravis apparently thinks_0 sci_tv can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until tv_stations rise in value again , allowing sci_tv to sell assets to pay debt . mr._gillett is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station . as for junk-holders , they_'re discovering 0 it can_be a mistake to take the other_side of a trade by kkr . the bonds of sci_tv now are_being quoted_at prices ranging_from only five_cents to about 60 cents on the dollar , according_to r.d. smith &_co. in new_york , which trades distressed securities . people_who have seen sci_tv 's restructuring_plan say_0 it offers concessions by kkr and gillett corp . they would both give part_of their combined $ 50_million in common equity in sci_tv to holders of sci_tv 's $ 488 million of junk_bonds , as a carrot 0 to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company . but some militant sci_tv junk-holders say_0 that 's not enough . they contend_that sci_tv 's equity now is worthless . they add that it is n't costing kkr anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out , which they think_0 contributed_to sci_tv 's current problems . kemper , the biggest holder of senior sci_tv bonds , has refused_to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing_its legal options . to_protect their claims , some junk-holders want kkr and perhaps mr._gillett to invest new money in sci_tv , perhaps $ 50_million or more . one investment_banker who is n't involved in the deal says_0 sci_tv needs at_least $ 50_million of new equity to survive . junk-holders say_0 they have a stick 0 to beat kkr with : `` the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool '' 0 to extract money from kkr , says_0 one big sci_tv holder . this could_be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for kkr , he_adds 0 . a big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish kkr 's name , and provide new fuel for critics of lbos in washington and elsewhere . but others say_0 junk-holders have nothing 0 to gain by putting sci_tv into bankruptcy-law_proceedings . while kkr does_n't control sci_tv which is unusual for a kkr investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than mr._gillett . bankruptcy specialists say_0 mr. kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour lbos recently when kkr restructured foundering seaman furniture , doubling kkr 's equity_stake . but with seaman , kkr was only trying_to salvage its original investment , says_0 bankruptcy investor james rubin of sass lamle rubin in new_york . by_contrast , kkr probably has already made all the money 0 it can on sci_tv . and people_who know mr. kravis say_0 he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into sci_tv .
