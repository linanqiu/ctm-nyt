defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can_not determine priorities because it has no strategy . last_april , the new defense_secretary , richard cheney , acknowledged that , `` given an ideal world , we_'d have a nice , neat , orderly process . we_'d do the strategy and then we_'d come around and do the budget . this city does_n't work that way . '' with a five-year defense plan costing more_than $_1.6 trillion , it 's about time 0 we put_together a defense strategy that works in washington . this wo_n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures . as it is , we identify national goals and the threats to these goals , we shape a strategy 0 to counter these threats , we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy , before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces . these procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper , and each year , their end product -- the five year defense plan -- promptly melts away . the graph on the left shows_how this happens -lrb- see_accompanying illustration --_wsj oct._30 , 1989 -rrb- . compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations . the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can_not be_executed because_they assume 0 a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats . strategy , however , is about possibilities , not hopes and dreams . by ignoring costs , u.s. strategists abdicate their responsibility_for hard decisions . that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others : bean counters , budgeteers , and pork-barrelers . these people have different agendas . and as a result -- as the recent vote by the house to undo mr._cheney 's program terminations suggests 0 -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense `` strategy . '' how can we turn this situation around ? reform starts in the pentagon . strategists should_consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process . they ought_to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program . they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets . they would also identify the best_way 0 to add programs , should the budget come in at higher levels . this_kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning . there_is no_reason that it can_not be_done for defense planning . two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action . step 1 cleans up our books . our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money , an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending 0 the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $_100 billion . negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president_reagan 's final budget submission to congress . that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ 45 billion . to make the books balance , as is required by law , somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $ 45 billion . it is known in the pentagon as the `` negative wedge . '' the pentagon argues_that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ 22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it_intends to find in future years and $ 23 billion in an `` above guidance '' management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future . the 1990 plan also assumes 0 inflation will decline to 1.7_% by 1994 . most forecasters , including those in the congressional budget office , assume 0 inflation will_be in excess of 4_% in each of those five_years . at that rate , the defense plan is underfunded by $ 48 billion . by adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate , we arrive at a baseline program costing $_1.7 trillion between 1990 and 1994 . step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national_security . the graph on the right -lrb- which assumes a 4_% rate of inflation -rrb- , places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations -lrb- see_accompanying illustration --_wsj oct._30 , 1989 -rrb- . note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations . step 2 will answer the question : what_happens if these increases do not materialize ? scenario 1 , known_as the `` constant dollar freeze , '' reimburses the pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4_% per year . this scenario has_been the rough position of the u.s. senate since_1985 , and it reduces the baseline by $_106 billion between 1990 and 1994 . scenario 3 , the `` current dollar freeze , '' has_been the approximate position of the house of representatives for about four_years . it freezes the budget at its current_level , and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994 . this reduces the baseline by $ 229 billion . scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the house and the senate ; it splits the difference_between scenarios 1 and 3 , by increasing the budget at 2_% per year . it reduces the baseline by $ 169 billion . finally , scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2_% per year for the next five_years -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion . this can_be thought of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the soviet_union . the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses . they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan --_including the assumptions made , an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations , the impact_on national_security , and the best strategy for working around these limitations . this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions . if , for_example , they choose to_keep the b-2 stealth bomber , they would_have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such_as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels . these trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the b-2 became prohibitive . some may_be tempted to argue_that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous zero-based budgeting -lrb- zbb -rrb- concept of the carter administration . but zbb did_not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff , and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics . anyway , zbb 's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia . a strategic review is fundamentally different . it would_be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions : produce the best_possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could_be used to achieve u.s. goals . it might_be feared that even thinking_about lower budgets will hurt national_security because the door will_be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible congress . this argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the pentagon and congress , and unfortunately , there_is some truth to it . but in the end , it must_be rejected for logical as_well as moral reasons . to say that the pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest ; in other_words , that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to congress -- because it is morally superior . strategy is not a game between the pentagon and congress ; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives . if we_want meaningful priorities , we_must understand the trade-offs 0 they imply before we make commitments . strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events ; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent_with our financial , cultural and physical limitations . mr. spinney is a permanent pentagon official . this is a condensed version of an essay that will appear in the january issue of the naval institute proceedings . the views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the department of defense .
