small_investors matched their big_institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said_0 they_were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock_market . ``_i 'm_not losing faith in the market , '' said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market_plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage_firm . but he 's not so sure about everyone_else . ``_i think_0 on monday the small -lrb- investors -rrb- are going_to panic and sell , '' predicted mr. sullivan , whose investments include amr_corp. 's american_airlines unit and several mutual_funds . `` and i_think 0 institutions are going_to come in and buy ... i_'m going_to hold on . if i sell now , i_'ll take a big loss . '' some evinced an optimism that had_been rewarded when they_did n't flee the market in 1987 . `` oh , i bet 0 it 'll_be up 50 points on monday , '' said lucy crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in lexington , ky . mrs. crump said_0 her ashwood investment club 's portfolio lost about_one-third of its value following the black_monday crash , `` but no_one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . '' at the annual congress of the national_association of investors corp. at the hyatt regency hotel in minneapolis , the scene was calm . some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the u.s. were attending when the market started to slide friday . but robert showalter , an_official of the association , said_0 no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors_' clubs are planned . in fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . ``_we hope to take_advantage of it , '' said john snyder , a member of a los_angeles investors_' club . he has four stocks in mind 0 to buy if the prices drop to the level 0 he_wants . not_everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed_as the cause of friday_'s slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of ual_corp. , parent of united_airlines . marc perkins , a tampa , fla. , investment_banker , said_0 the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number_of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending . there 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders . '' mr. perkins believes , however , that the market could_be stabilized if california investor_marvin davis steps back in to the united bidding with an offer of $_275 a_share . sara albert , a 34-year-old dallas law student , says_0 she 's generally skittish about the stock_market and the takeover_activity that seems to fuel it . ``_i have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she_says 0 , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . '' she and her_husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987_crash , although she still owns some texaco stock . partly_because of concern about the economy and partly_because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , ``_i think at this point 0 we_want to be a_lot more liquid . '' others wonder how_many more of these shocks the small_investor can stand . ``_we all assumed 0 october '87 was a one-time shot , '' said san_francisco attorney david greenberg . ``_we told the little guy 0 it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back . now it 's happening again . '' mr._greenberg got out just before the 1987_crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared . this time he 's ready to buy in `` when the panic wears off . '' still , he_adds : ``_we ca_n't have this_kind of thing happen very often . when the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly . merrill_lynch ca_n't survive without the little guy . '' small_investors have tiptoed back_into the market following black_monday , but mostly through mutual_funds . discount brokerage customers `` have_been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they_were two_years ago , ''_says 0 leslie quick jr. , chairman of the quick & reilly discount brokerage_firm . hugo quackenbush , senior_vice president at charles scwhab corp. , says_0 schwab customers `` have_been neutral to cautious recently about stocks . '' individual_investors are still angry about program_trading , mr. quackenbush says_0 . avner arbel , a cornell university finance professor , says_0 government regulators will have to more closely control program_trading to `` win back the confidence of the small_investor . '' but it 's not_only the stock_market that has some small_investors worried . alan helfman , general sales manager of a chrysler dealership in houston , said_0 he and his_mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry . `` these high_rollers took a big bath today , '' he said in his showroom , which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of houston 's richest citizens . `` and i can tell_you that a high roller is n't going_to come in tomorrow and buy a chrysler tc by maserati . '' and , finally , there_were the gloaters . ``_i got out in 1987 . everything , '' said pascal antori , an akron , ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting chicago and stopped by fidelity_investments ' lasalle street office . ``_i just stopped by to see_how much i would_have lost . '' would mr. antori ever get_back in ? `` are you kidding ! when it comes to money : once bitten , 2,000 times shy .
