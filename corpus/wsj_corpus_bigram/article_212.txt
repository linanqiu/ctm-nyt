international_business machines_corp. unveiled a broad strategy 0 to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : most machines ca_n't talk to each_other . the company unveiled more_than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning . the aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations . manufacturers have already spent so heavily_on automation that they_are one of the computer_industry 's leading revenue sources . but many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has_been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine_tools . ibm 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an_attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where digital_equipment corp. has long dominated and where hewlett-packard_co. has recently gained market share . consultants have said that it will_take a while for all the pieces of the ibm strategy to fall into place , even_though the specific products 0 ibm unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first_quarter . sam albert , a consultant in scarsdale , n.y. , said that in the past ibm has_developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines . he said_0 he_believes 0 ibm 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious_about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology . he said_0 he_expects ibm to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming_months . ibm 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing . rather_than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , ibm is making several_hundred of its_own manufacturing people available to_discuss specific needs . ibm 's manufacturing staff also will_be able_to provide software that ibm has_developed internally and will_be able_to form teams with a customer 0 to jointly solve manufacturing problems . ibm can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help customers on software 0 to deal_with such things as changes in engineering documents . ``_we may_not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said george conrades , ibm 's top marketing official .
