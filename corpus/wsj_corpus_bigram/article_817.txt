michelle pfeiffer ca_n't chew gum and sing at the same_time . but on the evidence of `` the fabulous baker_boys , '' that may_be the only_thing 0 she ca_n't do , at_least when she 's acting in movies . as the tough , slinky lounge chanteuse in `` the fabulous baker_boys , '' ms._pfeiffer sings for herself , and more_than passably well . her susie diamond handles a song the way_0 the greats do , like she 's hearing the way_0 it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating_on matching that internal tone . yet her intensity stops and starts with the music . when she is n't performing for an audience , she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth , and indicates_that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in . like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie , ms._pfeiffer 's susie seems like someone 0 you_'ve seen before , in numerous show-biz stories -lrb- even her name , susie diamond , sounds_like a character 0 marilyn monroe must have played -rrb- . yet nothing about `` baker_boys , '' and certainly nothing about ms._pfeiffer , really is like something from the video vault . steve kloves , the young writer and director -lrb- he is n't_yet 30 -rrb- , has only one produced picture to his credit ; he wrote the screenplay for `` racing with the moon , '' a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s . both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older , someone who does_n't dismiss dreams , but who also has enough experience to see his limits . however , mr. kloves directs his_own material without sentimentality and at its_own eccentric pace ; `` baker_boys '' is both bluesy and funny . he 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched ; for_example , the way_0 susie wows an audience the first_time 0 she sings with the baker_boys . of course , it_does n't hurt that mr. kloves has made up for his lack_of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly_what they_'re doing . much of the picture 's sensuality emerges from cinematographer michael ballhaus 's slyly seductive lens work . after working for years with werner rainer fassbinder , the late german director , and more recently with martin scorsese -lrb- `` after hours , '' `` the color of money , '' `` the last temptation of christ '' -rrb- , mr. ballhaus has_developed a distinctively fluid style . and dave grusin 's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship -lrb- `` feelings '' is a must -rrb- without condescension . though ms._pfeiffer has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great , too . what seemed like a good_idea , to cast the bridges brothers -lrb- jeff and beau -rrb- as the baker brothers , actually turned_out to be a good_idea . anyone_who 's tried_to appear `` natural '' in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end_up looking like a stiff . so it 's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers is n't natural at all , that jeff and beau had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real . when the movie opens the baker brothers are doing what they_'ve done for 15_years professionally , and twice_as long as that for themselves : they_'re playing proficient piano , face-to-face , on twin pianos . they_'re small time in the small time-hotels -lrb- not the best ones -rrb- and restaurants in seattle . yet they do_n't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act . they wear tuxedos most nights , unless circumstances -lrb- a regular gig at a `` tropical '' lounge , for_example -rrb- require them to wear special costumes , like hawaiian shirts . plump beau , looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face , plays the older brother , frank . frank plans the program , takes care of business , and approaches the work like any other job . he 's even able_to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job . he 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs ; the audience sees only the house , and only near the end of the movie . frank grovels a little for the bookers , probably no more or less_than he would_have to if he worked for a big corporation . on his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters . jeff bridges is the younger brother , jack , who fancies himself the rebellious artist ; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs , who climbs down the fire escape . yet jack 's the one who can remember every dive 0 they ever played , and when , and he dutifully shows up for work night after night -lrb- he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last_minute -rrb- . looking leaner than he has in a while , the younger mr. bridges 's jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than frank , who 's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated . he can live with little pleasures . mr. kloves has put_together some priceless moments . these_include jennifer tilly 's audition to be the baker_boys ' girl singer . ms. tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster 's girlfriend on the television show , `` hill street blues . '' here she delivers , especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the `` candy man , '' which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that could_n't be more perfect . -lrb- it matches her voice . -rrb- and ms._pfeiffer 's particular version of `` making whoopee '' -- and the way_0 mr. ballhaus photographs her , from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of marilyn monroe if ms._pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right . video tip : if_you 'd_like to see the first_time 0 michelle pfeiffer sang on screen , and you have a_lot of patience , take a look_at `` grease 2 . '' you_'ll find her there . better yet , check out the emergence of her comic persona in `` married to the mob , '' jonathan demme 's delightful mafia comedy .
