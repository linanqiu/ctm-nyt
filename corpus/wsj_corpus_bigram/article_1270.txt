commodity_futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock_market following its plunge friday . yesterday , the stock_market 's influence at first created nervousness . later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their_own factors . gold , the traditional haven in times of financial_crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving_up some of its gains as the dollar recovered . copper and crude_oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect_on the economy . copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had_been supporting prices appeared to be_solved . crude_oil declined early , but as the stock_market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net_loss . trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines . in chicago , grain and soybean prices_rose slightly . livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial_crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork . in commodity_markets yesterday : precious_metals : futures_prices were moderately higher as gold gave_up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising . silver performed quietly . the spot october gold price rose $_4 to $ 367.30 an_ounce . the more active december_delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 an_ounce at $ 371.20 , after trading as high as $ 374 . december_silver was up 2.3 cents an_ounce at $ 5.163 . platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock_market strengthened . gold was nowhere the spectacular performer 0 it was two_years ago on black_monday . for one_thing , last_friday , precious_metals markets closed before the stock_market went_into its late-in-the-day nose dive , so it could_n't react to it . back on friday , oct._16 , l987 , the stock_market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock_market fell . the october_1987 contract that day rose as_much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as march 1989 , rose as_much as $ 9.60 . on black_monday , oct._19 , 1987 , the october contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the friday advances , before giving_up almost $ 10 of that at the close . yesterday 's october gain of $_4 was miniscule compared_with that . one_analyst , peter cardillo of josephthal &_co. , new_york , said_0 the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical_factors that would_have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock_market . `` what the stock_market did was cause the rise to take_place earlier than it would_have happened , '' said mr. cardillo . there 's a good chance that gold will_retain its gains and rise further , he said_0 . he_expects a drop in interest_rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising . finally , according_to mr. cardillo , the impact of the strong_dollar should_be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise_trade deficit , when the figures_are released today . this would_be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said_0 . energy : worried that friday_'s 190-point stock_market plunge might_be a harbinger of things 0 to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude_oil futures_prices . the u.s. benchmark crude , west_texas intermediate , closed_at $ 20.59 a_barrel for november_delivery , down 30 cents . some_analysts said_0 crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains . but most market observers agreed that friday_'s stock_market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday . until yesterday , futures_prices had_been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will_continue to be strong . the organization of petroleum exporting_countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth_quarter based_on projections of robust demand . so any bearish indicator , such_as friday_'s precipitous drop in the stock_market , sends shivers through the oil markets as_well . indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to friday_'s plummet , futures_prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock_market 's partial recovery yesterday . copper : futures_prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had_been underpinning prices appeared to be_solved . the december_contract declined 3.05 cents_a pound to $ 1.2745 . prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock_market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use . but the recovery in the stock_market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the highland_valley mine in british_columbia was about over , according_to an_analyst . highland_valley is a large canadian producer and principal supplier to japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank . last_week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company . now , the analyst said_0 , only_minor points remain to be cleaned up . `` for all intents and purposes , an_agreement appears to have_been achieved , '' he said . copper inventories in new_york 's commodity_exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons . london metal exchange copper inventories last_week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons . the lme stocks decline was about as expected , but the comex gain was n't . however , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock_market , the analyst said_0 . at one_point in futures_trading , as the stock_market firmed , the december_contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able_to sustain the gain . `` it was simply overbought , '' he said_0 , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices . cotton : futures_prices eased , more in reaction to hurricane jerry than to any influence of the stock_market . the december_contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound , at 74.48 cents . technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said_0 ernest simon , cotton specialist for prudential-bache_securities , new_york . prices_rose sharply friday as the storm approached texas and louisiana , which is part_of the mississippi delta cotton-growing area . however , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late_friday , mr. simon said_0 . that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under_pressure , he said_0 . colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of texas and the northern states of the delta during the coming weekend , mr. simon said_0 . that has n't_yet captured traders ' attention , he_added 0 . sugar : futures_prices declined . the march contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents . at one_point in early_trading the march price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock_market recovered , but the price then fell back . a price-depressing factor , one_analyst said_0 , was that india , which had_been expected to buy around 200,000_tons of sugar in the world market , did_n't make any purchases . india recently bought 200,000_tons and was expected to buy more , the analyst said_0 . another analyst thought that india may_have pulled_back because of the concern over the stock_market . `` india may_have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock_market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower_prices , '' said judith ganes , analyst for shearson_lehman hutton , new_york . at any rate , she_added 0 , `` india needs the sugar , so it will_be in sooner_or later to buy it . '' farm products : the prices of cattle and hog futures_contracts dropped_sharply because traders speculated_that the stock_market plunge friday will linger in the minds of u.s. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand_for beef and pork . the price of the hog contract for october delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents_a pound . the prices of most grain futures_contracts rose_slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock_market was showing_signs of recovering . earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows . a broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures_contracts , apparently to take_advantage of the price dip .
