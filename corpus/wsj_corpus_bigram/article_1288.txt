richard g. sim , the man credited with transforming applied power inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , barry_wright corp . the 45-year-old former general_electric co. executive figures 0 it will_be easier this time . but analysts , while applauding the acquisition , say_0 applied 's chief_executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two_companies . barry_wright , acquired by applied for $ 147 million , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems . the watertown , mass. , company 's sales have_been dormant and its profits have dropped . last_year 's earnings of $_1.3 million , including $ 815,000 from a restructuring gain , were far_below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million . besides spurring barry_wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , mr._sim must pare its costs and product_line . `` the question is how_long it 's going_to take barry_wright to make a contribution , ''_says f. john mirek , an_analyst at blunt ellis loewi in milwaukee . the answer will_help determine_whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr._sim . the butler , wis. , manufacturer went_public at $ 15.75 a_share in_august 1987 , and mr._sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 . strong_earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in_august 1988 . the stock has since softened , trading around $ 25 a_share last_week and closing yesterday at $ 23.00 in national_over-the-counter trading . but mr._sim has set a fresh target of $ 50 a_share by the end of reaching that goal , says_0 robert t. foote , applied 's chief_financial officer , will_require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by applied and continuation of its healthy 19_% rate of return on operating capital . in barry_wright , mr._sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one 0 he faced when he joined applied as president and chief_operating officer in 1985 . applied , then a closely_held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . while profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he_says 0 . mr._sim is confident_that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry_wright as it has at applied . he also professes an `` evangelical '' fervor 0 to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared . mr._sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that barry_wright has_been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors . `` with a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , '' mr._sim says . within about six_months , `` things will_be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts 0 . mr._sim figures 0 it will_be easier to turn barry_wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat . when he came to applied , ``_i did_n't have the power to execute as i_do today , '' he_says 0 . he was_named chief_executive officer of applied in 1986 and became chairman last november . at applied , mr._sim set growth as his first objective . he took the company public in an offering that netted applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program . sales climbed to an_estimated $ 245 million in fiscal_1989 , ended_aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 . the company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent_years , reached about $ 20.8 million , or $ 1.58 a_share , in the fiscal_year just ended , up from $ 15.2 million in fiscal_1988 and $_3.9 million in 1985 .
