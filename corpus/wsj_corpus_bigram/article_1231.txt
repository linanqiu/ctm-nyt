'' the institutions appeared confident_that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if_necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance_ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that . but in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt . at the close , the nikkei average of 225 stocks stood_at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8_% . the broader tokyo_stock price_index sank 45.66 , or 1.7_% , to 2600.88 . the day 's decline was generally in line with analysts_' weekend predictions . declining_issues swamped advancers , 941-105 . but volume_was thin at 526.2 million_shares , compared_with 574.7 million friday . the market opened sharply_lower , with the nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20_minutes . a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low . the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second_section also posted their biggest decline of the year . the tokyo_stock exchange index for the second_section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 . many investors , trying_to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in recent_weeks . japanese_investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did_n't fall more sharply . but its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two_years ago , during the october_1987 global stock_market crash . on_oct. 16 , 1987 -- the friday before the black_monday crash -- the new_york market dropped 4.6_% , and tokyo followed on monday with a 2.4_% drop . this time , wall_street 's plunge of 6.9_% friday was followed_by yesterday 's 1.8_% loss in tokyo . two_years ago , tokyo 's_biggest fall came the day after new_york 's 22.6 % black_monday plunge , when the nikkei average fell 14.9 % . thus , market_participants yesterday were looking_ahead nervously to wall_street 's opening . but in new_york yesterday , the dow_jones industrial_average surged 88.12 to close_at 2657.38 on heavy_volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining_issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market . nobuto yasuda , a director at yamaichi investment_trust & management co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for japan . `` now we are_looking for the time 0 to place buy_orders , '' he said . `` for us institutional_investors , the chance for buying has come . '' isao ushikubo , general_manager of the investment research department at toyo trust & banking co. , also was optimistic . he described friday_'s plunge in the u.s. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity . `` unless there_is a panic , this is the best time 0 to buy , as was the case two_years ago , '' he said . `` those shares which had posted gains on m&a speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there_is n't much impact . '' other fund_managers were similarly sanguine . ``_we have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said masato murakami , chief portfolio_manager in the pension_fund management department at yasuda trust & banking co . he said_0 friday_'s wall_street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that yasuda trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy . among_other asian and pacific markets , malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses , with the kuala_lumpur composite_index in malaysia falling 11.5_% and singapore 's straits times industrial index down 10_% . major indexes declined more_than 8_% in australia and new_zealand and 6.5_% in hong_kong . bangkok , manila , seoul , taipei and jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses . brokers and fund_managers said_0 the region 's markets were reacting to friday_'s wall_street plunge even_though that decline was due to local factors such_as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond_market . `` it 's pure psychology , '' said william au yeung , an account executive for drexel_burnham lambert -lrb- hk -rrb- ltd. in hong_kong . `` markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged_buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no_doubt that asia is still following america 's lead . '' several analysts said_0 malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses because_they are relatively open to rapid cash_flows . hong_kong is the region 's next most open_market , but many foreign_investors have_been staying away_from it since it plunged in june amid political turmoil in china . `` singapore took the hit because when people want to get_out , they tend_to go where the liquidity is , '' said elizabeth hambrecht , a regional analyst_with baring securities -lrb- hong_kong -rrb-_ltd . she pointed_out that even after monday 's 10_% decline , the straits times index is up 24_% this_year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably . similarly , kuala_lumpur 's composite_index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close . in hong_kong , the hang_seng index_fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 . trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared_with 473.9 million friday . but the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four-day closure after the 1987_crash . richard chenevix-trench , a director at hong kong-based baring international fund_managers ltd. , said_0 the market probably has n't hit_bottom yet but is close . `` if new_york does_n't collapse , i see maybe another 5_% on the downside , not counting the risk of bad_news out of china , '' he said . in australia , sydney 's all ordinaries index_closed at 1601.5 , down 8.1_% , its biggest drop since october_1987 . but volume rose only to 162 million_shares from 143 million friday . nestor hinzack , an_analyst at brokerage_firm burdett , buckeridge & young ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` sheep-like '' as investors fled to bluechip australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies 0 they perceived as having any takeover premium built_into the price . london 's financial_times-stock exchange_100-share index , the most closely_watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2_% . at its low , shortly_before wall_street opened , it was off more_than 130 points . the financial_times 30-share_index closed 79.3 points_lower at 1738.7 . volume more_than doubled to 959.3 million_shares from 457.7 million friday . prices on the frankfurt stock_exchange tumbled in heavy_trading . the decline in the german stock index of 203.56 points , or 12.8_% , to 1385.72 was the frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever . retail investors_dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as_much as 20_% . analysts cited memories of two_years ago , when many_small investors held on to their shares after the october crash but the west_german market continued to decline steeply for the next three_months . here are price_trends on the world 's major stock_markets , as_calculated by morgan_stanley capital_international perspective , geneva . to make_them directly_comparable , each_index is based_on the close of 1969_equaling 100 . the percentage_change is since_year-end .
