the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster_than the competition can is clear : your company will benefit in terms of market share , customer satisfaction and profitability . in fact , managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than_ever before . however , for many , managing speed does_not come naturally . `` most of us grew up believing in the axioms ` haste makes waste ' and ` do_n't cut corners , ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed , ''_says dean cassell , vice_president for product integrity at grumman corp . `` but in the real world , you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off . speed is a component of quality -- one of the things 0 we_must deliver to satisfy customers . '' companies that actually market speed as_part of their service train their managers to lead and participate_in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations . managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed , and shift some responsibility_for analyzing , improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees . one team at the federal_express ground operations station in natick , mass. , focused_on a particularly time-sensitive operation : the morning package sort . every morning , tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the natick ground station from boston 's logan airport , carrying the day 's package load . in peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces . the packages must_be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for_delivery , so couriers can_be on the road by 8:35 . no customer is present at the morning package sort , but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction . ``_we 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time , usually 10:30 , '' notes glenn mortimer , a federal_express courier who led the natick team . `` the sooner our vans hit the road each morning , the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation . '' following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout federal_express , members of the natick team monitored their morning routine , carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they_were idle , waiting_for others upstream in the process to send packages their way . ``_we suspected 0 there was downtime built_into our process . but we did_n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering , '' mr. mortimer says . ``_we used the data to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good . '' the team even created a points system 0 to identify those couriers and subgroups that were doing the most 0 to reduce package-sort cycle_time . winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses . `` monitoring shows that the natick team 's new system really does reduce cycle_time for the morning package sort , '' reports james barksdale , chief_operating officer at federal_express . `` the vans leave at_least 15_minutes earlier , on average , than they used to . and service levels have increased to the point_where they_'re consistently above 99 % . '' a cross-functional team at union_carbide 's tonawanda , n.y. , facility , which produces air-separation plants , followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle_time . `` the team included craftsmen from the shop floor as_well as engineering , scheduling and purchasing personnel , '' reports alan westendorf , director of quality . `` first , they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air-separation plant actually gets built . then they identified snags in the process . '' the tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds_of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could_be handled by workers already on the line . the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management . `` the streamlined manufacturing process benefits our_customers in at_least two ways , '' mr. westendorf concludes . `` first , we have better quality assurance than_ever , because the people building the product have_taken on more responsibility_for the quality of their_own work . second , we trimmed more_than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product . '' at grumman 's aircraft systems division , a cross-functional team reduced the cycle_time required to produce a new business proposal for an_important government contract . the team was composed of representatives from engineering , manufacturing , corporate estimating , flight test , material , quality control , and other departments . ``_we needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal , ''_says carl anton , configuration-data manager for grumman 's a-6 combat aircraft program . `` but instead of gathering their input piecemeal , we formed the team , which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work 0 to guide all the functions that were involved . '' armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information , each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal , submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule . ``_we cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly , because the people_who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part_of the task team , '' mr. anton explains . the team trimmed more_than two_months from the cycle_time previously required to develop comparable proposals . `` the team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate . the result was a more thoughtful , complete and competitive proposal , '' mr. anton concludes . the successes achieved at federal_express , union_carbide and grumman suggest_that managing speed may_be an underutilized source of competitive advantage . managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction . they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle_time . and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their_own work . mr. labovitz is president of odi , a consulting_firm in burlington , mass .
