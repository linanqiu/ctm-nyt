the chicago_mercantile exchange said_0 it plans to institute an_additional `` circuit_breaker '' aimed_at stemming market slides . separately , john phelan told a closed house_subcommittee meeting in washington that he would support securities and exchange_commission halts of program_trading during market emergencies . but the new_york stock_exchange chairman said_0 he does_n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program_trading , arguing_that firms could_get around such a limit . the chicago merc said_0 a new one-hour price limit would take_effect in its standard_& poor_'s 500_stock-index futures_pit once s&p_500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average . if the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m . chicago time , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m . with the limit in effect , members would_be able_to execute trades at the limit price or at higher_prices , but not below it . the exchange said_0 it decided 0 a new circuit_breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index_futures on friday oct._13 , when the dow_jones industrials plunged 190_points and stock-index_futures prices skidded as_well . late that afternoon the s&p_500 stock-index_futures contract fell a total of 30 index points , hitting a merc circuit_breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading_session . the merc said that its existing 30-minute , 12-point limit on s&p_500 stock-index_futures trading -lrb- equal to about 100 points on the dow_jones industrials -rrb- , which was_triggered oct._13 , will_remain in effect . leo melamed , merc executive committee_chairman , said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic oct._13 . but when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell_orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated_that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index_futures prices synchronized . several traders maintained that the merc 's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide oct._13 by directing additional selling_pressure to the floor of the new_york stock_exchange . all of the changes require regulatory_approval , which is_expected shortly . the exchange also said that the 30-point circuit_breaker , which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs , will_become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p_500 stock-index_futures contract ; the one-day limit now is 50 index points . a final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract . the merc said_0 that five-point limit will_remain in effect for the first 10_minutes of trading . the limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10_minutes of trading . in washington , house aides said_0 mr._phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program_trades through the big_board 's computer when the dow_jones industrial_average moved 50 points , did_n't work well . he said that firms could_get around the collar by executing trades manually . in a post-hearing news_conference , mr._phelan , who has publicly expressed_concern about market_volatility , said_0 he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing 0 the sec would_be comfortable_with the language '' in a bill . the program-trading issue is heating up on_capitol hill as it is on_wall street , and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile . sec_chairman richard_breeden has said_0 he would_be willing_to consider circuit_breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does_n't want discretionary power to stop programs . a house aide suggested_that mr._phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind_of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come_out feeling good . '' at one_point , mr._phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , rep. edward markey -lrb-_d. , mass._-rrb- , by not_going much beyond what already had_been reported in the morning newspapers . `` markey said_0 we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said_0 . mr._phelan then responded that he would_have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added 0 . at another point during the hearing , rep. markey asked mr._phelan what would_be discussed at a new_york exchange board_meeting today . mr._phelan said_0 the big_board is_likely to study the program-trading issue . that response annoyed rep. markey , house aides said_0 , and the congressman snapped back that there had_been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter . fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably rep._john dingell -lrb-_d. , mich. -rrb- , the full house energy and commerce_committee chairman , who has_been willing_to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent_months . mr. dingell expressed_concern , sources_said 0 , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program_trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades . the futures industry is regulated by the commodity_futures trading commission , which reports to the agriculture committees in both_houses .
