amr_corp. posted an 8.8_% drop in third-quarter_net income and said_0 the fourth_quarter will_be `` disappointing '' as_well , primarily_because of slimmer profit_margins and increased fuel costs . amr 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent_company of american_airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records . some_analysts say_0 the latest results only seem pale by_comparison with a spectacular second_half of 1988 . still , amr 's stumble does_n't bode well for the rest of the industry . the fort_worth , texas , company is generally regarded_as one of the best-run in the business , and its difficulties are_likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter_results over the next_several days . meanwhile , the company 's board , which had said nothing publicly about investor donald_trump 's recently withdrawn $ 7.5 billion offer for amr , issued a statement condemning `` ill-conceived and reckless '' bids and saying_0 it was `` pleased '' that mr._trump had backed out . in the third_quarter , amr said_0 , net_fell to $ 137 million , or $ 2.16 a_share , from $ 150.3 million , or $_2.50 a_share . revenue_rose 17_% to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.33 billion a year_earlier . amr 's chairman , robert_l. crandall , said_0 the results_were due to an 11_% year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield , an industry measure analogous to profit margin on each seat sold . ``_we think_0 these trends will_continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth_quarter as_well , '' he said . tim pettee , an_analyst with merrill_lynch &_co. , said : `` the business turned faster_than expected . costs are giving them a little_bit of trouble , and the whole industry is having a pricing problem . '' for the nine_months , amr 's net_rose 15_% to $ 415.9 million , or $ 6.59 a_share , from $ 360.1 million , or $ 5.99 a_share . revenue jumped 22_% to $ 7.89 billion from $ 6.46 billion . amr 's board , in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday , said : `` ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee , financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of amr shareholders ... . amr has not been , and is not , for sale . '' mr. crandall said_0 the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind_of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult 0 to weather . `` our very disappointing third-quarter_results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth_quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital_base , '' he said .
