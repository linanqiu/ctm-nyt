for 10_years , genie driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient . a high-balance customer that banks pine for , she_did n't give much thought to the rates 0 she was receiving , nor to the fees 0 she was paying . but in_august , first atlanta national_bank introduced its crown account , a package designed to lure customers such_as ms. driskill . among_other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit_card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans . all 0 she had to do was put $_15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify_for a $_10,000 personal line of credit . ``_i deserve something for my loyalty , '' she_says . she took her business to first atlanta . so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these_days . for nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest_rates 0 they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans . the competitive rates were generally offset_by hefty fees on various services . but many banks are turning away_from strict price competition . instead , they_are trying_to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population . `` you_'re dead in the water if_you are n't segmenting the market , ''_says anne moore , president of synergistics research corp. , a bank consulting_firm in atlanta . ncnb_corp. of charlotte , n.c. , recently_introduced its financial connections program aimed_at young adults just starting careers . the program not_only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash-flow statement 0 to help in saving money . in_september , union planters corp. of memphis , tenn. , launched the edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit_card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage_point off on installment loans . the theory : such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years -- and , having borrowed from the bank , they may continue to use it for other services in later years . for some time , banks have_been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings . those efforts are_being stepped_up . judie macdonald , vice_president of retail_sales at barnett banks inc. of jacksonville , fla. , says_0 the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular seniors partners program to various life styles . `` varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' ms. macdonald says . she_says 0 individual barnett branches can add different benefits to their seniors partners package -- such_as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests . `` an active 55-year-old in boca raton may care more about senior olympic games , while a 75-year-old in panama city may care more about a seminar on health , '' she_says . banks have tried packaging before . in 1973 , wells_fargo &_co. of san_francisco launched the gold account , which included free checking , a credit_card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $_3 monthly fee . the concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages . one big reason_: thin margins . many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could_n't target market niches that would_have made the programs more profitable . as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways_0 to cut_costs . but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography . they_are better able_to get to those segments in the wake_of the deregulation that began in the late_1970s . deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions_on what banks can pay for deposits , as_well as opened up the field for new products such_as high-rate cds . where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based_on the size of deposits . the competition has_grown more intense as bigger banks such_as norwest corp. of minneapolis and chemical_banking corp. of new_york extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation . `` today , a banker is worrying_about local , regional and money-center -lcb- banks -rcb- , as_well as thrifts and credit unions , ''_says ms. moore at synergistics research . `` so people_who were n't even thinking_about targeting 10_years ago are scrambling to define their customer_base . '' the competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer . `` the average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial_institutions , ''_says michael p. sullivan , who_runs his_own bank consulting_firm in charlotte , n.c . `` this much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate-sensitive customers costly . '' packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place . for their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely_to move at the drop of a rate . the more accounts 0 customers have , mr. sullivan says_0 , the more likely they_are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it . that can pay_off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers\/investors . packaging has some drawbacks . the additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can_be expensive . chemical_bank spent more_than $ 50_million to introduce its chemplus line , several packages aimed_at different segments , in 1986 , according_to thomas jacob , senior_vice president of marketing . `` it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' mr. jacob says . still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily_because more customers are demanding that financial_services be tailored to their needs . `` these_days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' ms. moore says . some banks are already moving in that direction , according_to alvin t. sale , marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte . first union , he_says 0 , now has packages for seven customer groups . soon , it will split those into 30 . says mr. sale : ``_i think_0 more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department_store , not the boutique .
