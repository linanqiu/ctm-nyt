in a sign 0 the stock slump has n't quieted europe 's takeover fever , cie . financiere_de paribas said_0 it_intends to bid for one of france_'s other large financial and industrial holding companies , cie. de navigation_mixte . paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from french stock_market authorities , it will offer to boost its navigation_mixte stake to 66.7 % from the current 18.7 % . its cash-or-shares bid values navigation_mixte at about 22.82 billion_francs -lrb- $ 3.62 billion -rrb- , making this one of france_'s largest-ever attempted takeovers . the cost of buying the additional 48 %_stake would_be 10.95 billion_francs -lrb- $ 1.74 billion -rrb- . the move would greatly boost paribas 's stake_in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where navigation_mixte is strong . it also would make paribas a major french ally of west_germany 's allianz ag insurance group . allianz holds a 50_% stake_in navigation_mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three_weeks ago . those include rhin et moselle vie and via assurances . long considered a potential takeover_target , navigation_mixte had_hoped 0 allianz would help protect it from raiders . that idea may_have backfired . paribas is allianz 's main french bank , and the munich-based group said_0 it_intends to stay neutral . navigation_mixte said_0 it would n't have any comment until its board meets wednesday . but navigation_mixte is loosely held and hard 0 to defend . `` the defensive options are limited , ''_says philippe braye , a partner in portfolio management concern france finance quatre . `` who would bid against paribas ? '' if the paribas bid succeeds , it will_be the second time in two_months 0 a big french investment_banking group has snapped_up an insurance group . last_month , paribas 's archrival , cie . financiere_de suez , won a battle for groupe victoire , france_'s second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired west_germany 's colonia versicherung ag . that complex bid was billed as france_'s largest takeover ever -lrb- this one is slightly smaller -rrb- . moreover , suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last_year for control of societe_generale de belgique . paribas officials , once considered france_'s toughest bankers , felt abashed at suez 's success and its rapid_growth . although paribas denies it , analysts_say 0 the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between france_'s two largest investment_banking groups . it also reflects the broader pressure_on companies in europe to_keep up as the european_community prepares to reduce internal trade_barriers by 1992 . although paribas chairman michel francois-poncet would n't rule_out eventually selling all of navigation_mixte 's insurance operations to allianz , he stressed the potential for the two_groups instead to cooperate . he also told_reporters 0 the acquisition would_give paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has_been weak . navigation_mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among_others . and navigation_mixte has a huge hidden attraction . payment by allianz for the insurance interests 0 it has just bought will_help swell the french concern 's treasury to an_estimated 11 billion_francs . paribas said_0 it will bid 1,850 francs a_share for navigation_mixte shares that qualify_for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created july 1 , which are eligible_for partial dividends . alternatively , it said_0 it would offer three paribas shares , themselves eligible_for dividends as of next jan._1 , for one navigation_mixte share . paribas shares_closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and navigation_mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid . paribas said_0 it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it . this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed_at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes . some financial sources_said privately that paribas blundered in failing_to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed_up the price . mr. francois-poncet responded that his group initially intended_to take only a minority_stake , striking an alliance_with current management . when notoriously independent-minded navigation_mixte chairman marc fournier rejected paribas 's offer and began buying paribas shares in retaliation , mr. francois-poncet said_0 , he felt obliged to bid for control . he told_reporters 0 he had information that mr._fournier was preparing to buy as_much as 20_% of paribas , up from less_than 5_% currently . a bid against paribas could_n't be ruled out . france_'s second-largest government-owned insurance company , assurances generales de france , has_been building its_own navigation_mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8_% and 10_% . analysts said_0 they do_n't think_0 it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could_n't be_reached .
