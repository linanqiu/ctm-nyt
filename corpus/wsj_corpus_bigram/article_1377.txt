reminiscent of those during the 1987_crash -- that as stock_prices plummeted and trading_activity escalated , some phone_calls to market_makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered . ``_we could_n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said robert king , senior_vice president of otc_trading at robinson-humphrey co. in atlanta . `` it was -lcb- like -rcb- the friday before black_monday '' two_years ago . whether unanswered phone_calls had any effect or not , nasdaq stocks sank far_less than those on the new_york and american exchanges . nonetheless , the nasdaq_composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3_% , to 467.29 . ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . by_comparison , the new_york stock_exchange composite tumbled 5.8 % friday and the american_stock exchange_composite fell 4_% . on_oct. 16 , 1987 , the nasdaq_composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8_% , followed_by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11_% slide , three_days later . nasdaq volume friday totaled 167.7 million_shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so_far this_year . the single-day record of 288 million_shares was set on_oct. 21 , `` there was n't a_lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said e.e. `` buzzy '' geduld , president of herzog , heine , geduld , a new_york company that makes markets in thousands_of otc issues . most of the complaints about unanswered phone_calls came from regional brokers rather_than individual_investors . mr. king of robinson-humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe_0 the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather_than a deliberate attempt_to avoid making trades . the subject is a sore one for nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two_years ago following complaints from investors who could_n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . peter dapuzzo , head of retail equity trading at shearson_lehman hutton , declared : 0 `` it was the last hour of trading on a friday . there_were too_many phones ringing and too_many things happening to expect market_makers to be as efficient as robots . it was n't intentional , we were all busy . '' james tarantino , head of otc_trading at hambrecht_& quist in san_francisco , said , 0 `` it was just like two_years ago . everybody was trying_to do the same_thing at the same_time . '' jeremiah mullins , the otc_trading chief at dean_witter reynolds in new_york , said proudly that his company executed every order 0 it received by the close of trading . but , he_added 0 , `` you_can only take one call at a time . '' market_makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . on days like friday , that means 0 they must buy shares from sellers when no_one else is willing_to . when selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . two_years ago , faced_with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market_makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in otc stock_prices . on friday , some market_makers were selling again , traders_said 0 . but , with profits sagging on_wall street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . mr. tarantino of hambrecht_& quist said_0 some prices_fell without trades taking_place , as market_makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . `` everyone was hitting everyone_else 's bid , '' he said . so , while otc companies incurred losses on friday , trading officials said_0 the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . `` two_years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . i_do n't_know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said mr. king of robinson-humphrey . tony cecin , head of equity trading at piper , jaffray & hopwood in minneapolis , said that piper jaffray actually made money on friday . it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two_years ago , he said_0 . joseph hardiman , president of the national_association of securities_dealers , which_oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . '' `` the pace of trading was orderly , '' he said . nasdaq 's small order execution system `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according_to mr. hardiman . nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock_prices undoubtedly will shake many investors_' confidence . in the past , the otc_market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation . because nasdaq 's trading_volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and otc_market officials hope 0 the damage wo_n't be permanent . but they_are worried . ``_we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented mr. mullins of dean_witter . more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock_prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support 0 the otc_market was struggling to rebuild in the wake_of the october_1987 crash . mr. cecin of piper jaffray says_0 some action from government policy_makers would allay investor fears . it wo_n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he_says 0 . the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc_market -- big and small institutional_investors , as_well as individual_investors and market_makers . but grateful traders_said 0 the sell_orders generally ranged_from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared_with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two_years ago . shearson 's mr._dapuzzo said_0 retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to bargain-hunt . institutional_investors , which had_been selling stock throughout last_week to lock in handsome gains made through the third_quarter , were calmer . ``_we had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as_much panic , '' mr._dapuzzo said . `` if_they could_n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' in_addition , he said_0 , some bigger institutional_investors placed bids to buy some otc_stocks whose prices were beaten down . in_addition , mr._dapuzzo said_0 computer-guided program selling of otc_stocks in the russell index of 2000 small stocks and the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market . nasdaq 's_biggest stocks were hammered . the nasdaq_100 index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big otc technology issues , tumbled 4.2_% , or 19.76 , to 449.33 . the nasdaq_financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped_2 % , or 9.31 , to 462.98 . the otc_market has only a_handful of takeover-related stocks . but they fell_sharply . mccaw_cellular communications , for_instance , has offered to buy lin_broadcasting as_well as metromedia 's new_york city cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular . mccaw lost 8_% , or 3_1\/2 , to 40 . lin_broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5_% , to 107 1\/2 . the turnover in both issues was roughly normal . on a day when negative takeover-related news did_n't sit well with investors , commercial intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said_0 haas & partners advised it that it_does n't plan to_pursue its previously_reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company . commercial intertech plummeted 6 to 26 . the issues of companies with ties to the junk_bond market also tumbled friday . on the otc_market , first executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 . among_other otc issues , intel , dropped_2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; laidlaw transportation lost_1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the american_depositary receipts of jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; mci_communications slipped 2_1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; apple_computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and nike dropped_2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 .
