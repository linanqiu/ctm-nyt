boston co. , the upper-crust financial_services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late_last year , has had a sharp_drop in profitability -- mainly_because a high-risk bet on interest_rates backfired . boston co. 's fall from grace is bad_news for its parent , shearson_lehman hutton holdings_inc. , which has relied heavily_on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent_years . in 1988 , for_example , boston co. had an_estimated pretax_profit of at_least $_110 million , while shearson managed net_income of just $ 96 million . shearson does_n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries . but people_familiar with boston co. 's performance say_0 the unit had profit of around $ 17 million for the third_quarter , after barely breaking even for the first_six months . shearson , meanwhile , posted_net income of $_106 million for the first_nine months of the year , down slightly from $_110 million for the year-ago_period . moody_'s investors_service inc. last_week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of boston co. 's boston safe deposit &_trust co. subsidiary , to single-a-1 from double-a-3 , citing problems in the company 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio . '' john kriz , a moody_'s vice_president , said_0 boston safe deposit 's performance has_been hurt this_year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities . the mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late_last year and continuing into this_year -- `` it cost them , '' mr. kriz said_0 . mr. kriz noted_that boston safe deposit `` has_taken some actions to better control asset-liability management and improve controls in general , and we_think 0 these will serve to improve credit quality . '' as some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested , the problems ought_to ease , he said_0 . but he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled new_england real_estate market . boston co. officials_declined to comment_on moody_'s action or on the unit 's financial performance this_year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three_quarters ' results . an accounting controversy at the end of last_year forced boston co. to admit 0 it had overstated pretax profits by some $ 44 million . the resulting scandal led to the firing of james n. von germeten as boston co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief_financial officer and treasurer . the executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early , in an_effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses . mr. von germeten , in turn , attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused shearson of conducting a `` witch hunt . '' mr. kriz of moody_'s said_0 the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last_year . the company 's current management found itself `` locked into this , '' he said_0 .
