unocal corp. 's decision to put its norwegian oil and gas interests up for sale earlier_this week is another step in the company 's strategic review of its properties , and shows that few of them are sacred cows . the company declined to estimate the value of the norwegian holding . but eugene l. nowak , an_analyst at dean_witter reynolds_inc. , forecast that the sale will bring in `` $_200 million or substantially more . '' the proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the los_angeles-based oil company that has included the $_200 million sale of its_headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its chicago refinery and related marketing operations to petroleos de venezuela s.a . mr. nowak said_0 he attaches particular importance to the proposed sale because it suggests_that the company is willing_to sell oil and gas assets that are n't part_of its major strategic strengths . unocal said_0 it_expects to complete the sale of its unocal norge a\/s unit by next_march or april . in_addition to an 18_% stake_in the veslefrikk offshore field , the norwegian unit has interests ranging_from 10_% to 25_% in three other norwegian oil and gas production licenses . in 1986 , unocal sold a 7.5_% stake_in the veslefrikk field to deutsche erdolversorgungs g.m.b . h. , a west_german oil company , for an_undisclosed amount . in 1987 , it sold a 2.5_% stake_in the veslefrikk field to the swedish national oil company , resulting in a $ 7 million_after-tax gain . however , those sales were early in the field 's history , before production equipment was installed . the field is currently being developed and is slated to start production by the end of the year . it 's expected to produce about 62,000 barrels per day . a company spokesman_said 0 the veslefrikk field 's gross reserves were estimated in 1987 at 229 million_barrels . however , he_added that that estimate , made before extensive development drilling , currently is being reappraised . the spokesman_said 0 unocal has had `` considerable interest '' from prospective buyers . the company has retained j. henry schroder wagg &_co. as financial_adviser and agent for the sale .
