corporate efforts to control health-care_costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases , according_to a study by the institute of medicine . in the last decade , many corporations have embraced the `` utilization_management '' cost containment strategy as a way_0 to control health-care_costs for employees . these programs vary_widely , but often require second opinions on proposed surgery , preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods . between 50_% and 75_% of today 's workers are covered_by such plans , up from 5_% five_years ago . `` although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers , utilization_management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- does_n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care_costs , '' the institute of medicine , an affiliate of the national academy of sciences , concluded after a two-year study . `` employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends . '' while utilization_management frequently reduces hospitalization costs , these savings are often offset_by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative_costs , according_to the report by a panel of health-care experts . the report suggested_that current review programs are too narrow . `` the unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital , and not the actual need for a particular procedure , has_been the main focus , '' the panel said . `` as a general rule , prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care . '' the report said that utilization_management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines . howard bailit , a panel member and a vice_president of aetna_life &_casualty , said that utilization_management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals . `` there 's pretty_good evidence that utilization_management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization , '' he said . but at the same_time , spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed . `` it 's like squeezing a balloon , '' dr. bailit said . david rahill of a. foster higgins &_co. said that clients of his consulting_firm report that utilization_management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5_% , but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole , some of these savings are offset_by administrative and outpatient care costs . jerome grossman , chairman of the panel , agrees that administrative_costs of utilization_management programs can_be high . `` you have a whole staff standing ready '' to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment , he said_0 . dr. grossman , who also is president of new_england medical_center hospitals in boston , noted_that the hospitals 0 he runs deal_with more_than 100 utilization_management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements . the panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity , paperwork and cost of utilization review . `` utilization_management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources , improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers , '' the panel concluded .
