insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused_by this_week 's california_earthquake . getting a grip_on the extent of the damages is proving a far_more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane_hugo ripped through the caribbean and the carolinas last_month . the earthquake 's toll , including possible deep structural_damage , goes far_beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane , says_0 george reider , a vice_president in aetna_life &_casualty insurance_co. 's claims division . but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake , coming so soon_after the hurricane , will_help stem more_than two_years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers . reflecting that logic , insurance-company stocks posted strong gains . aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects 0 to help them assess structural_damage . most insurers already have mobilized their `` catastrophe '' teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern_california . since commercial air travel is interrupted , aetna , based in hartford , conn. , chartered three planes 0 to fly claims adjusters into sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the bay_area . about 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday_afternoon , along_with laptop computers , cellular phones and blank checks . some adjusters , already in other_parts of california , drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could_be used as makeshift claims-processing centers . insurers will_be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims . state_farm mutual automobile insurance_co. , the largest home and auto insurer in california , believes_0 the losses from the earthquake could_be somewhat less_than the $_475 million in damages 0 it_expects to pay out for claims resulting_from hurricane_hugo . state_farm , based in bloomington , ind. , is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake_insurance in california . earthquake_insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement `` rider '' on a homeowner 's policy in california , because of the area 's vulnerability to earthquakes . state_farm said_0 about 25_% of its policyholders in california have also purchased earthquake_insurance . allstate insurance_co. , a unit of sears , roebuck_& co. , said_0 about 23_% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28_% in the san franciso area -- also have earthquake_coverage . the association of california insurance_companies estimated 0 damage to residential property could total $_500 million , but only $_100 million to $_150 million is insured , it said_0 . officials from the american insurance association 's property-claim service division , which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster , will_be flying to san_francisco today . they_expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two . roads and bridges in the bay_area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage . highways , such_as the section of interstate 880 that collapsed in oakland , generally do_n't have insurance coverage . industry officials_say 0 the bay_bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake_coverage , either , so the cost of repairing it probably would_have to be_paid out of state general operating funds . however , the bridge , which charges a $_1 toll each way , does have `` loss of income '' insurance 0 to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more_than seven days . that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance_companies including fireman_'s fund corp. , based in novato , calif. , and cigna_corp. , based in philadelphia . earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial_problems for the insurance industry as a whole . instead , even with the liabilities of two natural_disasters in recent_weeks , analysts said_0 the total capital of the industry is_likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear . indeed , the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways . for_example , insurers may_seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance 0 they buy . such increased demand_for reinsurance , along_with the losses 0 the reinsurers will bear from these two_disasters , are_likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated_into an overall price rise . reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves . ``_we are saying_0 this is the breaking point , this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace , '' said william yankus , an_analyst with conning &_co. , a hartford firm that specializes_in the insurance industry . his firm , along_with some others , issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday . among the insurance stocks , big gainers included american international group , up $ 3.25 to $ 102.625 ; general re corp. , up $_2.75 to $ 86.50 ; aetna , up $ 2.375 to $ 59.50 ; and marsh_& mclennan inc. , up $ 3.125 to $ 75.875 . still , a few individual companies , most_likely smaller ones , could_be devastated . ``_i think_0 there_is a damned good chance 0 someone is going_to hit the skids on this , '' said oppenheimer_& co. analyst myron picoult . he suspects 0 some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover 0 that reinsurance was used up by hurricane_hugo . british , west_german , scandinavian and other overseas insurers are_bracing for big claims from the san_francisco earthquake disaster . although it 's unclear how_much exposure the london_market will face , u.k. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to u.s. catastrophe coverage . jack byrne , chairman of fireman_'s fund , said_0 this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market , causing these rates to soar . the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this_year will_probably be the worst on an_inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the great san_francisco fire . orin kramer , an insurance consultant in new_york , estimates that the 1906 san_francisco destruction , on an_inflation-adjusted basis , included insured losses of $ 5.8 billion . he is estimating 0 this_week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $_2 billion to $_4 billion , following about $_4 billion in costs to insurers from hurricane_hugo .
