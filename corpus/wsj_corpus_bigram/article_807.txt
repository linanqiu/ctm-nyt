two rules in pending congressional_legislation threaten to hinder leveraged_buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as_much as 10_% . wall_street is seething over the rules , which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most lbos . the provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the house and senate , could further cool the takeover boom that has_been the driving_force behind the bull_market in stocks for much of the 1980s , some tax experts and investment_bankers argue 0 . indeed , some investment_bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope_with the expected rules . wall_street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous senate version of one of the provisions . at issue is the deductibility of certain junk_bonds that are used in most lbos . such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face_value , with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder . under current_rules , that accrued_interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt . the house_version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible . the less-rigorous senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five_years . `` you see these in just about every lbo , '' said robert willens , senior_vice president in charge of tax issues at shearson_lehman hutton_inc. in new_york . `` it becomes a source of cash '' for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and does_n't have to repay the debt for several_years . typically , mr. willens estimates 0 , this type of debt makes up 15_% to 20_% of the financing for lbos . these types_of bonds have_been used in buy-outs of companies such_as rjr_nabisco inc. , storer communications_inc. and kroger co . a second provision passed by the senate and house would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting_from lbo debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three_years . for_example , if a company posted a loss of $_100 million from buy-out interest_payments , the existing rule would_allow the concern to be_able to receive a refund from the tax 0 it paid from 1986 through 1989 , when it may_have been a profitable public company . but that rule is being virtually overlooked by wall_street , which is concentrating_on coping_with the deduction issue . `` prices for lbos have to come down if_you do_n't have that feature , '' argued lawrence schloss , managing_director for merchant_banking at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette_securities corp. in new_york . several wall_street officials_say 0 the proposed legislation already is having an impact . an investment group_led by chicago 's pritzker family recently lowered a $_3.35 billion bid for american_medical international , beverly_hills , calif. , because of the threat of the legislation . moreover , one investment_banker , who requested anonymity , said_0 his firm did_n't raise the ante for a target company earlier_this month after a stronger bid emerged_from a public company that was n't concerned_about the financing provision . ``_we would_have paid more if we thought_0 that law was n't going_to pass , '' he said . one possible solution for wall_street is to increase the equity part_of the transaction -- that is , give lenders a bigger stake_in the surviving company rather_than just interest_payments . that would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership . `` the pigs in the trough may_have to give a little_bit of the slop back and then the deal can_go through , '' said peter c. canellos , tax partner at wachtell , lipton , rosen & katz . another solution , said_0 a tax lawyer who requested anonymity , is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount . since they have a lower_interest rate , they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility . the house_version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage_points above treasury notes , has at_least a five-year maturity and does_n't pay interest for at_least one year out of the first five . the bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible . the senate_bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid . currently , even_though the issuer does_n't pay tax , the debt holder is taxed on the accrued_interest . but those holders are often foreign_investors and tax-exempt pension_funds that do_n't pay taxes on their holdings . the senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ 17 million the first year and a total of $ 409_million over five_years . the house_version would raise slightly_more . even_if wall_street finds ways around the new rules , a senate aide contends_0 lbos will_become somewhat more_difficult . `` there 's no question 0 it will make lbos more_expensive , '' he said . `` the interest deduction was the engine that made these_things more productive .
