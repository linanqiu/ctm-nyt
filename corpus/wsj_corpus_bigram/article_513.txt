rep._john dingell , an_important sponsor of president_bush 's clean-air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the white_house on a centerpiece issue : acid rain . the michigan democrat 's proposal , which is_expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the bush_administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain . the administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $_4 billion a year . the proposal comes as a surprise even to administration_officials and temporarily throws into chaos the house 's work on clean-air legislation . as chairman of the house energy and commerce_committee , mr. dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation . people close to the utility industry said_0 mr. dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an_estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could_be ordered later . mr._bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year_2000 . although final details were n't available , sources_said 0 the dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions . that proposal had_been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because_they feared 0 it would limit their growth . it also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters . in_addition , it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills . the administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing . mr. dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee_members , apparently in an_attempt to appease midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing . it is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will_be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the white_house 's acid-rain plan . while the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might_not win the support of utilities , many in the west , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels . lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have_been quietly working with the white_house to devise ways_0 to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns .
