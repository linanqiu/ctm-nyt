senate_democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains_tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal . their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains_cut , which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the house . nevertheless , oregon sen. bob packwood , the ranking gop member on the tax-writing senate_finance committee , last_night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing u.s. aid for poland and hungary . senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- was confident 0 he had enough_votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds , perhaps as_soon as today . mr. packwood all but conceded defeat , telling mr. mitchell : ``_i sense at this stage 0 you may_have the votes . '' the two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion , violating usual senate decorum . their tone was good-natured , with mr. packwood saying_0 he intended_to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and sen._mitchell saying_0 he intended_to use procedural means to block it again and again . although the proposal , authored by mr. packwood and sen. william roth -lrb-_r. , del. -rrb- , appears to have general backing by republicans , their votes are n't sufficient to pass it . and democrats , who are under increasing pressure_from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut , are finding reasons to say no , at_least for now . a major reason is that they believe_0 the packwood-roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long_run . the packwood-roth proposal would reduce the tax depending_on how_long an asset was held . it also would_create a new individual_retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide_variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition . `` a number_of us are not_going to touch capital_gains , iras or anything_else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction , '' said sen. charles robb -lrb-_d. , va. -rrb- , who is one of the 10 to 20 democrats who the bush_administration believes_0 might favor giving preferential treatment to capital_gains . president_bush has_been hearing this_kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past_two days with democratic_senators at the white_house . and at a luncheon meeting tuesday of democratic_senators , there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains_tax this_year , according_to participants . the trend is making advocates of the tax_cut less optimistic about success . `` there_is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this_year , '' said sen. david_boren of oklahoma , a leading democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains_tax . he called the battle `` uphill . '' other democrats who favor a capital-gains_cut are even more pessimistic . `` there will_be no capital-gains bill this_year , '' said sen. dale bumpers -lrb-_d. , ark . -rrb- . ``_i 'm probably not_going to vote for any capital-gains proposal . the ira portion -lrb- of the packwood-roth plan -rrb- is irresponsible . '' another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has_become a purely political battle_between president_bush and senate_majority leader mitchell . mr. mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally . today , sen._mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news_conference to bash the proposal . estimates requested by sen._mitchell from the congressional joint taxation committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an_average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $ 13 million each in 1985 , the last_year for which figures_are available . white_house officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are_reluctant to publicly express support for the packwood-roth capital_gains proposal because_they are loath to buck sen._mitchell . as a result , the officials said_0 they_are open to making a variety_of deals with senate_democrats to win their support for a capital-gains_tax cut . democrats asked in this_week for discussions_with president_bush have suggested ways of `` tinkering '' with the packwood-roth proposal , suggesting an interest in looking_for a modified version 0 they_can back , one official said_0 . in_addition , white_house aides think that there_are numerous other important measures 0 democrats badly wanted passed -- such_as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats . a capital-gains_tax cut might_be paired with such measures to help ensure passage . other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an_increase in the minimum_wage . if_they ca_n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan , administration_officials also are n't ruling out making a deal_with congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even next_year . but the officials insist_that such a deal on a future vote would_have to apply to both the house and the senate . gerald f. seib contributed_to this_article . japanese immigration authorities said_0 they found 658 more chinese
