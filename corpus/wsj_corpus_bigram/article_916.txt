the white_house is making_sure 0 nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly . in the aftermath of the california_earthquake , president_bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday_morning . some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims , but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white_house in action . mr._bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon valdez oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane_hugo struck the carolina coast , and they clearly do_n't want a repeat of those charges now . so the white_house announced that mr._bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff john sununu . by noon , mr._bush had taken two phone_calls from vice_president dan quayle , who was in california ; made a televised statement of concern ; signed a disaster proclamation ; received a written report from the federal emergency management agency ; and visited fema headquarters . mr._bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying_to head_off criticism . on his fema visit , mr._bush said that he hoped 0 there would_be `` less carping '' about the emergency office 's performance this time , adding_that the agency `` took a hit '' for its reaction to hurricane_hugo . the white_house already is talking of mr._bush visiting the california_earthquake site this weekend . he visited the hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do_so .
