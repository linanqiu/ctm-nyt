your_sept. 26 `` politics & policy '' article about william bennett 's emergency drug plan for washington gives the impression that the fbi has not been nor is actively involved . this is not the case . the fbi is very supportive of and an active participant in mr._bennett 's initiative . it was agreed at the outset of the washington drug initiative that the fbi 's role would_be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our national drug strategy . through these investigations we_do not focus_on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market . the trial of raful edmond iii in washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship_with the drug enforcement administration and the metropolitan police department -lrb- mpd -rrb- . the fbi 's role is to complement the d.c. initiative through not_only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes . in fact , we have agents assigned full time to_assist the mpd in drug-related crimes such_as homicide and other crimes of violence . milt ahlerich assistant director office of public affairs federal_bureau of investigation
