when michael s. perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event , more_than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention . mr. perry , who_runs unilever group 's world-wide personal-care business , paused to scan the crowd . ``_i see 0 we have about_half the audience working for us , '' he said , tongue in cheek . `` the other half , we may_have before long . '' members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously ; their industry has_been unsettled recently by acquisitions . first unilever , the anglo-dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $_2 billion to_acquire brands such_as faberge and elizabeth arden . it now holds the no._3 position at u.s. department-store cosmetic counters . then procter_& gamble_co. agreed_to buy noxell corp. for $_1.3 billion . that acquisition , 0 to be_completed by year end , will include the cover girl and clarion makeup lines , making p&g the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets . it 's not so_much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring : p&g and unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear . though it is far from certain that companies best_known for selling promise margarine and tide detergent will_succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt 0 they will shake up the industry . for now , both_companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans . but industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies 0 they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies . likely changes include more emphasis_on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing . but some cosmetics-industry executives wonder_whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business . estee lauder inc. , revlon inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product_development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives . cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several_times a year , and since most products can_be easily copied by competitors , they_'re loath to test them with consumers . `` just because upscale cosmetics look_like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it_does n't_mean 0 they_are packaged goods , ''_says leonard lauder , chief_executive of estee lauder . `` they_'re really fashion items wrapped up in little jars . '' in contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses , unilever and p&g are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits . both_companies are conservative marketers that rely_on extensive market research . p&g , in particular , rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing . both can_be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry_consultants predict 0 cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry_into the field . p&g already_has shown 0 it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business . consider oil of olay , which p&g acquired as_part of richardson-vicks international in 1985 . the moisturizer , introduced in 1962 , had a dowdy image . `` oil of olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women_who had already aged , ''_says david williams , a consultant with new_england consulting group . p&g set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product_line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin . it also redesigned oil of olay 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look . moreover , p&g shifted its ad_campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing `` not to grow old gracefully . '' the company says_0 sales have soared . goliaths like unilever and p&g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals . next_year , noxell plans to roll out a perfume called navy , says george l. bunting jr. , chairman of noxell . without p&g 's backing , noxell might_not have_been able_to spend the estimated $_5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands . packaged-goods companies `` will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive , '' mr. bunting says_0 . further consolidations in the industry could follow . rumors_that unilever is interested_in acquiring schering-plough corp. 's maybelline unit are widespread . unilever wo_n't comment ; schering , however , denies 0 the brand is for sale . the presence of unilever and p&g is_likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics . while the two are among the world 's_biggest advertisers , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads . instead , they focus_on events in department_stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along_with purchases . estee lauder , for_example , spends only an_estimated 5_% of sales on advertising in the u.s. , and mr. lauder says_0 he has no plans to change his strategy . the most_dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new-product development . nearly 70_% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such_as drug stores and supermarkets , according_to andrew shore , an_analyst at shearson_lehman hutton_inc . that figure has_been inching up for several_years . as the trend continues , demand_for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is_expected to increase . this_fall , for_example , l'oreal group , ordinarily a high-end line , rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called plenitude , which retail for $_5 to $ 15 . the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products . unlike the old-line cosmetics houses , unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases 0 to draw on for new products . p&g , in fact , is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition . sales of its tide detergent soared earlier_this year , for_example , after p&g introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics . that 's led industry_executives to speculate that future product_development will_be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands . `` there will_be more emphasis_on quality , ''_says guy peyrelongue , chief_executive of cosmair inc. , the u.s. licensee of l'oreal . `` you_'ll see fewer gimmicks . '' but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business . in the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including colgate-palmolive co. , eli_lilly &_co. , pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies . industry_consultants say_0 only schering-plough , which_makes the mass-market maybelline , has maintained a meaningful business . colgate , which acquired helena rubenstein in 1973 , sold the brand seven_years later after the brand languished . unilever already_has experienced some disappointment . the mass-market aziza brand , which it acquired in 1987 along_with chesebrough-pond 's inc. , has lost share , according_to industry analysts . the ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where unilever is concentrating its efforts , may_prove even more treacherous . in this niche , makeup colors change seasonally because_they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions . because brand_loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned , careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important . and cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more_than $ 15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their_own .
