the only_thing 0 robert goldberg could praise about cbs 's new show `` island son '' -lrb- leisure & arts , sept._25 -rrb- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework . for_instance : `` haole '' -lrb- white -rrb- is not the ultimate insult ; `` mainland haole '' is . richard chamberlain dresses as a `` mainland haole , '' tucking in a hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves . and the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . '' and even_if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear . sorry , the show does_not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color . anita davis
