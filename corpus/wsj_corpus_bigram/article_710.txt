h&r_block is one of the great success stories of u.s. business . oddly enough , this presents a problem for the stock . some money_managers are disenchanted with h&r_block because_they suspect 0 the company 's glory days are past , or at_least passing . block 's tax-preparation business is mature , they say_0 , and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition . it 's no secret that block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business . the street knows all about the predictability of its earnings , which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase . the company has consistently earned more_than a 20_% annual return on its net_worth while many companies would_be happy with 15_% . but the tax-preparation business simply has no more room 0 to grow , says_0 mark cremonie , director of research for capital supervisors inc. , a chicago firm that manages $ 6.5_billion . `` you go to any medium-sized town in the u.s. and you_'re going_to see h&r_block tax services . '' mr. cremonie 's firm once held about 4.8_% of h&r_block . that was before the 1986 tax `` reform '' made taxes more complex than_ever . `` one_thing 0 you_can bet on , '' he_says , `` is that congress will do stupid things with the tax_code . '' but capital supervisors sold the last of its h&r_block holdings earlier_this year . `` they_'re thrashing around for diversification , '' he_says . ``_i think_0 a_lot of their businesses are just so-so . '' last_week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1\/4 before getting roughed up in the friday-the-13th minicrash . it closed_yesterday at 34 3\/4 . to be_sure , the stock still has a_lot of fans . `` if_you invested $_10,000 in the initial_public offering in 1962 , it would_be worth well over $_5 million today , ''_says fredric e. russell , a tulsa , okla. , money_manager . ``_i do_n't know_what the risk is -lcb- of holding the stock -rcb- . taxes are not_going out of business . '' many of his peers feel the same way . the number_of big institutions that own h&r_block shares is 207 and growing , according_to a midyear tally by cda investment technologies . brokerage_houses are sweet on h&r_block , too . zacks investment research counts five brokerage_houses that consider the stock a buy , and four that call it a hold . none dare say_0 to sell it . but some money_managers are doing just that . eugene sit , president of sit investment associates in minneapolis , says , `` when we bought it , we thought_0 the growth_rate was going_to accelerate '' because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds -lrb- the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer , which waits for uncle sam 's check -rrb- . but neither of those developments did much 0 to juice up growth , mr. sit says_0 . he figures 0 block earnings are now growing at about a 10_% annual_rate -lrb- down from about 14_% the past_five years -rrb- and will grow at an 8%-10 % rate in the future . that 's `` not bad , '' mr. sit says_0 , but it sure does_n't justify block shares being priced_at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal_1990 . he_wants stocks whose price\/earnings ratio is less_than their growth_rate ; as he figures it , h&r_block does_n't even come close . two other money_managers , in explaining why they have sold large_amounts of h&r_block stock this_year , spoke on the condition 0 they not be named . `` the stock was going no place and the earnings were so-so , '' said one . -lrb- in the past_two years , the stock almost stalled out . it was above 33 , adjusted_for a subsequent split , in 1987 , and has n't gotten much higher since . -rrb- `` there 's no more growth in the tax business -lcb- except -rcb- for increasing prices , '' the money_manager added . the compuserve subsidiary -lrb- which_provides information to home-computer users -rrb- is `` where the growth is , '' he said_0 , but its format is `` still too complicated . '' compuserve provides about 20_% of both sales and earnings . the tax business still provides about 70_% of earnings , on about 50_% of sales . personnel pool -lrb- temporary workers , mostly in the health-care area -rrb- chips in close to 25_% of sales but only about 9_% of earnings . the shortage of nurses is crimping profit at personnel pool , said_0 the second money_manager . he concedes 0 h&r_block is `` well-entrenched '' and `` a great company , '' but says `` it_does n't grow fast enough for us . we_'re looking_for something that grows faster and sells at a comparable -lcb- price-earnings -rcb- multiple . '' thomas m. bloch , president and chief_operating officer , says_0 ``_i would disagree '' that the tax business is mature . for_example , he_says 0 , the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service , tested in parts of the country , aimed_at taxpayers who_want refunds in a hurry . mr. bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through . ``_we 're still interested -lcb- in diversifying -rcb- , '' he_says , `` but we_'d rather be prudent than make a mistake . '' he also says_0 compuserve 's earnings continue to grow `` 20_% to 30_% a year '' in spite of tough competition_from giants like sears and ibm . and he_says 0 block 's other businesses are growing , although less consistently . h&r_block -lrb- nyse ; symbol:hrb -rrb- business : tax preparation year_ended april 30 , 1989 : revenue : $ 899.6 million net_loss : $ 100.2 million ; $ 1.90 a_share first_quarter , july_31 , 1989 : per-share_earnings : loss of 8 cents vs. loss of 9 cents average_daily trading_volume : 145,954 shares
