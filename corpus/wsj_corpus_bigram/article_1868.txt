the head of the nation_'s largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to `` just say no '' when auto_makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots . in an open letter that will run today in the trade journal automotive news , ron tonkin , president of the national car dealers association , says_0 dealers should cut their inventories to no more_than half the level traditionally considered desirable . mr. tonkin , who has_been feuding with the big three since he took_office earlier_this year , said that with half of the nation_'s dealers losing_money or breaking even , it was time for `` emergency action . '' u.s. car dealers had an_average of 59_days ' supply of cars in their lots at the end of september , according_to ward 's automotive reports . but mr. tonkin said_0 dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30_days to reduce the costs of financing inventory . his message is getting a chilly reception in detroit , where the big three auto_makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders . even_before mr. tonkin 's broadside , some large dealers_said 0 they_were cutting inventories . ford_motor co. and chrysler_corp. representatives criticized mr. tonkin 's plan as unworkable . it `` is going_to sound neat to the dealer except when his 15-day car supply does_n't include the bright red one that the lady wants to buy and she goes up the street to buy one , '' a chrysler spokesman_said .
