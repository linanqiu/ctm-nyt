the house public_works and transportation committee approved a bill that would_give the transportation_department power to block airline leveraged_buy-outs , despite a clear veto threat from the bush_administration . the 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the house floor next_week or the week after . transportation_secretary samuel skinner , in a letter to the committee , warned_that he would urge president_bush to veto the legislation if it passed congress . the senate commerce_committee already_has approved similar legislation . on monday , a letter from mr. skinner 's deputy , elaine chao , said_0 the administration opposed the legislation `` in its present form . '' some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact_that the letter was n't signed by mr. skinner and that it did_n't contain a veto threat . the stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers , especially senior republicans who supported the bill because_they thought_0 the transportation_department favored it . ``_we backed this bill because we thought_0 it would help skinner , '' one republican said , `` and now we_'re out there dangling in the wind . '' a few_weeks ago , mr. skinner testified before congress that it would_be `` cleaner , more_efficient '' if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance . but he never took an_official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already_has enough authority to deal_with buy-outs . under the committee bill , the transportation_secretary would_have 30_days , and an_additional 20 days if needed , to review any proposed purchase of 15_% or more of a major u.s. airline 's voting stock . the secretary would_be required to block an acquisition if he concluded_that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability_to compete , or if it gave control to a foreign interest . although the legislation would_apply to any acquisition of a major airline , it is aimed_at transactions financed_by large_amounts of debt . supporters of the bill are concerned 0 an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt . the panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals , their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock_market . `` it became_apparent in hearings that there ought_to be regulation of leveraged_buy-outs of some_sort , '' rep._james oberstar -lrb-_d. , minn. -rrb- , chairman of the house aviation subcommittee , said during the panel 's deliberations . ``_i do_n't believe_0 in the airline business you_can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public_interest '' at stake . but mr. skinner disagreed , calling the legislation `` a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry . '' in his letter to committee_chairman glenn anderson -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- , the secretary also said_0 the bill `` would_be at_odds with the administration 's policies welcoming open foreign_investment and market allocation of resources . '' currently , the transportation_department does_n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance . however , if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate , the department may revoke its certificate , grounding the airline . such authority is more_than adequate , say_0 opponents of the legislation . but supporters argue_that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it . the panel rejected a proposal pushed by amr_corp. , the parent of american_airlines , to allow the transportation_secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged_buy-out . it also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers .
