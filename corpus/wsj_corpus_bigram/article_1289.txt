no , it was n't black_monday . but while the new_york stock_exchange did_n't fall apart friday as the dow_jones industrial_average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos . some `` circuit_breakers '' installed after the october_1987 crash failed their first test , traders_say 0 , unable_to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . the 49 stock specialist_firms on the big_board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987_crash -- once_again could_n't handle the selling_pressure . big investment banks refused_to step_up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor_traders by buying big_blocks of stock , traders_say 0 . heavy selling of standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index futures in chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward . seven big_board stocks -- ual , amr , bankamerica , walt_disney , capital_cities\/abc , philip_morris and pacific_telesis group -- stopped trading and never resumed . the finger-pointing has already begun . `` the equity market was illiquid . once_again -lcb- the specialists -rcb- were not able_to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new_york stock_exchange , '' said christopher pedersen , senior_vice president at twenty-first securities_corp . countered 0 james maguire , chairman of specialists henderson brothers_inc. : `` it is easy to say_0 the specialist is n't doing his job . when the dollar is in a free-fall , even central banks ca_n't stop it . speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . '' many money_managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday_afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock_market was so quiet . then in a lightning plunge , the dow_jones industrials in barely an_hour surrendered about a third of their gains this_year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9_% , loss on the day in gargantuan trading_volume . final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million_shares , a record for the big_board . at the end of the day , 251.2 million_shares were traded . the dow_jones industrials closed_at 2569.26 . the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the 508-point black_monday crash that occurred oct._19 , 1987 . in percentage terms , however , the dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8_% , a week after black_monday . the dow fell 22.6 % on black_monday . shares of ual , the parent of united_airlines , were extremely active all day friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $_6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group . wall_street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual_stock would rise . at 2:43 p.m._edt , came the sickening news : the big_board was halting trading in ual , `` pending news . '' on the exchange floor , `` as_soon as ual stopped trading , we braced for a panic , '' said_0 one top floor trader . several traders could_be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed . for weeks , the market had_been nervous about takeovers , after campeau_corp. 's cash_crunch spurred concern about the prospects_for future highly_leveraged takeovers . and 10_minutes after the ual trading_halt came news that the ual group could_n't get financing for its bid . at this point , the dow was down about 35 points . the market crumbled . arbitragers could_n't dump their ual_stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock 0 they had . for_example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair_group , which closed_down 3_7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , delta_air lines , which fell 7_3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and philips industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 . these stocks eventually reopened . but as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip_stocks such_as philip_morris and international_business machines to offset their losses . when trading was_halted in philip_morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while ibm closed 5 5\/8 lower at_102 . selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered_by computer when prices fall to certain levels . most of the stock selling_pressure came from wall_street professionals , including computer-guided program_traders . traders_said 0 most of their major institutional_investors , on the other_hand , sat tight . now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the s&p_500 futures_contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the dow_industrials . under an_agreement signed by the big_board and the chicago_mercantile exchange , trading was temporarily halted in chicago . after the trading_halt in the s&p_500 pit in chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big_board , and specialists continued to notch prices down . as a result , the link_between the futures and stock_markets ripped apart . without the guidepost of stock-index_futures -- the barometer of where traders think_0 the overall stock_market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock_prices quoted on the big_board . the futures halt was even assailed by big_board floor_traders . `` it screwed things up , '' said one major specialist . this confusion effectively halted one form of program_trading , stock index_arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock_markets , and has_been blamed by some for the market 's big swings . -lrb- in a stock-index_arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -rrb- `` when the airline information came through , it cracked every model 0 we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing_director at one of the largest program-trading firms . ``_we did_n't even get a chance to do the programs 0 we_wanted to do . '' but stocks kept falling . the dow_industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . at 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . meanwhile , during the the s&p trading_halt , s&p_futures sell_orders began piling up , while stocks in new_york kept falling sharply . big_board chairman_john j._phelan said yesterday 0 the circuit_breaker `` worked well mechanically . i just think_0 it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index_arbitrage would_have helped or hurt things . '' under another post-crash system , big_board president richard grasso -lrb- mr._phelan was flying to bangkok as the market was falling -rrb- was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other exchanges , the securities and exchange_commission and the federal_reserve board . he camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the big_board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders . at about 3:30 p.m._edt , s&p_futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock_markets started to come_back in line . buyers stepped in to the futures_pit . but the build-up of s&p_futures sell_orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again . at about 3:45 , the s&p market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . futures traders_say 0 the s&p was signaling that the dow could fall as_much as 200 points . during this time , small_investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun . at_prudential-bache securities inc. , which is trying_to cater to small_investors , some demoralized brokers thought_0 this would_be the final confidence-crusher . that 's when george l. ball , chairman of the prudential_insurance co. of america unit , took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical . '' ``_i have a hunch that this particular decline today is something ` more ado about less . ' it would_be my inclination to advise clients not to sell , to look for an_opportunity to buy , '' mr. ball told the brokers . at merrill_lynch &_co. , the nation_'s biggest brokerage_firm , a news_release was prepared headlined `` merrill_lynch comments on market drop . '' the release cautioned that `` there_are significant differences_between the current environment and that of october_1987 '' and that there_are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock_market . however , jeffrey b. lane , president of shearson_lehman hutton_inc. , said that friday_'s plunge is `` going_to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it reinforces the concern of volatility . and i_think 0 a_lot of people will harp on program_trading . it 's going_to bring the debate right back to the forefront . '' as the dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss friday , the s&p pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit . jeffrey yass of program_trader susquehanna investment group said_0 2,000 s&p contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million in stock . but there_were no buyers . while friday_'s debacle involved mainly professional traders rather_than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this_morning , traders_said 0 . stock-index_futures contracts settled_at much lower_prices than indexes of the stock_market itself . at those levels , stocks are set_up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures_prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today . the de-linkage between the stock and futures_markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall_street is properly prepared for another crash situation . the big_board 's mr. grasso said , 0 `` our systemic performance was good . '' but the exchange will `` look_at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . obviously we_'ll take a close look_at any situation in which we_think 0 the dealer-community obligations were n't met , '' he said . -lrb- see related story : `` fed ready to inject big funds '' --_wsj oct._16 , 1989 -rrb- but specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987_crash , the `` upstairs '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big_blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during friday_'s blood-letting . mr._phelan said , 0 `` it will_take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling friday .
