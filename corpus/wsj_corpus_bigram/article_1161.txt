korean car exports have slid about 40_% so_far this_year , but auto_makers here are n't panicking . they_are enjoying domestic sales that are more_than making up for lost overseas sales . south_korean consumers are_expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this_year , up 60_% from 1988 . in fact , some auto executives suggest_that slackened demand_for their cars in the u.s. and canada is a blessing ; otherwise they would n't be_able to_keep up with demand in the more profitable local market . ``_we are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus , ''_says hong tu pyo , managing_director of domestic marketing for hyundai motor co . as it is , waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models . demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- hyundai , kia motors_corp. , daewoo motor_co. and even upstart ssangyong motor_co. -- plan to build more factories . industry analysts_predict that by 1995 , south_korea will_be building three million cars a year -- about_half of that for export . it 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity . but south_korean auto_makers are confident_that the export market will bounce_back and that demand in korea will stay strong . currently only one in 38 south koreans owns a car , up from one in 200 a decade_ago . `` in the year_2000 it will_be one car per family . at that point domestic sales will slow_down , ''_says kim yoon kwon , director of marketing for daewoo motor . the reason for the tremendous demand is simple : south koreans suddenly have a_lot more money . ``_we never thought_0 we_'d own a car , ''_says kwang ok kyong , who just bought a daewoo lemans on a five-year loan . she and her_husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as_well as for weekend jaunts . pay raises of 60_% over the past_three years have given many south koreans the money 0 to enjoy the things 0 they_were supplying the rest of the world . the success of newcomer ssangyong motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity . a part_of the construction-oriented conglomerate ssangyong group , it took_over the dying dong-a motor_co. in 1986 . ssangyong began making variations of the jeep-like `` korando '' vehicle . -lrb- dong-a had had a technology agreement_with jeep maker american motors_corp. , now a part_of chrysler corp . -rrb- the most_popular style is the stretched `` family , '' which resembles a ford bronco or chevy blazer . the four-wheel-drive vehicles start at $_15,000 ; a family can cost over $_25,000 . ssangyong , which has only about 3_% of the domestic market , will sell about 18,000 of its models this_year , twice_as many as last_year . it sees sales rising 45_% to 26,000 units next_year . the company plans to_expand plant capacity 50_% by 1991 . by then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based_on the volvo 240 and selling for about $_20,000 . hyundai and daewoo seem unconcerned about the ssangyong threat , but kia , the scrappy no.3 auto_maker , is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its asia unit . it plans to sell 1,700 units in 1989 . kia , the only korean car_maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 , aims at korea 's common man . its advantage has_been the peppy little pride , sold as the ford festiva in the u.s. . at 3.8_million won , or $ 5,700 , the econobox is the lowest-priced car in south_korea . along_with two larger models , the company claims 18_% of the domestic market . ford_motor co. and japan 's mazda_motor corp. have equity interests in kia . kia is the most aggressive of the korean big three in offering financing . loans for as long as five_years make the cars very accessible , with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won , or $ 120 . daewoo motor , a 50-50 joint_venture with general_motors corp. and the daewoo group conglomerate , is the only auto_maker that appears to be hurting . shipments of its lemans to gm 's pontiac division are off about 65_% from a year_ago , versus a 44_% decline for hyundai and an 18_% increase for kia . moreover , daewoo 's domestic sales have_grown half as fast as sales of its rivals . the big problem for daewoo , which_holds about 21_% of the market , is the long series of labor disruptions 0 it suffered this_year . but daewoo is expanding too . in fact , a sister company , daewoo shipbuilding and heavy machinery , plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s . hyundai , the korean market leader with a 58 % share , also plans to jump into minicars at the same_time . it has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year . kia is reportedly also considering such a plan . even giant samsung group is rumored in the korean press to be considering getting_into the auto-making business ; a company spokesman had no comment .
