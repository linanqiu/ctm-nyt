'' mr. baldwin likes the offering . but several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said_0 they_'re staying away_from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class . while they consider the chicago &_north western issue to be good , they do_n't view it as the best . to lure buyers to the

are_expected to have a 14 1\/2_% coupon_rate . the equity arrangement apparently would_allow bondholders to buy a total of 10_% of the stock of cnw corp. , chicago &_north western 's parent_company . donaldson_lufkin declined to comment_on the restructuring . according_to some_analysts familiar_with the negotiations , the 10_% of equity would come directly from donaldson_lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment_bank blackstone group , which would reduce their cnw equity holdings by 5_% each . that would_leave the blackstone fund with a 60_% stake and donaldson_lufkin with 15_%

interpreted by some_economists as a sign that the fed does_n't want the federal_funds rate to move any lower_than the 8_3\/4 % at which it has_been hovering around during the past_week . the closely_watched funds_rate is what banks charge each_other on overnight_loans . it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes . `` the fact_that they_did four-day matched sales means 0 they_are not in a mood 0 to ease aggressively . they_are telling us that -lcb- 8_3\/4 % -rcb- is as low as they_want to see the fed funds_rate , '' said robert chandross at lloyds bank_plc .
