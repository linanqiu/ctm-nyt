the nasdaq_over-the-counter market did_n't fully recover from a selling stampede , and closed_down 1.2_% . the effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market_makers , who watched the nasdaq_composite index tumble in sympathy with the dow_jones industrial_average , and then saw it get left_behind in the subsequent rally . after plummeting 1.8_% at one_point during the day , the composite rebounded a little , but finished down 5.52 , at 461.70 . in contrast , the industrial_average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed_down 0.1_% . the new_york stock_exchange composite was 0.4_% lower for the day . as_usual , the over-the-counter_market 's_biggest technology_stocks were hardest_hit . microsoft , battered by profit taking in recent sessions , sank as_much as 4 ; but it finished_at 80 7\/8 , down 2_1\/4 on volume of one million_shares . mci_communications , the most_active issue , finished down 5\/8 to 42 1\/8 . mci traded as low as 41 3\/8 during the session . other active stocks included jaguar , whose american_depositary receipts added 1\/8 to 11 1\/4 . apple_computer improved 7\/8 to 47 5\/8 ; intel slipped 1\/4 to 33 1\/4 , and valley_national corp. was up 1\/8 to 15 1\/8 . `` the market started with several strikes against it , '' said peter dapuzzo , head of retail equity trading at shearson_lehman hutton , referring_to news that the labor-management_buy-out of ual_corp. continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond_market is disintegrating . but the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter_market , mr._dapuzzo said_0 . even_though the over-the-counter_market usually does_n't fall by as_much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said_0 , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more_than the big_board . '' mr._dapuzzo also complained_that the sharp swings in stock_prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign_investors . while shearson does_n't do computer-guided program_trading for its_own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , mr._dapuzzo acknowledged 0 . the volatility inherent in program_trading troubled other traders , too . they do_n't like the risks 0 they_are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically . market_makers are supposed_to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must_be willing_to buy shares from sellers when no_one else will . in such an environment , a market maker can absorb huge_losses . but the recent_volatility in stock_prices caused_by the program_trading has made some market_makers less willing_to soak up the stocks that are for sale . the market_makers say_0 they_are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because_they realize 0 prices can tumble quickly . the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly , exacerbating the rise and fall in stock_prices during program-dominated trading . groused robert antolini , head of over-the-counter_trading at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette : `` it 's making it tough for traders to make money .
