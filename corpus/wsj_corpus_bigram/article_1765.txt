in the aftermath of the beijing massacre on june_4 , economists advanced wildly divergent views on how hong_kong would_be affected . among the most upbeat was bt brokerage -lrb- asia -rrb-_ltd . in a june 5 reaction , the bankers_trust co._unit proclaimed the economy `` shockproof . '' others were more cautious . in a july analysis titled `` from euphoria to despair , '' w.i. carr -lrb- far_east -rrb- ltd. , another securities_firm , said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic_development . today , with business activity in hong_kong staggering along at an uneven pace , the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear . manufacturers have survived the turmoil in china largely unscathed . signs of revival seem evident in hong_kong 's hard-hit hotel sector . but in the stock and real-estate markets , activity remains spotty even_though prices have regained much of their lost ground . waning demand reported by importers , retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt . as many_economists and businessmen see it , those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely_to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s . that paradox is hong_kong 's economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship_with china . as a model of capitalist efficiency on southern china_'s doorstep , hong_kong 's prospects look good . china_'s land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry . china-bound freight streams through the territory 's port . in the decade since the communist nation emerged_from isolation , its burgeoning trade with the west has lifted hong_kong 's status as a regional business center . these benefits seem secure despite china_'s current economic and political troubles . but to hong_kong , china is n't purely business . it is also the sovereign power that , come 1997 , will_take over this british_colony . china_'s leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 hong_kong . that promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have_fallen back on marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation_'s democracy movement . outflows of people and capital from hong_kong have_been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early_1980s . a widely held assumption all along has_been that , given its robust economy , hong_kong will_be able_to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows . with interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since_june 4 , that assumption no_longer seems so safe . investment and emigration plans take time to come to fruition . only four_months have passed since the beijing massacre , and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact . the only consensus is that more money and people may leave hong_kong than had_been thought likely . this expected blow has cast a pall_over the economy 's prospects . the question , as many_people see it , is how_long such uncertainty will last . maureen fraser , an_economist with w.i. carr , a subsidiary of france_'s banque indosuez , believes that the territory may_not be_able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997 . it may experience an upswing or two in between . but with local investors shaken by china_'s political and economic turmoil , she_says 0 , a genuine recovery may_not arrive until hong_kong can prove itself secure under chinese sovereignty . `` investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic_activity in the runup to 1997 , '' she_says . `` over the next_few years , i would advise caution . '' in a soon-to-be published book on the territory , a political economist , miron mushkat , has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 hong_kong government_officials and businessmen . nearly_half of them argue_that hong_kong 's uneasy relationship_with china will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic_growth . the rest are split roughly between optimists who expect hong_kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos . the interviews took_place two_years ago . since the china crisis erupted , mr. mushkat says_0 , the scenario as 0 depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties 0 hong_kong currently faces . the consensus of this group , which he dubs `` realists , '' is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3_% and 5_% . such a pace of growth , though respectable for mature industrialized economies , would_be unusually slow for hong_kong . only twice since the 1960s has annual gross_domestic product growth here fallen below 5_% for two or more consecutive years . the first instance occurred in 1967-68 , when china_'s cultural revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony . the other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock_market crash . during the past 10_years , hong_kong 's economic_growth has averaged 8.3 %_annually . given hong_kong 's record , mr. mushkat 's `` realists '' might_have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took_place two_years ago . under the current circumstances , he_says 0 , their scenario no_longer seems unrealistic . `` the city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor . it could lose some of its dynamism , ''_says mr. mushkat , a director of baring securities -lrb- hong_kong -rrb- ltd. , a unit of britain_'s barings plc . `` it_does n't have to be a disaster . it just means that hong_kong would become a less exciting place . '' going by official forecasts of gdp , which measures the colony 's output of goods and services , minus foreign income , mr. mushkat 's `` realists '' seem relatively close to the mark . after taking into account the fallout from the china crisis , the government has projected 1989 gdp growth of 5_% . the updated forecast , published aug. 25 , compares_with an earlier forecast of 6_% published march 1 and a 7.4 % rate achieved in sir piers jacobs , hong_kong 's financial secretary , says_0 a further downward revision may_be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally . ``_we are n't looking_at anything like a doomsday scenario , '' he_says . `` but clearly we_'re entering a difficult period . '' many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on hong_kong 's economy . one concerns japanese_investors . barely visible on hong_kong 's property scene in 1985 , by last_year japan had become the top foreign investor , spending $ 602 million . the market has_grown relatively quiet since the china crisis . but if the japanese return in force , their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors_' waning commitment . another -- and critical -- factor is the u.s. , hong_kong 's_biggest export market . even_before the china crisis , weak u.s. demand was slowing local economic_growth . conversely , strong consumer_spending in the u.s. two_years ago helped propel the local economy at more_than twice its current rate . indeed , a few economists maintain that global forces will_continue to govern hong_kong 's economic rhythm . once external conditions , such_as u.s. demand , swing in the territory 's favor , they_argue 0 , local businessmen will_probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing_business as_usual . but economic arguments , however solid , wo_n't necessarily impress hong_kong 's 5.7 million people . many are refugees , having fled china_'s unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the communist_party took power in 1949 . as a result , many of those now planning to leave hong_kong ca_n't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony 's political and economic climate . emigration applications soared in 1985 , when britain and china ratified their accord on hong_kong 's future . in 1987 , hong_kong 's most prosperous year for a decade , 30,000 left , up 58 % from the previous_year . last_year , 45,000 went . the government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next_few years at as_much as 60,000 -- a projection that is widely regarded_as unrealistically low . a large_number of those leaving are managers and professionals . while no_one professes to know the exact cost of such a `` brain drain '' to the economy , hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat . `` when the economy loses a big portion_of its work_force that also happens to include its most productive members , economic_growth is bound to be affected , ''_says anthong wong , an_economist with hang_seng bank .
