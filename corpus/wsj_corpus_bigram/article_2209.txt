bethlehem_steel corp. , hammered by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and service-center customers , posted a 54_% drop in third-quarter_profit . separately , two more of the nation_'s top steelmakers -- armco inc. and national_intergroup inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses , marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry . wall_street analysts_expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth_quarter and through at_least the first two quarters of 1990 , when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product_lines , such_as rolled sheet used for cars , appliances and construction . `` it_does n't bode well for coming quarters , '' said john jacobson , who_follows the steel industry for aus consultants . in fact , he_thinks 0 several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third_quarter of 1990 . bethlehem , the nation_'s second_largest steelmaker , earned_$ 46.9 million , or 54 cents_a share . the figures include $ 15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $ 8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company 's coal operations . in the year-ago_period , bethlehem earned_$ 101.4 million , or $ 1.27 a_share , including a $_3.8 million gain from early_retirement of debt . third-quarter sales dropped 11_% to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year_ago . in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange , bethlehem shares rose 50_cents to $ 17.375 . of all the major_steelmakers , bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown . it has n't diversified beyond steel , nor has it linked up with a joint_venture partner to share costs and risks . however , in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume , bethlehem `` had pretty_good earnings numbers , '' said_0 michelle galanter applebaum , an_analyst with salomon_brothers inc . ms. applebaum had estimated third-quarter_earnings of 55 cents_a share , but said_0 the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected . still , bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating_profit to $ 58.6 million from $ 186.4 million a year_ago , when the industry enjoyed strong_demand and pricing . the company said_0 its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers , a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market . at the same_time , production costs , compared_with a year_ago , were boosted_by higher raw_material and employment costs , which resulted_from the company 's new labor pact effective june 1 . ``_we anticipate that steel market_conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth_quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories , '' said bethlehem chairman walter f. williams . he_noted , however , that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer , following the end of labor negotiations . armco , hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business , said_0 third-quarter_net income dropped 8_% to $ 33_million , or 35_cents a_share , from $ 36 million , or 39_cents a_share in the year-ago_quarter . sales dropped to $ 441.1 million from $ 820.4 million , because the company no_longer consolidates its eastern steel division , which is now a joint_venture with kawasaki steel corp . along_with reduced volume , analysts said_0 the nation_'s fifth largest_steelmaker was hurt_by holding higher-cost inventory when raw_material costs of such key products as nickel dropped . operating_profit dropped 46_% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment . moreover , the company said_0 higher sales and shipments to service centers from its armco steel co. joint_venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market , higher production costs and a poorer product mix . armco shares_closed unchanged_at $ 10.625 in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . national_intergroup , which_owns 50_% of the nation_'s sixth largest_steelmaker -- national steel corp. -- posted_net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ 8.6 million , or 33_cents a_share , compared_with a net_loss of $ 50.3 million . sales_increased in the quarter_ended sept._30 to $ 747.8 million from $ 623.5 million a year_ago . the latest_period includes gains of $ 9.1 million from early_retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward . last_year 's results_were hurt_by $ 41.3 million in restructuring charges . national_intergroup stock closed_at $ 15 , unchanged in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . the company noted_that its fox-meyer drug co. , ben franklin stores_inc. and permian corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves . however , its equity in the net_income of national steel declined to $ 6.3 million from $ 10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike . national_intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50_% interest in national steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations .
