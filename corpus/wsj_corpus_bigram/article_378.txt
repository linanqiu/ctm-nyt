the neighborhood around alexander haagen co. 's vermont-slauson shopping center in the watts section of los_angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area 0 one would choose to visit . but turn_into the shopping center 's parking_lot , and one could_be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb . only it is safer , and busier . over the past year there have_been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 . a shopping center of similar size in an affluent los_angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . the watts mall has annual_sales of more_than $_350 per leasable square_foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would_be $_200 . three other haagen shopping_centers in the watts area are doing almost as_well . a successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken_over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer_base , development capital , and insurability . major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher_prices . along_with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents . thus there_is even more to the vermont-slauson center than a good place to shop . this defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . the center improves the community image to outsiders as_well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . an_additional benefit is the creation of jobs . this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers . it continues through the life of the center ; the vermont-slauson center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job . as many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few_years . and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real_estate , licenses and the like . profits are also plowed back_into the community ; the non-profit vermont-slauson economic_development corp. receives 60_% of the profits from the vermont-slauson center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds_of units -- as_well as commercial and industrial development projects . bradford crowe , director of the mayor 's city economic_development office , says : `` there_is no question that vermont-slauson had a halo effect_on the surrounding neighborhood . what had_been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that vermont-slauson yields . '' another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women . in the grand boulevard plaza developed_by matanky realty group in chicago 's third ward , opposite the robert taylor homes , 29 % of the stores to date have_been leased to blacks and 14_% to members of other minority groups . children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins . so what 's the catch ? primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess . security costs are also quite high . one of these centers can involve years of negotiating_with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing . suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them . security at a typical haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive . the entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number_of remote-controlled gates . shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance . infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit tv cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five_times the industry standard . the security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its_own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center . local law_enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center . these features are also used in matanky realty group 's grand boulevard plaza . haagen has its_own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center . security is 60_% to 70_% of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15_% . these security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban_development action grants , economic_development administration grants , community_development block grants , tax-free industrial development bonds , enterprise zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing . many of these programs no_longer exist , or have_been severely cut_back . however , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there_is nothing to prevent state and local_governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions . many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities . these programs could_be expanded to focus_on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping_centers , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment . new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . if the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond . government_officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit vermont-slauson and grand boulevard plaza and decide for themselves . the answer will_be obvious . mr. titus is a researcher at the justice_department 's national_institute of justice .
