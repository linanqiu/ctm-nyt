it was the kind_of snubbing rarely seen within the congress , let alone within the same party . sen. alan_cranston trekked over to the house side of capitol_hill a few_days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow democrat rep. henry gonzalez . it was offered as an expression of cooperation to mr._gonzalez , who is investigating the $_2.5 billion failure of lincoln_savings &_loan association . but instead of thanks , sen._cranston was treated with cool formality . `` every witness receives a formal subpoena , '' rep. gonzalez told_him . seldom have house hearings caused so_much apprehension in the senate , where california sen._cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , charles keating jr. , principal stockholder of lincoln 's parent_company , american_continental corp. of phoenix , ariz . at the first day of the house_banking committee 's hearings last_week , william seidman , chairman of the resolution_trust corp. , the federal_agency created to sell sick_thrifts , said_0 the agency is investigating whether lincoln made illegal political_contributions . mr._keating arranged nearly $_1 million in donations to sen._cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds_of thousands more to other lawmakers . future witnesses include a former federal s&l regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting_to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on_behalf of mr._keating . unlike many lawmakers , chairman gonzalez says_0 he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . `` when_you reach a point_where a policy-making body is trying_to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the texas lawmaker says . and he has attached himself to the lincoln story tenaciously . `` unless the questions are answered , i will keep on going . '' lawmakers often are_reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties . in the recent housing and urban_development department scandal , for_example , rep. thomas lantos , the california_democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about hud grants secured by sen. alfonse d'amato , a new_york republican . but chairman gonzalez is a genuine maverick . he comes from the same political line as wright patman , a bank-baiting texas populist who chaired the banking_committee until 1974 . mr._gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open . early in his political career , as a city councilman in san_antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` bat-roost meeting . '' the immediate target of rep. gonzalez 's inquiry is danny wall , chairman of the office of thrift_supervision . as the principal regulator of the thrift industry , mr. wall delayed seizing lincoln s&l for more_than two_years after his staff told_him that the california thrift was insolvent and that potential_losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly . rep. gonzalez seems primed to lash out at mr. wall when hearings resume thursday with testimony by two federal_regulators from san_francisco , william black and mike patriarca . mr. wall relieved them of responsibility_for supervising lincoln in 1988 . mr._gonzalez expressed_concern over a report that the two had_been summoned to washington by mr. wall last_week to_discuss their testimony in advance . ``_i think_0 he is trying_to improperly influence a witness , and by god i_'m not_going to tolerate it , '' he_says . mr. wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the senate '' and former staff director of its banking_committee . an inquiry into his handling of lincoln s&l inevitably will drag in sen._cranston and the four others , sens. dennis deconcini -lrb-_d. , ariz. -rrb- , john mccain -lrb-_r. , ariz. -rrb- , john glenn -lrb-_d. , ohio -rrb- and donald riegle -lrb-_d. , mich . -rrb- . they all attended a meeting in april_1987 questioning why a federal audit of lincoln s&l had dragged on for two_years . ``_i 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names -lcb- of the senators -rcb- will_be brought out , '' mr._gonzalez says . this is raising eyebrows . `` when i first got a glimpse at the witness list , i could_n't believe_that they_were going_to go_ahead and do this , ''_says michael waldman , director of congress watch , a consumer group . `` there_are some witnesses who will_be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' and a democratic aide to a banking_committee member remarks , ``_i too am astounded by it , because gonzalez has certainly placed a_lot of democratic_senators in a very bad position . '' all the senators say_0 they merely were trying_to ensure fairness for a constituent . mr._keating lives in phoenix , and the california thrift 's parent is an ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in michigan . chairman gonzalez expresses sympathy for sen. riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the senate_banking committee . `` he 's wise , he 's good and i_know 0 he 's an honest man , '' the texan says . but at the same_time , mr._gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over mr. wall during house-senate negotiations over s&l_bailout legislation during the summer . the senate negotiators included sens. cranston and riegle and mr. wall 's principal sponsor , republican sen. jake garn of utah . they_were willing_to trade important provisions in the bailout_legislation to preserve mr. wall 's job and to_avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would_be called upon to testify about lincoln s&l . most importantly , the senate traded away the bush_administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout , which was partly reinstated later . at the time , mr._gonzalez said_0 several senators told_him that they `` could_get some roadblocks out of the way if there could_be some understanding on garn 's insistence on_wall . '' now mr._gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway , under the guise of the lincoln investigation . `` in a way , that 's what this is , '' mr._gonzalez concedes . even some house_banking committee_members could suffer_from the fallout . mr._keating raised $_20,000 for rep. doug barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the georgia democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering . he recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena 0 to compel mr._keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . but the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal_regulators press a $_1.1 billion fraud suit_against mr._keating and others . rep. jim leach -lrb-_r. , iowa -rrb- says_0 the lincoln s&l affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds_: `` the great question that remains to be_resolved is whether we have a congressional watergate in the making . '' a witness set to testify on thursday was_quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying_0 lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally . but the witness , william crawford , california 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that . ``_i do_n't know whether it was done properly or not , because i_'m not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone_interview yesterday . but he said_0 he is prepared to testify that executives of lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions . the committee also has summoned mr. wall 's predecessor , edwin gray . he has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an_attempt to subvert the ... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even_though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting . so the senators must brace themselves . sen._cranston , as he returned to the capital last_week from a one-day trip 0 to inspect earthquake_damage in san_francisco , sighed to an_aide : `` well , back to keatingland .
