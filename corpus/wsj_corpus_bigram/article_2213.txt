comments by federal_reserve board chairman_alan greenspan lent some support to the dollar , but the u.s. unit ended yesterday lower against most major_currencies . foreign-exchange dealers noted_that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned_that the currency remains sensitive to developments on_wall street . traders_said that mr._greenspan , whose statements are ordinarily cautious , was especially careful to_avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears_about equities still unnerving financial_markets . testifying before a panel of the house_banking committee , mr._greenspan said_0 the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central_bank . `` our essential focus is on domestic policy , '' mr._greenspan said , referring_to the goals of price stability and a stable economy . in perhaps his most telling remark , mr._greenspan termed the current u.s. inflation_rate of around 4.5_% as `` much too_high 0 to be ignored . '' he_added , however , that inflation could_be brought down `` close to zero '' without throwing the economy into a recession . analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an_indication that the central_bank is disinclined to ease monetary_policy further in the near_future . the dollar climbed immediately higher on news of mr._greenspan 's testimony , settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third-quarter u.s. gross_national product . in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8353 marks , down from 1.8355 marks tuesday , and at 141.52 yen , up from 141.45_yen late_tuesday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.6145 , up from $ 1.6055 late_tuesday . in tokyo_thursday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen , up from wednesday 's tokyo_close of 141.55 yen . many traders forecast a continuation of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict 0 the u.s._currency will_remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near_term and then shift lower . but according_to doug madison , a corporate trader with bank of america in los_angeles , a large_number of short_positions must first be corrected , spurring a temporary upswing , before the unit can turn lower . he predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen , noting_that there continues to be a large pool of japanese investor_interest in u.s. securities , which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140_yen . market_participants hope 0 today 's gnp report will offer more substantial evidence on u.s. economic_growth , although analysts are quick to point_out that the figures may overstate the economy 's vigor . `` the ` r ' word is looming again , ''_says one dealer , referring_to persistent concern among some market analysts that the u.s._economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession . some dealers note that while the third-quarter figures may appear relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls_for a 2.5_% annual growth_rate , unchanged from the second-quarter rate -- it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening . some_analysts reckon that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the u.s._economy , showing a marked slowdown in a number_of sectors , including housing_starts and equities . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery settled_at $ 369.10 an_ounce , down $_1.10 . estimated_volume was a light 1.7_million ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong thursday , gold was_quoted at $ 368.24 an_ounce .
