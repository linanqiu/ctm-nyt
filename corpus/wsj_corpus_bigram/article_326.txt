are consumers too deep in hock ? a_lot of observers think so , and , if_they 're right , the whole economy as_well as the spendthrifts among us could_be hurt . a sudden , forced cutback by consumers , who normally account for about two-thirds of economic_activity , would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments ca_n't readily take up the slack . and another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions . the worriers cite some worrisome trends . during the almost seven-year-old economic_expansion , inflation-adjusted gross_national product , disposable personal_income and personal consumption expenditures have_risen 30_% , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 % . and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal_income -- personal_income after taxes -- has hit a high of about 18 1\/2_% . however , these figures do_n't seem to worry thomas_a. durkin , an_economist at the federal_reserve board . in a paper presented at the recent annual_meeting of the national_association of business economists in san_francisco , mr. durkin comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences . '' he_adds : ``_we are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . '' but what about the debt burden ? mr. durkin doubts that `` there_is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . '' and , `` more importantly , '' he_says , `` the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters . '' the chart below shows why -lrb- see_accompanying illustration --_wsj oct._23 , 1989 -rrb- . the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a_bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little_changed . moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may_be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' mr. durkin says_0 . he notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather_than a handy way of borrowing . in_addition , he_says 0 , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster_than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . '' and if_you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' mr. durkin says_0 , `` much of the increase in debt in recent_years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able_to handle it . '' citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11_% of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16_% of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23_% of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . '' and much home-equity credit is used conservatively . `` the most frequent use is home_improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' mr. durkin says . so , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows 0 , reassuringly below some earlier highs -lrb- see_accompanying illustration --_wsj oct._23 , 1989 -rrb- . a severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so_far the current_levels of consumer debt do_n't seem to loom as a major threat . in fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest_that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a_bit more tightly . in july , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first_time since_january 1987 . `` consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending , '' bruce steinberg , a merrill_lynch economist , says . `` as a result , household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63 % of gnp . '' consumers , credit_cards in hand , are n't running amok through the shopping malls -- or putting the economy at any great risk .
