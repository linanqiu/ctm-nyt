after two_years of drought , it rained money in the stock-index_futures markets yesterday . as financial_markets rebounded , trading_volume in the chicago_mercantile exchange 's huge standard_& poor_'s 500_stock-index futures_pit soared , reaching near-record levels for the first_time since october_1987 . the sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders_said . `` guys were minting money in there today , '' said john legittino , a futures broker for elders futures inc. in chicago . the s&p_500 futures_contract , which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an_initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . each_index point represents a $_500 profit for each s&p_500 contract held . for the first_time since the 1987_crash , traders_said that they_were able_to trade several_hundred s&p_500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market . many institutions and individual_investors have shied away_from stock-index_futures , blaming them for speeding the stock_market crash on black_monday two_years ago . since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the s&p_500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them . more_than 400 traders jammed the s&p_500 futures_pit to await the opening_bell . traders were shouting bids and offers a full five_minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am the contract fell five points at the open to 323.85 , the maximum opening move allowed under safeguards adopted by the merc to stem a market slide . but several traders quickly stepped_up and bid for contracts , driving prices sharply_higher . the market hovered near friday_'s closing_price of 328.85 for about a half_hour , moving several index points_higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did_n't look back . the s&p_500 contract that expires in december closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts . `` traders five feet from each_other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart , '' said one s&p_500 broker . `` you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he marveled . several of wall_street 's_largest securities_firms , including salomon_brothers inc. and painewebber_inc. , were also large buyers , traders_said 0 . salomon_brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index_futures last_week , traders_said 0 . brokerage_firms as a rule do_n't comment_on their market_activity . unlike the week following black_monday two_years ago , individual traders in the s&p_500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one-day profits . `` with the fbi around here , bragging rights are a thing of the past , '' said one_trader , referring_to the federal investigation of futures_trading that so_far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the merc and the chicago_board of trade .
