margaret_thatcher 's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as_usual . that may_be the last thing 0 she needs . as the air clears from last_week 's storm of resignations and reshufflings , the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies . the prime_minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested john major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again . mrs._thatcher has to come to terms with european economic integration , beginning with the european_monetary system , which britain is committed to joining fully someday . finally , the government has to convince a rattled financial_community -- and voters -- 0 it is proceeding coherently toward its goals . it sounds_like the work of a decade , but the deadline is late_1991 , when mrs._thatcher is_expected to call another national election . what 's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may_be out of kilter with the political timetable . she could end_up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation , high_interest rates and a heavy trade_deficit . though mrs._thatcher has pulled through other crises , supporters wonder if her steely , autocratic ways are the right formula today . `` there 's a rising fear that perhaps mrs._thatcher 's style of management has_become a political liability , ''_says bill martin , senior economist_at london brokers ubs-phillips &_drew . the prime_minister 's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers --_including an economic guru who openly criticized former chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson -- confused the financial_community . last_week , the strategy of playing the two experts off each_other blew up : mr._lawson quit in exasperation and sir_alan walters , the adviser , announced his_resignation within an_hour . the confusion could_be costly . currency traders , suspecting 0 mr. major wo_n't defend the pound strenuously , sent the british currency sharply_lower friday against the dollar and west_german mark . analysts_expect further jitters this_week . a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base_rate , currently 15_% . that could shove a weak economy into recession . economists have_been anticipating a slump for months , but they now say_0 it will_be deeper and longer than they had thought . britain_'s economy `` is developing rapidly toward no-growth , ''_says 0 j. paul horne , international economist with smith_barney , harris_upham co. in paris . a mild slowdown probably would_have run its course by early 1991 , economists say_0 , while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992 . recovery could_be hampered if britain_'s major trading partners in europe , which are enjoying robust economic_activity , cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991 . that would_leave mrs._thatcher little room for maneuver . for the tories to win the next election , voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand . though mrs._thatcher does_n't need to call an election until june 1992 , she would_prefer doing so in late_1991 . `` if the economy shows no_sign of turning_around in about year 's time , she will_be very vulnerable , ''_says john barnes , a lecturer at the london school of economics . there 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european_community . it has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the european_monetary system , which links the major ec currencies . at a june ec summit , mrs._thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full ems membership , saying_0 britain would join once its inflation_rate fell and the ec liberalized capital movements . since_then , the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join . sir_alan assailed the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in an article being published in an american economics journal . that produced little reaction from his boss , reinforcing speculation 0 the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full ems membership . despite the departure of mr._lawson and sir_alan , the tug-of-war over the ems could continue . sir geoffrey howe , deputy prime_minister and a lawson ally on the ems , has signaled 0 he will_continue pressing for early membership . of immediate concern is whether the thatcher government will_continue mr._lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west_german bundesbank and responding in kind when the frankfurt authorities move interest_rates . mrs._thatcher `` does_n't like taking orders from foreigners , ''_says 0 tim congdon , economist with gerrard & national holding plc . as conservatives rally around mrs._thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes 0 last_week 's debacle will prompt change . ``_we wo_n't have any more of this wayward behavior , ''_says sir peter hordern , a backbench tory member of parliament . `` the party is fed up with sackings of good people . '' it 's an unrealistic expectation . as long as a decade_ago , mrs._thatcher declared 0 she_did n't_want debate in her cabinet ; she wanted strong government . over the weekend , she said_0 she_did n't intend_to change her style and denied 0 she is authoritarian . `` nonsense , '' she told an interviewer yesterday on london weekend television . ``_i am staying my_own sweet , reasonable self .
