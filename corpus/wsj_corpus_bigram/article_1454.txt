when china opened its doors to foreign_investors in 1979 , toy_makers from hong_kong were among the first 0 to march in . today , with about 75_% of the companies_' products being made in china , the chairman of the hong_kong toys council , dennis ting , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` made in china by hong_kong companies . '' the toy_makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british_colony . but in the wake_of the shootings in beijing on june_4 , the hong_kong toy industry is worrying_about its strong dependence on china . although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected_by china_'s political turmoil , they_are looking_for additional sites . the toy_makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty_about china_'s economic and political policies . `` nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , ''_says david yeh , chairman and chief_executive officer of international matchbox group ltd . indeed , matchbox and other leading hong_kong toy_makers were setting_up factories in southeast_asia , especially in thailand , long before the massacre . their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china . by diversifying supply sources , the toy_makers do_n't intend_to withdraw_from china , manufacturers and foreign buyers say_0 . it would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern china during the past_decade . a supply of cheap labor and the access to hong_kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such_as printing companies , have made china_'s guangdong province a premier manufacturing site . `` south china is the most competitive source of toys in the world , ''_says henry hu , executive_director of wah shing toys consolidated ltd . hong_kong trade_figures illustrate the toy_makers ' reliance_on factories across the border . in 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19_% from 1987 , to hk$ 10.05 billion -lrb-_us$ 1.29_billion -rrb- . but re-exports , mainly from china , jumped 75_% , to hk$ 15.92 billion . in 1989 's first seven_months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to hk$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56_% , to hk$ 11.28 billion . manufacturers say_0 there_is no_immediate substitute for southern china , where an_estimated 120,000 people are employed_by the toy industry . `` for the next_few years , like it or not , china is going_to be the main supplier , ''_says edmund young , vice_president of perfecta enterprises ltd. , one of the first big hong_kong toy_makers 0 to move across the border . in the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they_are focusing mainly on southeast_asia . several big companies have established manufacturing joint_ventures in thailand , including matchbox , wah shing and kader industrial co. , the toy manufacturer headed_by mr. ting . malaysia , the philippines and indonesia also are_being studied . with the european_community set to remove its internal trade_barriers in 1992 , several hong_kong companies are beginning to consider spain , portugal and greece as possible manufacturing sites . worries_about china came just as hong_kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major u.s. companies , worlds of wonder inc. and coleco industries_inc . hong_kong manufacturers say_0 large debt writeoffs and other financial_problems resulting_from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management . the industry regards last_year and this_year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail_sales in the u.s. , hong_kong 's_biggest market for toys and games . the closest thing 0 the colony 's companies have to a u.s. mega-hit this_year is the teenage mutant ninja turtles series of action figures manufactured by playmates holdings ltd . introduced in mid-1988 , the 15-centimeter-tall plastic turtles are based_on an american comic book and television series . paul kwan , managing_director of playmates , says_0 10 million ninja turtles have_been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the u.s. . should sales continue to be strong through the christmas_season , which accounts for about 60_% of u.s. retail toy sales , mr. kwan said_0 the ninja turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for playmates . other hong_kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only_slightly this_year from 1988 . besides the lack_of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the u.s. market by nintendo entertainment system , an expensive video game made by nintendo co. of japan . nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products . many of the toy_makers ' problems started well before june_4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and beijing 's austerity programs launched late_last year . toy_makers complain that electricity in guangdong has_been provided only three_days a week in recent_months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity . manufacturers are upgrading standby power_plants . bank credit for china investments all but dried up following june_4 . also , concern exists that the harder-line beijing leadership will tighten its control of guangdong , which has_been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic_reforms . but , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say_0 beijing will_be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern china . they say_0 china_'s trade_deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign_exchange for it to hamper production in guangdong . `` the chinese_leaders have to decide_whether they_want control or whether the want exports , ''_says mr. kwan of playmates .
