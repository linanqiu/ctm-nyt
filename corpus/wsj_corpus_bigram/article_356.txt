this letter was inspired by david asman 's sept._25 editorial-page_article about fidel castro , `` man in the middle of drug trafficking . '' i_'ve organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists . in any matters between us and the cubans there can_be no simplicity , consequently i_'ve become familiar not_only with cuban art and artists , but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our_own government . despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my_mind , valuable and well worth the effort . there_is a simple reason for this : the cuban people . let_me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . those `` people '' to whom i refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they_are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the ministry of culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the cuban revolution , spelled out in terms such_as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc . in fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right_now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes che guevara 's famous linkages of art , idealism and revolution seem modest . it is on_behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that i_am responding to mr. asman 's opinions of their country . the ochoa trial in july , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of cuba . however , unacceptable though those occurrences may_have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth . mr. asman should make distinctions among fidel , the army and the cuban people . they_are not interchangeable , since they_are motivated to act based_on their_own circumstances . it is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -lrb- as we well know -rrb- , and it is even_worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy . mr. asman is also annoyed that mr. castro has resisted collaboration with u.s. officials , even_though by his_own account that collaboration has_been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime , such_as facilitating defections . i_think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that fidel does_n't invite the u.s. state_department to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its_own territory . we badly need to follow fact rather_than the rhetoric of conventional_wisdom . without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on cuba will_continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30_years . from my_own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things 0 we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these_days . there_is no rational justification for such behavior . rachel weiss brookline , mass .
