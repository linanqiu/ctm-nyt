i was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your_oct. 13 editorial `` colombia 's brave publisher . '' it is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers , not the left wing . this information was gleaned from your_own news stories on the region . past colombian government tolerance of the `` narcotraficantes '' was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands . mary poulin palo_alto , calif. i suggest_that the wall_street journal -lrb- as_well as other u.s. news publications of like mind -rrb- should put its money where its mouth is : lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at el_espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of el_espectador journalists . perhaps an arrangement could_be worked_out to `` sponsor '' el_espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories . reward el_espectador 's courage with real support . douglas b. evans
