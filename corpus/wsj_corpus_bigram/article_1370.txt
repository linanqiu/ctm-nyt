the senate 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction_bill without a capital-gains_tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this_year . late_friday night , the senate voted 87-7 to approve an_estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had_been stripped of hundreds_of provisions that would_have widened , rather_than narrowed , the federal_budget deficit . lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax_breaks and spending increases . ``_we 're putting a deficit-reduction_bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction_bill , '' said senate budget_committee chairman james sasser -lrb-_d. , tenn . -rrb- . but senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had_been cast aside , including a capital-gains_tax cut . in_addition , the companion deficit-reduction_bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains_provision . house-senate negotiations are_likely to begin at midweek and last for a while . `` no_one can predict exactly_what will happen on the house side , '' said senate minority leader robert_dole -lrb-_r. , kan . -rrb- . but , he_added 0 , ``_i believe_0 republicans and democrats will work_together to get capital-gains reform this_year . '' white_house budget_director richard_darman told_reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to_keep the capital-gains_cut in the final version of the bill . ``_we do_n't need this as a way_0 to get capital_gains , '' he said . house_budget committee_chairman leon panetta -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- said in an_interview , 0 `` if that 's the signal that comes from the white_house , that will_help a great_deal . '' the senate 's decision was a setback for president_bush and will make approval of a capital-gains_tax cut less certain this_year . opponents of the cut are playing hardball . senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- said_0 he was `` confident '' that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction_legislation would n't include a capital-gains_tax cut . and a senior aide to the house_ways and means_committee , where tax legislation originates , said_0 there_are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax_cut this_year . '' one obvious place 0 to attach a capital-gains_tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction_bill , is the legislation 0 to raise the federal borrowing limit . such legislation must_be enacted by the end of the month . the senate_bill was pared back in an_attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress . because the legislation has n't been completed , president_bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending_cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law . senators hope that the need to_avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the streamlined bill . the house appears reluctant_to join the senators . a key is whether house republicans are willing_to acquiesce to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions . `` although i_am encouraged_by the senate action , '' said chairman dan rostenkowski -lrb-_d. , ill . -rrb- of the house_ways and means_committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can_be achieved in the upcoming conference with the senate . '' another big question hovering over the debate is what president_bush thinks . he has_been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote_on his capital-gains_tax cut . but republican senators saw no_way 0 to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill . the senate_bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number_of which are included in the house-passed bill . these_include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax_breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures . also missing from the senate_bill is the house 's repeal of a law , called section_89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health_benefits to top paid executives . one high-profile provision that was originally in the senate_bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd_bentsen -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- of the senate_finance committee to_expand the deduction for individual_retirement accounts . mr. bentsen said_0 he hopes 0 the senate will consider that measure soon . to the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance_committee that would_have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under medicare . to the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . asked why senators were giving_up so_much , new_mexico sen. pete domenici , the ranking republican on the senate budget_committee , said , 0 ``_we 're_looking like idiots . things had just gone too_far . '' sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . it worked , others said_0 , because there_were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . the senate also dropped a plan by its finance_committee that would_have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their social_security benefits reduced . in_addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3_% excise tax on long-distance telephone_calls . it no_longer includes a plan that would_have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . it also drops a provision that would_have permitted corporations to use excess pension_funds to pay health_benefits for current retirees . also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum occupational safety and health administration penalties , which would_have raised $ 65 million in fiscal_1990 . a provision that would_have made the social_security administration an_independent agency was excised . the approval of the senate_bill was especially sweet for sen._mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining . mr. mitchell 's relations with budget_director darman , who pushed for a capital-gains_cut to be added to the measure , have_been strained since mr. darman chose to bypass the maine democrat and deal_with other lawmakers earlier_this year during a dispute_over drug funding in the fiscal_1989 supplemental spending_bill . the deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal_1990 , and $ 26 billion over five_years . the revenue-raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would : -- prevent companies that have made leveraged_buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting_from losses caused_by interest_payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective aug. 2 , 1989 . -- require mutual_funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather_than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted . -- close a loophole regarding employee_stock ownership plans , effective june 6 , 1989 , that has_been exploited by investment_bankers in corporate takeovers . the measure repeals a 50_% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to_acquire securities for an esop , if the esop owns less_than 30_% of the employer 's stock . -- curb junk_bonds by ending tax_benefits for certain securities , such_as zero-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest_payments . -- raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes . -- speed_up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective august 1990 . -- impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals , such_as those used in air conditioners and in styrofoam , beginning at $_1.10 a pound starting next_year . -- withhold income_taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt_from withholding . -- change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly , effective next_year . -- restrict the ability of real_estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . -- increase to $_6 a person from $_3 the international air-passenger departure tax , and impose a $ 3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships . the measure also_includes spending_cuts and increases in federal fees . among its provisions : -- reduction of medicare spending in fiscal_1990 by some $_2.8 billion , in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians . the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next_year . -- removal of the u.s. postal_service 's operating budget from the federal_budget , reducing the deficit by $ 1.77 billion . a similar provision is in the house_version . -- authority for the federal_aviation administration to raise $ 239 million by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at new_york 's laguardia and john_f. kennedy international airports , o'hare international airport in chicago and national airport in washington . -- increases in nuclear regulatory_commission fees totaling_$ 54_million . -- direction to the u.s. coast_guard to collect $ 50_million from users of coast_guard services . -- raising an_additional $ 43 million by increasing existing federal communications commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators , ship stations and mobile radio facilities . john e. yang contributed_to this_article .
