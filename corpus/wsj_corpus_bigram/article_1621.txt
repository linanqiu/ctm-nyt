courtaulds plc announced_plans to spin_off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder_value . the british chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder_approval , would_create a new , listed u.k. stock with a probable market_capitalization between # 300_million -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- and # 400_million , analysts said_0 . the establishment of the separate company , 0 to be called courtaulds textiles , could_be effective as early as next_year 's first_quarter . investors welcomed the move . courtaulds ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion . courtaulds ' spinoff reflects pressure_on british industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders . courtaulds ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in britain , though it is dwarfed by b.a.t_industries plc 's plans to spin_off roughly # 4_billion in assets to help fend_off a takeover_bid from anglo-french financier sir_james goldsmith . the divested courtaulds textile operations had operating_profit of # 50_million on # 980 million in revenue in the year_ended march_31 . some_analysts have said_0 courtaulds ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5_% to 10_% , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they_did combined . in_addition , courtaulds said_0 the moves are logical because_they will_allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities . courtaulds has_been under_pressure to enhance shareholder_value since takeover speculators --_including australian financier kerry packer -- surfaced holding small stakes last_year . though mr. packer has since sold his stake , courtaulds is moving to_keep its institutional shareholders happy . even without a specific takeover_threat , courtaulds is giving shareholders `` choice and value , '' said_0 julia blake , an_analyst at london stockbrokers barclays_de zoete_wedd . in a statement , the company said : `` both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if_they are separately quoted companies . the sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . '' courtaulds chairman and chief_executive sir christopher hogg will_remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .
