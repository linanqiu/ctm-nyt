wall_street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks . for three_years , a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels . as the good times rolled they more_than doubled their prices for pulp , a raw_material used in all_sorts of paper , to $ 830 a metric_ton this past spring from $ 380 a ton at the start of 1986 . but now the companies are getting_into trouble because_they undertook a record expansion program while they_were raising prices sharply . third-quarter profits fell at several companies . `` put your money in a good utility or bank stock , not a paper company , '' advises george adler of smith_barney . other analysts are nearly as pessimistic . gary palmero of oppenheimer_& co. expects a 30_% decline in earnings between now and 1991 for `` commodity-oriented '' paper companies , which account for the majority of the industry . robert schneider of duff_& phelps sees paper-company stock_prices falling 10_% to 15_% in 1990 , perhaps 25_% if there 's a recession . paper companies concede_that business has_been off recently . but they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions . generally they maintain that , barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign_currencies , the industry is n't headed for a prolonged slump . `` it wo_n't be an earthshaking drop , '' a weyerhaeuser spokesman says . last_week mr. adler lowered his rating from hold to `` avoid '' on boise cascade , champion_international , great_northern nekoosa , international_paper , louisiana pacific and weyerhaeuser . oppenheimer 's mr. palmero , meanwhile , is steering clear of gaylord container , stone container and federal paper board . mr. schneider is cool to georgia pacific and abitibi-price . lawrence ross of painewebber would avoid union camp . the companies in question believe_0 the analysts are too pessimistic . great_northern nekoosa said , `` the odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small . '' international_paper emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more_than one grade of paper . a boise-cascade spokesman referred to a speech by chairman_john fery , in which he said that markets generally are stable , although some risk of further price deterioration exists . stone container chairman roger stone said that , unlike for some other paper products , demand_for stone 's principal commodity , unbleached containerboard , remains strong . he_expects the price for that product to rise even more next_year . gaylord container said_0 analysts are_skeptical of it because it 's carrying a_lot of debt . champion_international said , ``_we 've gotten our costs down and we_'re better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we_'ve ever been . '' louisiana pacific and georgia pacific said_0 a number_of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business . federal paper board said , ``_we 're_not as exposed as the popular perception of us . '' the company explained that its main product , bleached paperboard , which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes , historically does_n't have sharp price_swings . because the stock_prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump , painewebber 's mr._ross says_0 he_thinks that next_year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5_% to 10_% . a company such_as federal paper board may_be overly discounted and looks `` tempting '' to him , he_says 0 , though he is n't_yet recommending the shares . wall_street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper . mr. palmero recommends temple-inland , explaining that it is `` virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion , '' and thus should_be able_to lower long-term_debt substantially next_year . a temple-inland spokesman_said 0 the company expects record earnings in 1989 , and ``_we 're still pretty bullish '' on 1990 . the analysts_say 0 their gloomy forecasts have a flip side . some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies , which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices . estimates on how_much pulp prices will fall next_year currently run between $_150 and $_250 a metric_ton . analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers , scott paper and kimberly-clark . a spokesman for scott says that assuming 0 the price of pulp continues to soften , ``_we should do well .
