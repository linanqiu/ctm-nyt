move over , pornographic phone services : a legal service with a `` 900 '' number has_been launched in california . a newport_beach law_firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called telelawyer , using mci communication corp. 's toll-tele-phone service . cane &_associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour 0 you_'ll ever find . '' though the service is available only in california , telelawyer founder michael cane says_0 he plans to franchise it in other_states . he_says 0 his aim is to reach people_who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca_n't find a lawyer 0 to take their case or simply ca_n't afford lawyers_' consultation fees . mr. cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep . ``_we will only deal_with clients on the phone , '' he_says . ``_we have no in-office business . '' telelawyer is apparently the only telephone_service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit . local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law . there also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation . when a caller reaches telelawyer by dialing 900-telelaw , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys . in an_effort to determine_whether a caller has reason 0 to sue , cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if_necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers . there_is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone . if the matter requires further legal work or litigation , mr. cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law_firm . but he_says 0 cane &_associates does_n't receive referral fees . so_far , says mr. cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions . the firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15_minutes . out of the $_2 charge , the law_firm pockets about $_1.55 . jury convicts congressman in_connection with wedtech corp. scandal . a federal_court jury in new_york found u.s. rep. robert garcia -lrb-_d. , n.y . -rrb- and his_wife , jane lee garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman . the jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $_20,000 , interest-free loan from a wedtech officer . the jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from mrs. garcia . wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned south_bronx , n.y. , defense_contractor . edward j.m. little , one of the assistant_u.s. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said_0 the garcia trial `` is the last of the wedtech prosecutions . '' mr. little said_0 more_than 20 people have_been convicted in the wedtech cases , including former u.s. rep. mario biaggi -lrb-_d. , n.y . -rrb- . lawyers for the garcias said_0 they plan to appeal . mr. garcia , who_represents new_york 's 18th congressional district , which_includes the bronx , said_0 he has n't decided whether he will resign . `` in the next_few weeks , i will_be consulting with my political advisers and with the democratic_leaders about the best_way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said_0 mr. garcia , 56 years_old . mrs. garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of mr. garcia 's congressional staff . the garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities . u.s. judge leonard b. sand set the garcias ' sentencing for jan. 5 . five shea_& gould partners are leaving to form a new firm . the new firm , hutton ingram yuzek gainen carroll & bertolotti , will_be based in new_york . the five partners who_resigned from shea_& gould late_last week are tom hutton , sam ingram , dean yuzek , daniel carroll and ernest bertolotti . they will_be joined by larry gainen , who_resigned from the firm of lepatner , gainen & block . howard rubenstein , a new_york publicist who_represents shea_& gould , said , `` shea_& gould understands 0 they_'re leaving because_they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm 0 they would_be principals of . '' mr. rubenstein said_0 the five , who were n't on shea_& gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . '' he said_0 shea_& gould held a number_of discussions_with the five partners during the past_few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their_own firm . hutton ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community . disciplinary proceedings against lawyers open to public in illinois . while investigations into lawyer misconduct will_remain secret , the public will_be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an_attorney . the actual disciplinary hearings will_be public . in_addition , illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them . non-lawyers will_be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct . illinois joins 36 other_states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according_to the american bar_association . one vocal critic of the changes , chicago lawyer warren lupel , says_0 non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because_they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships . in_addition , he_says 0 , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation . nevertheless , mr. lupel anticipates no legal_action to reverse the illinois supreme_court 's decision to institute the changes . `` there 's no constitutional_right involved in the rule change , '' he_says . `` you_do n't have a right to practice . you only have a privilege to practice .
