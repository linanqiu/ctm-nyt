the government said_0 it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , compania nacional de subsistencias populares , or conasupo . conasupo director ignacio ovalle fernandez said_0 the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early_next year . the agency will withdraw_from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most_important ones , corn and milk . mr. ovalle also said_0 conasupo will cut_back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail_outlets in wealthy neighborhoods . the agency 's workers and private companies would_be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale . conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail_outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices . business_leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste . private-sector leaders praised the conasupo restructuring . but most economists doubt 0 the streamlining would cut deeply into conasupo government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer_prices for corn and milk .
