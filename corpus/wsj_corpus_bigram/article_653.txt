ever_since the hotly contested america 's cup race last_year , the famous yachting match has run_into more rough sailing out of the water than in it . now that a key member of the san_diego yacht club team is splitting off to form his_own team , even more competition lies ahead . peter isler , the winning navigator in the past_two america 's cup challenges , has split from the team led_by dennis conner , skipper of the victorious stars & stripes , to form his_own team for the next contest in 1992 . and , in_addition to a crack team of sailors , mr. isler has lined_up some real brass 0 to help him finance the syndicate . isler sailing international 's advisory board includes ted turner , turner_broadcasting chairman and a former cup victor ; peter g. diamandis , head of diamandis communications , and joseph b. vittoria , chairman and chief_executive of avis inc . his steering committee includes other notable businessmen , including the california investor and old salt roy e. disney . ``_we have the structure , people and plan , '' mr. isler said in a statement . now , the first order of business is raising enough money 0 to_keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $_3 million alone , and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $ 25 million for a cup challenge . the split comes in the midst_of a court battle_over whether the san_diego yacht club should_be allowed to_keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the new_zealand challengers ' 90-foot monohull . in_september , a new_york appellate_court overturned a state judge 's ruling that awarded the cup to the new_zealand team . pending an_appeal by the new_zealand team , led_by michael fay , the finals for the next cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in san_diego . but because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit , mr. conner 's team has done little 0 to begin gearing up to defend its title . `` if_you do_n't know_what the rules of the game are , it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design , '' said dana smith , an_official with team dennis conner . the conner team wo_n't be_able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined , mr._smith said_0 , and the syndicate 's budget could_easily reach $ 30 million . but spokesmen for both mr. isler and mr. conner say_0 the formation of the new syndicate has to do with mr. isler 's desire to skipper his_own team and begin planning now , rather_than any falling out between the two sportsmen . mr._smith and a spokesman for the america 's cup organizing committee insist_that the added competition for the defender 's spot will only improve the race .
