price_wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . `` when elephants start fighting , ants get killed , ''_says murray riese , co-owner of national restaurants , a new_york franchisee for pizza_hut , roy rogers and other chains . as hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping_up costly promotions . the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations_between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . the chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last_year or so , discounting has_become a 12-month thing , ''_says 0 donald harty , president of charisma group_inc. , a new_york franchisee of grand_metropolitan plc 's burger_king chain . though charisma 's sales are up slightly this_year , mr. harty says_0 profits will_be flat or lower . and bill konopnicki , a safford , ariz. , licensee of mcdonald_'s corp. who is chairman of the company 's national operators advisory board , says_0 some fast-food outlets `` could_be in serious trouble , based_on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' until_recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last_year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum . but early this_year , pepsico_inc. 's taco bell unit and wendy 's international_inc. slashed prices and stepped_up promotions , says_0 john rohs , an_analyst for wertheim_schroder &_co . that brought a chain reaction in the industry . the situation was further aggravated early this_month , when mcdonald_'s set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons . it also decided to go national with pizza , which it has_been test-marketing . now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice_as high . the discounting , say_0 fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency 0 they have n't seen before . the result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . joe mack , a district manager for cormack enterprises_inc. , a burger_king operator in omaha , neb. , says_0 discounting is so prevalent that ``_we have to serve 15_% to 20_% more customers '' to_keep sales level . `` it 's almost as if_you 're_doing extra work to give away the food , '' he_says . alan d'agosto , president of panda 's inc. , an operator of arby_'s restaurants in omaha , says : `` all 0 we_'re doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' with fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does_n't think_0 he has a choice in the price war : `` our_customers say that they wo_n't go_into a fast-food store unless_they get a coupon . '' if the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts 0 vincent morrissey , who owns a string of kentucky_fried chicken stores in the midwest . `` the industry is overbuilt , '' he_says . `` fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' the national restaurant association says_0 quick-service restaurant units in the u.s. rose 14_% to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last_year for which figures_are available . with the market so crowded , says_0 a spokesman for wendy 's in columbus , ohio , `` if_you 're_doing well , you_'re doing_well at someone_else 's expense . '' simply put , there_is n't enough business for every store to grow . according_to mr. rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned wendy 's units in the u.s. have trailed year-earlier_levels throughout 1989 , except_for august . `` mcdonald_'s has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says . spokesmen for wendy 's and mcdonald_'s criticized mr. rohs 's calculations . jack greenberg , executive_vice president and chief_financial officer of mcdonald_'s , says_0 the company does_n't compute , much_less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales . he_adds that short-term comparisons `` can_be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . '' profit_margins at company-owned mcdonald_'s outlets in the u.s. `` are holding up quite nicely , ''_says mr._greenberg . profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he_adds 0 . but mr._greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry_observers . smaller chains and single-store operators will_be the first 0 to fail , many in the industry predict 0 . big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a_lot longer , ''_says mr. harty , the burger_king operator in new_york . the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . mr. morrissey , the kentucky_fried chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without_any cut in the royalties , or portion_of sales , that they must_pay franchisers . franchisees ca_n't be_forced to go along_with a franchiser 's discounting . but once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says_0 lew rudnick , a principal of rudnick & wolfe , a chicago law_firm with franchise industry clients . he_says 0 courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to_protect consumers from deceptive marketing . in any_case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along_with promotions . says mr. riese of national restaurants : `` if_you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .
