wall_street 's big securities_firms face the prospect of having their credit_ratings lowered . the reason_: risks from the firms ' new `` merchant_banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes . the downgrading of debt issued by cs_first boston inc. , parent of first_boston corp. , by_moody 's investors_service inc. , coupled_with a moody_'s announcement that shearson_lehman hutton holdings_inc. is under_review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this_week . with the shudders came the realization that some of wall_street 's_biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably . securities_firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial_paper , or short-term corporate ious , which they sell to finance their daily operations . the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial_paper . but moody_'s warned_that shearson 's commercial_paper rating could_be lowered soon , a move that would reduce shearson 's profit_margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms . shearson is 62%-owned by american_express co . `` just as the 1980s bull_market transformed the u.s. securities business , so too will the more_difficult environment of the 1990s , ''_says christopher t. mahoney , a moody_'s vice_president . `` a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . '' standard_& poor_'s corp. says_0 first_boston , shearson and drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , in particular , are_likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months_ahead . what worries credit-rating concerns the most is that wall_street firms are taking long-term risks with their_own capital via leveraged_buy-out and junk_bond financings . that 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost_all financing risks to investors . whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be_sold quickly , wall_street 's new penchant for leveraged_buy-outs and junk_bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years . `` the recent disarray in the junk_bond market suggests_that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says_0 jeffrey bowman , a vice_president at s&p , which raised a warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs_first boston . `` wall_street is facing a catch-22 situation , ''_says mr. mahoney of moody_'s . merchant_banking , where firms commit their_own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it 0 to go around . '' in_addition , he_says , the buy-out business is under_pressure `` because of the junk_bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are_likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks . in a leveraged_buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will_be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets . in a recent report , moody_'s said_0 it `` expects intense_competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined_with overcapacity , will create poor prospects_for profitability . '' it said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an_additional rating factor . '' both moody_'s and s&p cited first_boston 's reliance in recent_years on merchant_banking , which has_been responsible_for a significant portion_of the closely_held firm 's profit . the recent cash_squeeze at campeau_corp. , first_boston 's most_lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to first_boston because it arranged more_than $_3 billion of high-yield , high-risk_junk financings for campeau units . in_addition , a big loan that first_boston made to ohio mattress co . was n't repaid on time when its $_450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn . `` these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion_of cs_first boston 's equity , '' moody_'s said . `` total merchant_banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . '' cs_first boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest_shareholder , credit_suisse , switzerland 's third largest bank . shearson also has_been an aggressive participant in the leveraged_buy-out business . but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no_signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the october_1987 stock_market crash . in_addition , shearson 's listed $_2 billion of capital is overstated , according_to the rating concerns , because it includes $_1.7 billion of goodwill . shearson `` really only has $_300 million of capital , ''_says mr. bowman of s&p . a shearson spokesman_said 0 the firm is n't worried . `` a year_ago , moody_'s also had shearson under_review for possible downgrade , '' he said . `` after two_months of talks , our rating was maintained . '' drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall_street rivals because it has a slightly_lower commercial_paper rating . the collapse of junk_bond prices and the cancellation of many junk_bond financings apparently have_taken their toll on closely_held drexel , the leading underwriter in that market . the firm also has_been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming_from its guilty_plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal . drexel this_year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 . recently , drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities_firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this_year from previous years . the firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say_0 . drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness . ``_we 're well positioned with $_1.7 billion of capital , '' a drexel spokesman_said 0 . `` and as a leading investment and merchant_banking firm , the fact_that we are no_longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view . moreover , we_'ve probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs , which are down around 40_% over the last six_months .
