the white_house called on congress to attach the proposed capital-gains_tax cut to its final deficit-reduction_bill , but lawmakers seem likely_to balk at the idea . earlier_this month , the white_house endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that congress could pass quickly a `` clean '' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal_budget targets under the gramm-rudman act . but now that congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the gramm-rudman targets , the white_house said_0 it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains_cut should_be part_of the deficit-reduction_bill , on which congress continues to work . `` if that does_n't happen , then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote , '' said press_secretary marlin_fitzwater . on_capitol hill , though , there does_n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital_gains and the deficit-reduction_bill . texas rep. william archer , the ranking republican on the house_ways and means_committee said , ``_i do_n't see_how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains_tax cut there . meanwhile , president_bush stepped_up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains_tax cut . the white_house said_0 he plans to hold a series of private white_house meetings , mostly with senate_democrats , to try_to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax_cut . the first meeting yesterday was with 10 senate_democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax . according_to some who_attended , the senators argued_that the president should give the democratic_leaders in congress a victory of their_own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue . issues discussed in this context were an_increase in the minimum_wage and an_increase in child-care spending . the president was said to have_been noncommittal .
