predicting the financial results of computer firms has_been a tough job lately . take microsoft corp. , the largest maker of personal_computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether . in july , the company stunned wall_street with the prediction that growth in the personal_computer business overall would_be only 10_% in 1990 , a modest increase when compared_with the sizzling expansion of years past . investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close_at $ 52 in national_over-the-counter trading . but that was all of three_months ago . last_week , microsoft said_0 it_expects revenue for its first_quarter ended_sept. 30 to increase 34_% . the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 to close_at $ 75.50 a_share . microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking_for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms . `` it 's hard to know_what to expect at this point , '' said peter rogers , an_analyst at robertson stephens &_co . `` the industry defies characterization . '' to illustrate , mr. rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms 0 he follows , half will report for their most_recent quarter earnings below last_year 's results , and half above those results . among those companies expected to have a down quarter are hewlett-packard_co. , amdahl corp. and sun_microsystems inc. , generally solid performers in the past . international_business machines_corp. also is_expected to report disappointing results . apple_computer inc. , meanwhile , is_expected to show improved_earnings for the period_ended sept . another contradictory message comes from businessland inc. , a computer retailer . in july , the company reported that booming sales of new personal_computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net_income more_than doubling for its fourth_quarter ended_june 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23_cents a_share . this_month , however , businessland warned investors that results for its first_quarter ended_sept. 30 had n't met expectations . the company said_0 it_expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents_a share , down from 25_cents a_share in the year-earlier_period . while the earnings picture confuses , observers_say 0 the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer . companies will_continue to war over standards . in computer publishing , a battle_over typefaces is hurting adobe systems_inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced_by printers and displays . until_recently , adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last_month apple , adobe 's_biggest customer , and microsoft rebelled . now the two firms are collaborating on an_alternative to adobe 's approach , and analysts_say 0 they_are likely_to carry ibm , the biggest seller of personal_computers , along_with them . the short-term outlook for adobe 's business , however , appears strong . the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by apple . the program is aimed_at improving the quality of printed material . john warnock , adobe 's chief_executive officer , said_0 the mountain view , calif. , company has_been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several_weeks ago . meanwhile , competition between various operating_systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally . `` it creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , '' said russ crabs , an_analyst at soundview financial group . mr. crabs said_0 this probably is behind the expected weak performance of aldus corp. , maker of a widely_used computer publishing program . he_expects aldus to report earnings of 21 cents_a share on revenues of $ 19.5 million for its third_quarter , compared_with earnings of 30 cents_a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier_period . aldus officials could_n't be_reached for comment . on the other_hand , the battle of the bus is_expected to grow increasingly irrelevant . a bus is the data highway within a computer . ibm is backing one type of bus called microchannel , while the nine other leading computer_makers , including h-p and compaq_computer corp. , have chosen another method . `` users do_n't care about the bus , '' said daniel benton , an_analyst at goldman , sachs_& co . he said_0 apple 's family of macintosh computers , for_instance , uses four different buses `` and no_one seems to mind . '' the gap_between winners and laggards will grow . in personal_computers , apple , compaq and ibm are_expected to tighten their hold on their business . at the same_time , second-tier firms will_continue to lose ground . some lagging competitors even may leave the personal_computer business altogether . wyse technology , for_instance , is considered a candidate 0 to sell its troubled operation . `` wyse has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said kimball brown , an_analyst at_prudential-bache securities . mr. brown estimates 0 wyse , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents_a share for its quarter_ended sept . personal-computer makers will_continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms . ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are_expected to increasingly take on functions carried_out by more_expensive minicomputers and mainframes . `` the guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines , '' said mr. benton . as a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses h-p , ibm and digital_equipment corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their_own . but they will have to act quickly . mr. benton expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal_computers later_this year that are powerful enough to serve_as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines . a raft of new computer companies also has targeted this `` server '' market .
