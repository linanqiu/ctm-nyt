energetic and concrete action has_been taken in colombia during the past 60_days against the mafiosi of the drug trade , but it has not been sufficiently effective , because , unfortunately , it came too_late . ten years_ago , the newspaper el_espectador , of which my brother guillermo was editor , began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics , especially the congress . then , when it would_have been easier to resist them , nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug mafias three_years ago . the most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor colombia 's . the censorship is enforced through terrorism and assassination . in the past 10_years about 50 journalists have_been silenced forever , murdered . within the past_two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the el_espectador in bogota , destroying a major part_of its installations and equipment . and only last_week the newspaper vanguardia liberal in the city of bucaramanga was bombed , and its installations destroyed . journalists and their_families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets . distribution centers are bombed , and advertisers are intimidated . censorship is imposed by terrorism . if the colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there_is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world . the solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way_0 press freedom can survive . the american people and their government also woke up too_late to the menace 0 drugs posed to the moral structure of their country . even now , the american attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat . i can attest that a recent colombian visitor to the u.s. was offered drugs three_times in the few blocks ' walk between grand central terminal and the waldorf astoria hotel in midtown manhattan . colombia alone -- its government , its people , its newspapers -- does_not have the capacity 0 to fight this battle successfully . all drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs . the u.s. , as the major drug consumer , should lead this joint effort . reduction , if not the total cessation , of drug consumption is the requirement for victory . much is being done in colombia 0 to fight the drug cartel mafia . luxurious homes and ranches have_been raided by the military authorities , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have_been seized . more_than 300 planes and helicopters have_been impounded at airports , and a large_number of vehicles and launches has_been confiscated . the military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons , explosives and other war-like materiel . much has_been accomplished and public_opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but , on the other_hand , none of the key drug barons have_been captured . there has_been a_lot of talk that a large portion_of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money . in my opinion , this is not true . laundered drug money has served only to increase , unrealistically , the price of real_estate , creating serious problems for low-income people_who aspire to own their_own homes . drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars , airplanes , launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed . but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial_institutions outside colombia . in fact , the cooperation of those financial_institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle . what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher_prices for colombia 's legitimate products . the price of coffee has gone down almost 45_% since the beginning of the year , to the lowest_level -lrb- after inflation -rrb- since the great_depression . market_conditions point to even lower_prices next_year . the 27-year-old coffee cartel had to be formally dissolved this_summer . as a result , colombia will earn $_500 million less from its coffee this_year than last . our coffee growers face reductions in their income , and this tempts them to contemplate substituting coca crops for coffee . u.s. interests occasionally try_to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export -- cut flowers -- into the american market . a just price and an open_market for what colombian produces and exports should_be the policy of the u.s. . i take_advantage of this opportunity given to me by the wall_street journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper , to become soldiers dedicated to the fight_against the use of drugs . each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge . a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is imperative . mr. cano is president of el_espectador , a newspaper founded by his grandfather .
