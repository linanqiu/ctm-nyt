many_small investors are facing a double whammy this_year : they got hurt_by investing in the highly risky junk_bond market , and the pain is worse because_they did it with borrowed_money . these people invested in `` leveraged '' junk_bond mutual_funds , the publicly_traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk . it 's a good strategy in a rising market , where a 25_% leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125 % of their money working for them . the strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio . trouble is , 0 junk_bond prices have_been weak for months . thus , the leverage has amplified the funds ' portfolio losses . and shares of leveraged junk_funds this_year have_been clobbered even harder than the junk_bonds 0 they hold . `` that 's really where the leverage hurt , ''_says thomas herzfeld , a miami-based investment manager who_specializes in closed-end funds . `` share prices performed even_worse than the funds ' asset_values because fear has_taken hold '' in the junk_market , he_says 0 . leverage is never a problem for the traditional `` open end '' mutual_funds , which are n't publicly_traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all . leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds . the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred_stock , using the proceeds to buy additional bonds . the fallout for investors lately has_been painful . consider the new america high income fund . with a leveraged position of about 45_% , the fund 's share price has plunged 28.5 % so_far this_year . that 's worse_than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio , whose total_return -lrb- bond-price changes plus interest -rrb- has amounted_to a negative 6.08 % . such problems may_not be over . leveraged funds in particular `` are still extremely vulnerable , because we_'re still at the beginning of problems in the junk_market , ''_says 0 george foot , a managing_partner at newgate management associates in northampton , mass . many investors are unaware 0 their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market . `` if someone actually sat down and thought about what they_were being_sold , ''_says gerald perritt , editor of the mutual_fund letter in chicago , they might shy away . in a typical leverage strategy , a fund tries_to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds 0 it buys with the borrowed_money . if the market surges , holders can make that much more profit ; the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors . but when the market moves against the fund , investors lose more_than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount 0 the fund is leveraged . fund_managers , for their part , defend their use of leverage . carl ericson , who_runs the colonial intermediate high income fund , says_0 the fund 's 25_% leverage has jacked up its interest_income . `` as long as i_am borrowing at 9.9_% and each -lcb- bond -rcb- yields over that , it enhances the yield , '' he maintains . mr. ericson says_0 he tries_to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio . yet some funds have pulled in their horns . new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce_its leverage position by buying back $_5 million in preferred_stock and notes from investors . the fund made a similar move earlier_this year . ``_we are trying_to increase our flexibility , ''_says ellen e. terry , a vice_president at ostrander capital_management , the fund 's investment_adviser . she declined to elaborate and would n't_disclose the fund 's recent purchases , sales or cash_position . ms. terry did say_0 the fund 's recent performance `` illustrates what_happens in a leveraged product '' when the market does_n't cooperate . `` when the market turns around , '' she_says 0 , `` it will give a nice picture '' of how leverage can help performance . several leveraged funds do_n't want to cut the amount 0 they borrow because it would slash the income 0 they pay shareholders , fund officials said_0 . but a few funds have_taken other defensive steps . some have raised their cash positions to record levels . high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls . prospect street high income portfolio , for_instance , now holds_about 15_% in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount 0 it held earlier_this year , says_0 john frabotta , portfolio co-manager . he_says 0 the fund , which is 40_% leveraged , has maintained a `` substantial cushion '' between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds . ``_i do_n't want to be in a position 0 to have to sell , '' mr. frabotta says . other funds have recently sold weak junk_bonds to raise_cash . at the 50%-leveraged zenith income fund , portfolio_manager john bianchi recently dumped mesa petroleum , wickes and horsehead industries , among_others , to raise his cash_position to a record 15_% . `` that 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very_much money , '' mr. bianchi says . he concedes : `` this is the most difficult market that i_'ve been involved in . '' because of the recent junk-market turmoil , the fund is_considering investing in other issues instead , including mortgage-backed bonds . ``_we 're_looking at the leverage factor every_day , ''_says robert moore , president of bernstein-macaulay inc. , a shearson_lehman hutton_inc. unit and the fund 's adviser . `` at some point , if we are unable_to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment we_'re right on it -- we_'re going_to have to make a move .
