if a tv weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast , donald h. straszheim surely understands . the chief_economist of merrill_lynch &_co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction . mr._straszheim expects 0 he will_take some heat , and he 's right . since the last time 0 he traveled this way several_months ago , he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession . in february_1988 , for_example , merrill_lynch 's weekly commentary announced that `` the economy is_likely to fall into recession in early 1989 . '' the forecasts were widely disseminated , and , in a splashy ad_campaign launched in the summer of 1988 , merrill_lynch urged investors to buy bonds . it said_0 long-term interest_rates , then above 9_% , could drop to 7_% by the end of 1989 , so bonds , which benefit from falling rates , would_be a good buy . the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40_% to 45_% and later to 55_% . but this september -- just when many market economists , including some at merrill_lynch , believed that mr._straszheim was about to be proved right -- he took a detour if not a u-turn . he softened the talk_about a recession . now , in fact , he is predicting economic_growth of 2.9_% this_year and 2.1 % next_year , a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by blue chip economic_indicators newsletter . and , just recently , merrill_lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50_% . while such changes might sound minor , they_are n't : merrill_lynch manages or oversees some $_300 billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual_funds to individual annuities . two well-known colleagues who believe_0 mr._straszheim was right the first_time are david bostian jr. and a. gary shilling , both of whom run their_own new_york research firms . mr. bostian said in_august that his macroeconomic index signaled recession . mr. shilling , who was merrill_lynch 's chief_economist from 1967 to 1971 , has heralded a recession for months . `` my_own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time 0 he should have doubled his bet , '' he_says . now a rocky stock_market and weak corporate_profits may further threaten the economy . and mr._straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that `` it may_prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time . '' he_adds , `` that 's the forecasting business . '' however risky the business , it 's brisk these_days . pestered by bosses , brokers , clients and media people and pushed by their_own egos , wall_street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator . but the surprisingly durable seven-year economic_expansion has made mincemeat of more_than one forecast . this is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities . this is the commercial version . carrying the new message on the road , mr._straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client . no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time . some smaller clients do_n't seem to notice his switch . but with some clients , the talk can heat up a_bit . dennis o'brien , the treasurer of commonwealth_edison co. in chicago , adopts a polite approach , waiting_for an_opportunity to ask about the forecast . a good half-hour into breakfast at the palmer house , mr. o'brien looks up from his plate after mr._straszheim says something about people_who believe_0 interest_rates are about to nosedive . ``_i 'm one of them who hope 0 they will , with $_6 billion in debt on the books . is that the forecast ? '' mr. o'brien asks , trying_to pin down the economist . he does_n't fully succeed , although mr._straszheim lists an_array of interest-rate scenarios . in a chilly conference room at alliance capital_management in minneapolis , in contrast , the firm 's money_managers seem ready to pin mr._straszheim to the wall . alfred harrison , the manager , shoves mr._straszheim 's handout back at him : `` do we_want to go through this ? or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right ? '' swiveling in his chair , mr._straszheim replies that the new outlook , though still weak , does_n't justify calling a recession right_now . `` it 's all in this handout 0 you_do n't_want to look_at . we could still have a recession '' at some point . one of mr._straszheim 's recurring themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white . sometimes , like now , it 's gray . this somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves one alliance portfolio_manager to ask : `` so , what is this -- a stealth recession ? '' another challenges merrill_lynch 's bond recommendation last_year . ``_we 're_not running that ad_campaign any more , '' mr._straszheim snaps in a rare show of irritation . he_adds , ``_i think_0 it was a fairly decent call . '' explaining his change of mind , mr._straszheim says later , `` it 's hard to pin this on one factor . '' he_says 0 the economy , and especially the employment numbers , look much better_than he expected ; interest_rates have generally declined ; inflation has n't run amok . `` our business is constantly looking_at all these_things , '' he_says . his new forecast calls_for `` a soft_landing . '' and it may_be right , judging from last_week 's report that inflation-adjusted gross_national product rose at a 2.5_% annual_rate in the third_quarter . mr. shilling understands mr._straszheim 's problems . `` there 's unbelievable pressure_on economists to forecast these numbers , '' he_says . `` you make a forecast , and then you become its prisoner . '' it is indeed hard to back away_from a widely publicized forecast , and mr._straszheim is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip . his approach to the recantation is direct but low-key . `` for some time , we had forecast negative third - and fourth-quarter growth . we pulled that forecast , '' he begins matter-of-factly in a meeting with piper , jaffray & hopwood inc. officials in minneapolis , the first stop .
