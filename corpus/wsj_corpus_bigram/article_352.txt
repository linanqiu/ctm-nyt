how interestingly clever of robert goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` days of rage '' in his television critique -lrb- leisure & arts , sept 11 -rrb- . he chastises jo franklin-trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod . '' was not the title very_clear ? one example 0 he gives : `` she_did n't ask '' -lrb- why the palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones -rrb- . really now , did she have to ask ? were not the pictures and happenings , which have_been continuing news headlines , answers enough ? mr._goldberg contends_that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view . of course the palestinians complain_about their treatment ; of course the israelis feel put upon . but his complaint that `` days of rage '' does_n't contain balanced comments from israelis about how badly the palestinians are behaving is irrelevant . it 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white south africans are . this film did emphasize how_long the israeli\/palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of world_war i when the british tried_to guarantee both a jewish state and a palestinian state without specifying how it was to be_done . well , `` days of rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . every issue is multisided . this film attempts_to show a side rarely seen in our media . now we_must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only . salaam . shalom . charlotte carpenter bainbridge island , wash .
