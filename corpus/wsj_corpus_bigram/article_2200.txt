article i , section 7 , clause 2 : every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate , shall , before it becomes a law , be presented to the president of the united_states ; if he approve he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . if after such reconsideration two thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill , it shall_be sent , together with the objections , to the other house , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved_by two thirds of that house , it shall become a law ... . article i , section 7 , clause 3 : every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may_be necessary -lrb- except on a question of adjournment -rrb- shall_be presented to the president of the united_states ; and before the same shall take_effect , shall_be approved_by him , or being disapproved by him , shall_be repassed by two thirds of the senate and house of representatives , according_to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill . president_bush told_reporters a few_months ago that he was looking_for the right test_case to see whether he already_has the line-item_veto . vice_president quayle and budget_director darman said recently 0 they_'ve joined the search . on tuesday , the subject came up again when marlin_fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based_on the provisions above to the white_house press corps . president_bush does_n't have any provision in mind , but line-item-veto bait will_be like earthworms at_midnight in the coming continuing resolution . the harder question is whether anyone yet understands that mr._bush 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as_much as it is about law . we have_been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item_veto since 1987 , when lawyer stephen glazier first made the case on this page . the 1974 budget `` reform , '' passed over president nixon 's veto , took away the presidential impoundment power , thereby introducing monstrous crs and eviscerating the presidential veto . mr. glazier discovered that the founders had worried that congress might take the president out of the loop . article i , section 7 , clause 3 says that whether it 's called an `` order , resolution or vote '' or anything_else , presidents must have the chance to veto . labeling an omnibus budget a `` bill '' ca_n't deprive the president of his power to veto items . finding a test_case should n't be hard , but there_is something 0 to be said for picking the best one possible . the white_house had the perfect case , but congress blinked before it could go to court . after the hud and s&l stories broke , some congressmen began to worry_that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble . they worried_about an interior department directive to log all communications with members or their staffs . congress inserted the following into the interior appropriation : `` none of the funds available under this title may_be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the dept. of the interior and members and committees of congress and their staff . '' the white_house warned_that this would_be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power . when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item_veto , congress caved . the fear 0 congress has of any line-item-veto test led members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this_year , `` this section shall_be effective only on_oct. 1 , 1989 . '' this means 0 interior contacts can_not be logged only on one day -- a sunday that had already passed . if the white_house is looking_for another unconstitutional bill , rep._john dingell is trying again to raise the fairness doctrine from the dead . president_reagan vetoed this as a first_amendment violation . the `` fairness '' doctrine 's enthusiasts are incumbents in the house who know 0 the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts , deterring feisty challengers . there_are also other provisions requiring congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions_on omb . unconstitutional bills make good legal targets , but the line-item_veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers . commenting_on the budget mess this_week , president_bush said : `` the perception out there_is that it 's the fault of congress . and you_can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the american people . '' exactly right . now 's the time 0 to make the political case that presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget . congress is in no position 0 to naysay mr._bush now that we_'re into gramm-rudman 's sequestration . just this_week , the house-senate_conference met -- 231 conferees , divided into 26 different subconferences . senator daniel inouye agreed_to close some bases in hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $ 11 million for a parking_lot at walter reed hospital . conference negotiator rep. bill hefner pulled down $_40 million in military bases for north_carolina and graciously allowed senator james sasser $_70 million for bases in tennessee . president_bush should take the constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work . he should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork . congress may_have lost any sense of discipline , but that does_n't mean_0 the country must learn to live forever with this mess . president_bush has the power to change how washington works , if only he will use it .
