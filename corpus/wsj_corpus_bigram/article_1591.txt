under_attack by its_own listed companies and powerful floor_traders , the new_york stock_exchange is_considering reinstituting a `` collar '' on program_trading that it abandoned last_year , according_to people_familiar with the big_board . the exchange also may step_up its disclosure of firms engaged_in program_trading , these people said_0 . big_board officials would n't_comment publicly . but in an_interview in which he called the stock_market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' big_board chairman_john j._phelan jr. said , ``_we are going_to try_to do some things 0 in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation . mr._phelan has_been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused_by program_trades . he said_0 he is `` very surprised '' by the furor over program_trading and the exchange 's role in it that has raged in recent_days . mr._phelan said that the big_board has_been trying_to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading_strategies entirely , as some investors want , would_be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . '' the exchange has a board_meeting scheduled for tomorrow , and it is_expected that some public announcement could_be made after that . big_board officials have_been under seige from both investors and the exchange 's own floor_traders since the dow_jones industrial_average 's 190-point tumble on_oct. 13 . mr._phelan has n't been making public remarks in recent_days , and many_people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program_trading issue . what the big_board is_considering is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program_trading when the market moves significantly . early last_year , after a 140-point , one-day drop in the dow , the big_board instituted the collar , which banned program_trading through the big_board 's computers whenever the dow moved 50 points up or down in a day . it did_n't work . `` the collar was penetrated on a number_of occasions , '' meaning 0 securities_firms figured out ways_0 to conduct program_trades to circumvent the collar and use the big_board 's electronic trading system , mr._phelan said_0 . that was when the exchange took a new tack by publishing monthly statistics listing the top 15 program_trading firms . exchange officials emphasized that the big_board is_considering a variety_of actions 0 to deal_with program_trading . people_familiar with the exchange said_0 another idea likely_to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program_trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program_trading and who was doing it . meanwhile , another big wall_street brokerage_firm joined others that have_been pulling back from program_trading . american_express co. 's shearson_lehman hutton_inc. unit said_0 it ceased all index-arbitrage program_trading for client accounts . in stock-index_arbitrage , traders buy and sell large_amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index_futures to profit from fleeting price_discrepancies between the two markets . shearson , which in_september was the 11th-biggest program_trader on the big_board , had already suspended stock-index_arbitrage for its_own account . also , cs_first boston inc. 's first_boston corp. unit , the fifth-biggest program_trader in_september , is `` preparing a response '' to the program-trading outcry , officials of the firm said_0 . first_boston is one of the few major wall_street firms that have n't pulled_back from program_trading in recent_days . mr._phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the big_board 's factions . but he has_been getting heat from all sides over program_trading . mr._phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market_volatility from program_trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual_stocks , and from many companies that have shares listed on the big_board . mr._phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just `` how the world is . if bringing the message is a crime , i_'m guilty of it . '' but he said_0 this does_n't mean_0 he is satisfied with the market 's big swings . ``_we 're trying_to take care of a heck of a_lot of constituents , '' mr._phelan said . `` each one has a different agenda . '' for_example , in a special_meeting monday with mr._phelan , senior officials of some of the big_board 's 49 stock specialist_firms complained_that the exchange is no_longer representing their interests . ``_we are_looking for representation 0 we have n't had , '' a specialist said . ``_we 've_had dictation . '' after another session 0 mr._phelan held yesterday with major_brokerage firms such_as morgan_stanley &_co. , goldman , sachs_& co. , painewebber_group inc. and first_boston -- all of which have engaged_in program_trading -- an executive of a top brokerage_firm said , `` clearly , the firms want the exchange to take leadership . '' many specialist_firms resent the big_board 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index in one shot . ultimately , the specialists view this as yet_another step_toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise . `` his -lcb- phelan 's -rcb- own interests are in building an electronic marketplace , '' said a market maker . the basket product , while it has got off to a slow start , is being supported_by some big brokerage_firms -- another member of mr._phelan 's splintered constituency . mr._phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the big_board is serious_about curbing volatility , especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $_200 billion in stock-index_funds , which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the standard_& poor_'s 500 , and which sometimes employ program_trading . the big_board wants to_keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets , but only as long as it `` handles it intelligently , '' mr._phelan said . despite what some investors are suggesting , the big_board is n't even considering a total ban_on program_trading or stock futures , exchange officials said_0 . most revisions 0 it will propose will_be geared toward slowing down program_trading during stressful periods , said_0 officials working with the exchange . computers have made trading more rapid , but that can_be fixed with some fine-tuning . ``_i think_0 if_you -lcb- can -rcb- speed things up , you_can slow them down , '' mr._phelan said . `` that 's different than wrecking them . '' while volatility wo_n't go away , he said_0 , `` volatility is greater_than program_trading . what i_'m trying_to say to people is , 0 it 's proper to worry_about program_trading , but it 's only a piece of the business . '' for_example , mr._phelan said that big institutions have so_much control over public investments that they_can cause big swings in the market , regardless of index_arbitrage . `` a_lot of people would like to go_back to 1970 , '' before program_trading , he said_0 . ``_i would like to go_back to 1970 . but we_'re not_going back to 1970 . '' indeed , mr._phelan said that if stock-market_volatility persists , the u.s. may lose its edge as being the best place 0 to raise capital . `` japan 's markets are more stable , '' he said . `` if that continues , a significant number_of -lcb- u.s. . -rcb- companies will_go over there to raise money . '' in coming days , when the big_board formulates its responses to the program-trading problem , mr._phelan may take a more public role in the issue . lewis l. glucksman , vice_chairman of smith_barney , harris_upham &_co. , said : `` this is a problem that 's taking on a life of its_own . the program_trading situation seems to have driven individual_investors as_well as others out of the market , and even europeans are suspicious . the exchange should take a pro-active position . '' for now , however , mr._phelan said : ``_i refuse to get_out there and tell everybody 0 everything is hunky-dory . we have a major problem , and that problem is volatility .
