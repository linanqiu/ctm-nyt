steel jackets of a type that may_have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the nimitz_freeway had_been installed on at_least a small test section of the double-decker highway last_year by california 's department of transportation , employees familiar_with the project say_0 . the test project -- which reportedly survived tuesday 's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings . state engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns , wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed , that was responsible_for the collapse . the failure in oakland of the freeway segment known_as the cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake , although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might_be significantly_lower than the 250 initially feared . sorting out the wreckage is_expected to take several days . red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried_to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete . giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment , preparing to lift off chunks of the debris . in sacramento , a transportation_department spokesman_said 0 he could_n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work . however , he asserted that the department had n't mastered the technology needed to retrofit the entire cypress structure . moreover , other officials noted , snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may_have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting , even_if it were technologically feasible . knowledgeable employees said_0 the retrofitting , which had n't_yet been budgeted , was part_of a planned , three-stage reinforcement of the cypress structure begun by the california transportation_department several_years ago . the cypress reinforcement project itself was part_of an annual effort to shore_up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes . the state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in southern_california , when numerous bridges collapsed . ``_we had just finished phase two '' of the cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed 0 to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock , a state dot engineer said_0 . after completing installation of the jackets on `` one frame '' of the freeway last_year , the state dot had sent the project over to its sacramento engineers 0 to draw up a final design . knowledgeable employees said_0 the project had_been stymied somewhat by `` the difficulty of designing '' the jackets . the procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel , then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed . the employees also said_0 the project may_have been snagged by budgetary concerns . one preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as_much as $ 50_million . the collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials . gov. george deukmejian , who said_0 he had_been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation . ``_i want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every_day , '' said richard katz , a state legislator who is chairman of the california assembly 's transportation committee . he said_0 he would convene hearings within_two weeks . the cypress structure opened in june 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the san_francisco bay_area , does_not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support . the northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type 0 to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake . transportation_department officials , however , said_0 they_were as surprised as anyone by the cypress destruction . they said_0 previous earthquakes suggested_that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well , although they_were working on ways_0 to bolster them . `` unfortunately , there_is only one laboratory for developing techniques 0 to withstand earthquakes , and that is an earthquake , '' said burch bachtold , san_francisco district director for the transportation_department . he said : ``_we know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would_allow us to '' reinforce the columns .
