interprovincial pipe line co. said_0 it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million canadian-dollar -lrb-_us$ 705.6 million -rrb- expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude_oil is shrinking . interprovincial , canada 's_biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the u.s. , said_0 revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million_barrels a day by 1991 , 8_% lower_than a previous estimate . canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million_barrels a day during 1989 's first_half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . `` the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural_gas , said_0 ronald watkins , vice_president for government and industry relations with interprovincial 's parent , interhome energy inc . mr. watkins said_0 volume on interprovincial 's system is down about 2_% since_january and is_expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . `` there has_been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said . many of canada 's oil and gas producers say_0 the outlook for natural_gas is better_than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . the number_of active drilling rigs in canada is down 30_% from a year_ago , and the number_of completed oil wells is `` down more_than that , due to the increasing focus_on gas_exploration , '' said robert feick , manager of crude_oil with calgary 's independent petroleum association of canada , an industry group . mr. watkins said_0 the main_reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western canada . interprovincial transports about 75_% of all crude produced in western canada , and almost 60_% of interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude . nearly all of the crude_oil that canada exports to the u.s. is transported on interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from edmonton to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great lakes region , including chicago , buffalo , toronto and montreal . canada 's current oil exports to the u.s. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net u.s. crude imports , said_0 john lichtblau , president of the new_york-based petroleum industry research foundation . that ranks canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind saudi_arabia , nigeria and mexico . mr. lichtblau said_0 canada 's declining crude output , combined_with the fast-shrinking output of u.s. crude , will_help intensify u.s. reliance_on oil from overseas , particularly the middle_east . `` it 's very_much a growing concern . but when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said . mr. lichtblau stressed_that the delay of interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo_n't by itself increase u.s. dependence on offshore crude , however , since canadian imports are limited in any_case by canada 's falling output . under_terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would_have required regulatory_approval , interprovincial intended_to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 . the system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million_barrels a day .
