groupe ag 's chairman said_0 the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white_knight if_necessary to repel a raider . amid heavy buying of shares in belgium 's_largest insurer , maurice lippens also warned in an_interview that a white_knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock . since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving ag a market_value of about 105 billion belgian francs_-lrb- $_2.7 billion -rrb- . the most_likely white_knight would_be societe_generale de belgique s.a. , which already_owns 18_% of ag and which itself is controlled_by cie . financiere_de suez , the acquisitive french financial conglomerate . but mr. lippens said_0 a rescue also could involve asahi mutual life_insurance co. , which_owns 5_% of ag . ag is hardly alone in its anxiety . a rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping europe 's once-stately insurance business . worried by european_community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are_rushing to find partners and preparing for price_wars . in west_germany and the netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . in france , suez and axa-midi assurances s.a. both have_been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; suez last_month acquired control of groupe victoire , the sixth-largest european insurance company , after a takeover_battle with cie . industrielle . mr. lippens said_0 the volume of shares changing hands has_grown significantly since mid-september . but he estimated that a raider would_have been_able to amass no more_than 4_% of the shares in recent_months . aside_from exploring plans for joint_ventures or acquisitions , mr. lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them , axa-midi , union des assurances de paris and suez , all based in france . they have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag , '' he said_0 . any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's battlements . a `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50_% of ag , mr. lippens said_0 , and members have agreed_to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares . aside_from generale de belgique and asahi , the syndicate includes antwerpsche hypotheekkas , a belgian savings_bank , and various family interests . a generale spokesman confirmed_that the giant belgian holding_company would_be willing_to raise its stake_in ag should a raider seek_control . asahi officials could_n't be_reached for comment . even without bid talk , this_year 's surge in prices for brussels real_estate has excited interest in ag . the company says_0 those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in belgium .
