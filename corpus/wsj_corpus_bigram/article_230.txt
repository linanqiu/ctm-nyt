at lloyd_'s of london , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper . visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known_as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century london . such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present . lloyd_'s , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation . the 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters , the most_recent of which is last_week 's earthquake in california 's bay_area . at the same_time , lloyd_'s is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business . the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors . `` lloyd_'s is on the ropes , ''_says peter nutting , a lloyd_'s investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence . `` it needs more discipline . it needs to sort itself out . '' most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled investors -lrb- some of them royal -rrb- who , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies . some 1,750 members quit the exchange last_year , more_than triple the number_of resignations in 1987 . names are resigning at an even faster pace this_year . lackluster returns are one_reason . the average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most_recent year for which results are available , was 6.5_% , according_to chatset ltd. , an insurance consulting_firm in london . in 1985 , it was 2.1 % . between 1981 and 1986 , the most_recent five-year period for which figures_are available , lloyd_'s reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future_losses -lrb- $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange_rates -rrb- , more_than double the # 1.35_billion posted in the previous five-year period . many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they_are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe . and catastrophes are getting ever more costly . lloyd_'s claims for the 1988 piper alpha oil-rig disaster in the north_sea , for_instance , may reach $_1 billion . during the five-year period_ended 1986 , roughly 80_% of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according_to chatset consultants . the peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number_of them now . ``_i have wished 0 i could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' betty atkins , a secretary from suburban london , says . ms. atkins , whose lloyd_'s membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981 , belongs to mr. nutting 's dissident group on the outhwaite syndicate , which has_been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims . ms. atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential_losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 . `` if lloyd_'s wants # 70,000 out of me they will have to take everything 0 i_'ve got -- and even then i_do n't_know if it will_be enough , '' she_says . unease is widespread among exchange members . ``_i ca_n't think of any reason 0 to join lloyd_'s now , ''_says keith whitten , a british businessman and a lloyd_'s member since 1979 . `` the downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . '' if profits do_n't improve , mr._whitten says_0 he may quit the exchange . meanwhile , competition_from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying . lloyd_'s is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product_lines such_as primary property and marine insurance . over the past_decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5_billion marine market in london , where half the world 's ships are insured . lloyd_'s 66 %_stake in that market has shrunk to 50_% in that period , according_to an_official at the institute of london underwriters , a lloyd_'s competitor . -lrb- the official asked_not to be named . -rrb- much of the business has gone to the institute , an association of more_than 100 insurers , including cigna_corp. , allianz versicherungs ag of west_germany and britain_'s commercial union assurance plc . lloyd_'s has endured decades of genteel decline . at the peak of its power and influence a century ago , lloyd_'s dominated the insurance world with a 50_% stake . it virtually dictated how ships were to be_built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe . today , lloyd_'s share of the world market , excluding life_insurance , is about 2_% . -lrb- its stake is even smaller if life_insurance is included . -rrb- bigger rivals , such_as aetna and allianz , backed_by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds_of branches , operate more_efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say_0 . though lloyd_'s pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage . even lloyd_'s specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged . only 10_years ago , for_instance , lloyd_'s was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses . but since_1981 , kirk horse insurance inc. of lexington , ky. has grabbed a 20_% stake of the market . ronald kirk , president , says_0 lloyd_'s has suffered because its structure does_n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries . thus , he asserts 0 , lloyd_'s ca_n't react quickly to competition . `` lloyd_'s has lost control of the situation , '' he_says . `` they_are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . '' murray lawrence , lloyd_'s chairman , agrees 0 the exchange faces big challenges . `` this is a watershed time , and we are trying_to plot our way ahead , '' he_says . ``_we have_been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . '' lloyd_'s , he_says 0 , is cut_off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses . by that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such_as certain types_of primary property insurance . the exchange , he_says 0 , must find new products and new markets . that wo_n't be an easy task . tradition is dictator at lloyd_'s . three_years ago , the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind_of modern architecture that britain_'s prince charles has denounced . -lrb- some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -rrb- but along_with such treasured artifacts as lord nelson 's spyglass , lloyd_'s also brought its outmoded ways of doing_business . the lloyd_'s market actively underwrites insurance just 4_1\/2 hours a day , brokers say_0 . underwriting does_n't get under_way until after morning tea at 10 a.m . a two-hour lunch break follows . things wind down at about 4:30 p.m. , just in time for afternoon tea . lloyd_'s vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks . the hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages . sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded_by stacks of policies . brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines , waiting their turn 0 to speak to the underwriters . a broker may_have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on_behalf of the syndicates . it could take six_months for a claim to be_paid . `` the system , ''_says nicholas samengo-turner , a lloyd_'s broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional 0 it drives you mad . '' some maintain 0 underwriters also have_been inept . john wetherell , a lloyd_'s underwriter , says_0 he and his_fellow underwriters underestimated by as_much as 50_% the premiums 0 they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 . `` how unprofessional we_must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he_says . lloyd_'s officials decline to comment_on the matter . more recently , property rates have increased . many at lloyd_'s expect 0 the san_francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . but it will_be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . the magnitude of the exchange 's problems may_not become known for some time because of lloyd_'s practice of leaving the books open for three_years to allow for the settlement of claims . lloyd_'s only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . that year , it posted record pretax_profit of # 650_million , a gain 0 it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims . but mr. lawrence says_0 reported profit will_be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will_be . insurance analysts_say 0 the exchange 's downturn in profitability is_likely to be aggravated by more_than $_600 million in aviation losses -lrb- including the 1988 pan_am airline disaster over lockerbie , scotland -rrb- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from september 's hurricane_hugo . lloyd_'s says_0 the departures of names is n't likely_to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion . mr. lawrence says_0 the drain of funds has_been offset_by an_increase in investments by the remaining names . meanwhile , the exchange has_been trying_to lower costs . -lrb- it recently cut its work_force by 9_% , or 213 . -rrb- but lloyd_'s is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology . mr. wetherell , the underwriter , reckons 0 half of his business could_be transacted by computer , cutting_costs at_least 10_% . though lloyd_'s has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far . competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information . both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies . lloyd_'s overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies . some underwriters have_been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers . lloyd_'s presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such_as the u.k. and canada . but such changes must_be cleared by four internal committees and dozens_of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented . the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand . lloyd_'s is moving forward on some fronts , though . mr. lawrence says_0 the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims . by next_year , all underwriters will_be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper_work on claims .
