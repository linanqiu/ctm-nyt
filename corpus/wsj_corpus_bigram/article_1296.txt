as small_investors peppered their mutual_funds with phone_calls over the weekend , big fund_managers said_0 they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash . unlike the weekend before black_monday , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests . and many fund_managers have built up cash levels and say_0 they will_be buying stock this_week . at fidelity_investments , the nation_'s largest fund company , telephone volume_was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black_monday in 1987 . the boston firm said_0 stock-fund redemptions were running at less_than one-third the level two_years ago . as of yesterday_afternoon , the redemptions represented less_than 15_% of the total cash_position of about $_2 billion of fidelity 's stock funds . `` two_years ago there_were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a_lot of fear around , '' said c. bruce johnstone , who_runs fidelity_investments ' $_5 billion equity-income fund . `` this feels more like a one-shot deal . people are n't panicking . '' the test may come today . friday_'s stock_market sell-off came too_late for many investors to act . some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday_'s close would take_place at today 's closing prices . stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did_n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on black_monday . but fund_managers say_0 they_'re ready . many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines . mario gabelli , for_instance , holds cash positions well_above 20_% in several of his funds . windsor fund 's john neff and mutual series ' michael price said_0 they had raised their cash levels to more_than 20_% and 30_% , respectively , this_year . even peter lynch , manager of fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion magellan fund , the nation_'s largest stock fund , built up cash to 7_% or $ 850 million . one_reason is that after two_years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted_net inflows of money from investors in_august and september . ``_i 've let the money build up , '' mr. lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks 0 he likes . not all funds have raised cash levels , of course . as a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of august , the latest figures available from the investment company institute . that was modestly_higher than the 8.8_% and 9.2 % levels in_august and september of 1987 . also , persistent redemptions would force some fund_managers to dump stocks to raise_cash . but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund_managers said_0 . a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled_back their purchases of stock funds since black_monday . stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent_months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less_than half 1987 levels . `` there 's not nearly as_much froth , '' said john bogle , chairman of vanguard_group inc. , a big valley forge , pa. , fund company . many fund_managers argue_that now 's the time 0 to buy . vincent bajakian , manager of the $_1.8 billion wellington fund , added to his positions in bristol-myers_squibb , woolworth and dun_& bradstreet friday . and today he 'll_be looking to buy drug stocks like eli_lilly , pfizer and american_home products whose dividend yields have_been bolstered_by stock declines . fidelity 's mr. lynch , for his part , snapped_up southern_co. shares friday after the stock got hammered . if the market drops further today , he said_0 he 'll_be buying blue_chips such_as bristol-myers and kellogg . `` if_they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an_opportunity that is `` the kind_of thing 0 you dream about . '' major mutual-fund groups said_0 phone_calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday . but most investors were seeking share prices and other information . trading_volume was only modestly_higher than normal . still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . they hope to_avoid the jammed phone_lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in october_1987 . fidelity on saturday opened its 54 walk-in investor centers across the country . the centers normally are closed through the weekend . in_addition , east_coast centers will open at 7:30 edt this_morning , instead of the normal 8:30 . t._rowe price associates_inc. increased its staff of phone representatives 0 to handle investor requests . the baltimore-based group noted_that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market_funds . but most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather_than in a transaction mode , '' said_0 steven norwitz , a vice_president . and vanguard , among_other groups , said_0 it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through . in an_unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone_lines . ``_we view -lcb- friday_'s -rcb- market decline as offering us a buying_opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at gabelli &_co. funds said over the weekend . the janus group had a similar recording for investors . several fund_managers expect a rough market this_morning before prices stabilize . some early selling is_likely to stem_from investors and portfolio_managers who_want to lock in this_year 's fat profits . stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25_% through september , according_to lipper_analytical services_inc . elaine garzarelli , who_runs shearson_lehman hutton_inc. 's $ 335 million sector analysis portfolio , predicts 0 the market will open down at_least 50 points on technical_factors and `` some panic selling . '' but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors 0 she expects 0 the stock_market wo_n't decline more_than 10_% to 15_% from recent highs . `` this is not a major crash , '' she said . nevertheless , ms. garzarelli said_0 she was swamped with phone_calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders . `` half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but i_'m trying_to talk them out of it . '' she_added , 0 `` if_they all were bullish , i_'d really be upset . '' the backdrop to friday_'s slide was markedly different from that of the october_1987 crash , fund_managers argue 0 . two_years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest_rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say_0 . `` from the investors_' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on black_monday , said_0 stephen_boesel , manager of the $ 580 million t._rowe price growth and income fund . this time , ``_i do_n't think_0 we_'ll get a panic reaction .
