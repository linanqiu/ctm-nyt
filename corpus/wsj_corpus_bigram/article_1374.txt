just when it seemed safe to go_back into stocks , wall_street suffered another severe attack of nerves . does this signal 0 another black_monday is coming ? or is this an_extraordinary buying_opportunity , just like oct._19 , 1987 , eventually turned_out to be ? here 's what several leading market experts and money_managers say about friday_'s action , what_happens next and what investors should do . joseph granville . ``_i 'm the only one who said_0 there would_be an october massacre , all through late august and september , ''_says mr. granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer . `` everyone will tell_you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he_says . `` well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . if_you 're a technician , you obey the signals . right_now they_'re telling me to get the hell out and stay_out . i see no major support until 2200 . i see a possibility of going_to 2200 this_month . '' mr. granville says_0 he would n't even think of buying until at_least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows friday . `` most people , '' he_says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks_like . '' elaine garzarelli . a quantitative analyst_with shearson_lehman hutton_inc. , ms. garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987_crash . friday_'s big drop , she_says 0 , `` was not a crash . this was an october massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . now , as in those two_years , her stock_market indicators are positive . so she thinks_0 the damage will_be short-lived and contained . `` those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , '' she_says . `` this is exactly the same_thing , as far as i_'m concerned . '' thus , she_says 0 , if the dow_jones industrial_average dropped below 2450 , `` it would just be a fluke . my advice is to buy . '' as she calculates it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies_' earnings . she_says 0 that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest_rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' ned davis . friday_'s fall marks the start of a bear market , says_0 mr._davis , president of ned davis research inc . but mr._davis , whose views are widely respected by money_managers , says_0 he_expects no 1987-style crash . `` there was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he_says . `` margin debt was at a record high . there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual_funds . the main thing was portfolio_insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended_to protect an_investor against losses . `` a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . in 1987 , such selling contributed_to a snowball effect . today could even be an up day , mr._davis says_0 , if major_brokerage firms agree to refrain from program_trading . over the next_several months , though , he_says 0 things look bad . ``_i think_0 the market will_be heading down into november , '' he_says . ``_we will_probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . sort of a two-step bear market . '' he_expects the downturn to carry the dow_jones industrial_average down to around 2000 sometime_next year . `` that would_be a normal bear market , '' he_says . ``_i guess 0 that 's my forecast . '' leon g. cooperman . ``_i do_n't think_0 the market is going through another october '87 . i_do n't_think 0 that 's the case at all , ''_says mr. cooperman , a partner at goldman , sachs_& co. and chairman of goldman_sachs asset_management . mr. cooperman sees this as a good time 0 to pick_up bargains , but he does_n't think_0 there 's any need to rush . ``_i expect the market to open weaker monday , but then it should find some stability . '' he ticks off several major differences_between now and two_years ago . unlike 1987 , interest_rates have_been falling this_year . unlike 1987 , the dollar has_been strong . and unlike 1987 , the economy does_n't appear to be in any danger of overheating . but the economy 's slower growth this_year also means 0 the outlook for corporate_profits `` is n't good , '' he_says 0 . `` so it 's a very mixed bag . '' thus , he concludes 0 , `` this is not a good environment 0 to be fully invested '' in stocks . `` if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , i would not do any buying . but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio , so i would look to do some modest buying '' on_behalf of clients . ``_we 're_going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' friday . john kenneth galbraith . `` this is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial_community for recurrent insanity , ''_says mr. galbraith , an_economist . ``_i see this as a reaction to the whole junk_bond explosion , '' he_says . `` the explosion of junk_bonds and takeovers has lodged a_lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather_than equity . this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' nevertheless , he_says 0 a depression does_n't appear likely . `` there_is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose 0 , '' he_says . `` it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the thirties -- much_as the financial_community and the government may try . '' mario gabelli . new_york money_manager mario gabelli , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone . `` companies are still going_to buy companies around the world , '' he_says . examples are `` ford looking_at jaguar , bellsouth looking_at lin_broadcasting . '' these sorts of takeovers do_n't require junk_bonds or big bank_loans to finance them , so mr. gabelli figures 0 they will_continue . `` the market was up 35_% since -lcb- president -rcb- bush took_office , '' mr. gabelli says_0 , so a correction was to be expected . he_thinks 0 another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says_0 he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during friday_'s plunge . `` stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity -lcb- this -rcb- week for guys like me , '' he_says . jim rogers . `` it seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , ''_says mr. rogers , a professor of finance at columbia_university and former co-manager of one of the most_successful hedge funds in history , quantum fund . he_sees `` economic problems , financial_problems '' ahead for the u.s. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . `` friday you could_n't sell dollars , '' he_says . dealers `` would_give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' if the dollar stays weak , he_says 0 , that will add to inflationary pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal_reserve board to ease interest_rates very_much . mr. rogers wo_n't decide_what to do today until he_sees how the london and tokyo markets go . he recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . frank curzio . many_people now claim to have predicted the 1987_crash . queens newsletter writer francis x. curzio actually did it : he stated in writing in_september 1987 that the dow_jones industrial_average was likely_to decline about 500 points the following month . mr. curzio says_0 what_happens now will depend a good deal on the federal_reserve board . if it promptly cuts the discount_rate 0 it charges on loans to banks , he_says 0 , `` that could quiet things down . '' if not , ``_we could go to 2200 very soon . '' frank w. terrizzi . stock_prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , ''_says 0 mr. terrizzi , president and managing_director of renaissance investment_management inc. in cincinnati . renaissance , which manages about $_1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier_this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily u.s. treasury_bills . `` t-bills probably are the right place 0 to be , '' he_says .
