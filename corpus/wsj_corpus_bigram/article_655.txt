just because stamford , conn. , high_school did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does_n't mean_0 the city no_longer owns the work of art , a federal_judge ruled 0 . the mural , now valued_at $_1.3 million according_to appraisers , was tossed in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who were renovating the building . the 100-foot-long mural , painted by james daugherty in 1934 , was commissioned by the federal works project administration . after the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned stamford graduate , it eventually was turned over to hiram hoelzer , a professional art restorer . throughout the 1970s , stamford school and city_officials made no effort to locate the mural . apparently the officials did_n't even know 0 the mural was missing until 1980 , when a researcher found that the painting was in mr. hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it . in 1986 , stamford officials thanked mr. hoelzer for taking care of the mural -- and demanded 0 he return it as_soon as possible . mr. hoelzer , however , sued stamford , claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too_long to reclaim it . but judge louis l. stanton of federal_court in manhattan ruled_that the city could_n't be faulted for waiting too_long because it did_n't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute . the judge also ruled_that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did_n't intend for it to be thrown away and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it . mr. hoelzer did_n't return phone_calls seeking_comment on the judge 's decision . the judge ordered that a hearing be held nov._17 to determine how_much the city should pay mr. hoelzer for his services . mary e. sommer , corporate counsel for stamford , said_0 the city has discussed several possible plans for displaying the mural , which portrays various scenes from the great_depression . she said_0 the mural `` preserves an era in stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done .
