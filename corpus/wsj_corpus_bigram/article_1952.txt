although bullish dollar sentiment has fizzled , many currency analysts_say 0 a massive sell-off probably_wo n't occur in the near_future . while wall_street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest_rates continue to undermine the dollar , weakness in the pound and the yen is_expected to offset those factors . `` by default , '' the dollar probably will_be able_to hold up pretty well in coming days , says_0 francoise soares-kemp , a foreign-exchange adviser at credit_suisse . ``_we 're close to the bottom '' of the near-term ranges , she contends_0 . in late_friday afternoon new_york trading , the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen , off from late_thursday 's 1.8400 marks and 142.10_yen . the pound strengthened to $ 1.5795 from $ 1.5765 . in tokyo monday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 141.70 yen , down from friday_'s tokyo_close of 142.75_yen . the dollar began friday on a firm note , gaining against all major_currencies in tokyo dealings and early european trading despite reports that the bank of japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen . the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation thursday of british chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson . but once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the bank of england and the federal_reserve bank of new_york , the dollar was dragged down , traders_say 0 , by the stock-market slump that left the dow_jones industrial_average with a loss of 17.01 points . with the stock_market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest_rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments , traders_say 0 the dollar is still in a precarious position . `` they_'ll be looking_at levels 0 to sell the dollar , ''_says james scalfaro , a foreign-exchange marketing representative at bank of montreal . while some_analysts say_0 the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen , mr. scalfaro and others do_n't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140_yen soon . predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after mr._lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there_are dollar retreats . with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major_currencies , `` you_do n't have a confirmation '' that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works , says_0 mike malpede , senior currency analyst_at refco inc. in chicago . as far as the pound goes , some traders_say 0 a slide toward support at $ 1.5500 may_be a favorable development for the dollar this_week . while the pound has attempted to stabilize , currency analysts_say 0 it is in critical condition . sterling plunged about four cents thursday and hit the week 's low of $ 1.5765 when mr._lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members . he was succeeded by john major , who friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest_rates that he said `` are working exactly as intended '' in reducing inflation . but the market remains uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects_for the pound , currency analysts contend 0 . although the bank of england 's tight monetary_policy has fueled worries that britain_'s slowing_economy is headed for a recession , it is widely believed that mr._lawson 's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent_weeks . if there_are any signs that mr. major will_be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge , that currency is_expected to fall sharply . `` it 's fair to say_0 there_are more risks for the pound under major than there_were under lawson , ''_says malcolm roberts , a director of international bond_market research at salomon_brothers in london . `` there 's very little upside to sterling , '' mr._roberts says , but he_adds that near-term losses may_be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently has run its course . but some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound , particularly because britain_'s inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual_rate of about 7.6 % and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current_account and trade deficits . the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next_year , says_0 nigel rendell , an international economist_at james_capel &_co. in london . the pound was at 2.8896 marks_late friday , off sharply from 2.9511 in new_york trading a week earlier . if the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks , the bank of england may raise britain_'s base lending rate by one percentage_point to 16_% , says_0 mr. rendell . but such an_increase , he_says 0 , could_be viewed by the market as `` too little too_late . '' the bank of england indicated its desire to leave its monetary_policy unchanged friday by declining to raise the official 15_% discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses , analysts_say 0 . pound concerns aside , the lack_of strong buying_interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar , many traders_say 0 . the dollar has a `` natural base of support '' around 140_yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent_weeks , says_0 ms. soares-kemp of credit_suisse . the yen 's softness , she_says 0 , apparently stems_from japanese_investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries_about this_year 's upheaval in the japanese government . on new_york 's commodity_exchange friday , gold for current_delivery jumped $ 5.80 , to $ 378.30 an_ounce , the highest settlement since_july 12 . estimated_volume was a heavy seven million_ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong monday , gold was_quoted at $ 378.87 an_ounce .
