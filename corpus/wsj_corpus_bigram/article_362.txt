japan 's finance_ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new_york stock-price free_fall . makoto utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , said_0 the ministry did_n't in any way suggest to japanese_banks that they stay_out of the ual_corp. leveraged_buy-out . the ministry has never even suggested_that japanese_banks be cautious_about leveraged_buy-outs in general , mr._utsumi said_0 . `` there_are no facts -lcb- behind the assertions -rcb- that we sent any kind_of signal , '' he declared in an_interview . the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think_0 japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets . a number_of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in new_york stock_prices on_oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the ual_deal for one_reason or another . mr._utsumi said_0 the most 0 the ministry had ever done was ask japanese_banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous u.s. leveraged_buy-out . the ministry inquired about that deal -- which mr._utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of japanese_banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' he said_0 the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he_added that none of the japanese_banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . mr._utsumi also said_0 some japanese_banks were_willing to participate_in the ual financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they_were n't under orders to back out . in general , mr._utsumi said , japanese_banks are becoming_more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . `` each japanese bank has its_own judgment on the profits and risks in that -lcb- ual -rcb- deal , '' he said . `` they_are becoming_more independent . it 's a sound phenomenon . '' sanwa bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate_in the first ual proposal . a sanwa bank spokesman denied that the finance_ministry played any part in the bank 's decision . ``_we made our_own decision , '' he said . still , mr._utsumi may_have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by japanese_banks . all week there has_been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . bank analysts_say 0 ministry officials have_been growing increasingly concerned during the past_few months about japanese_banks getting in over their heads . `` the -lcb- ministry -rcb- thinks_0 the banks do_n't know_what they_are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope_with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked_not to be_identified . `` the -lcb- ministry -rcb- wants to see the japanese_banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged_buy-outs , he_added 0 . although some of the japanese_banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual bowed out because_they found the terms unattractive , observers here say_0 they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason . japanese_banks are under `` political pressure '' as_well , the analyst said_0 . moreover , analysts point_out that japanese_banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if_they offer the chance to build market share , cement an_important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . clearly , some financial authorities are concerned_about the japanese_banks role in leveraged_buy-outs . at a news_conference this_week , bank of japan gov. satoshi sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly_leveraged deals . despite mr. sumita 's statements , it is the finance_ministry , not the central_bank , that makes policy decisions . while recent events may cool some of the leveraged_buy-out fever , japanese_banks are n't likely_to walk away_from the game . despite the risks , the deals can_be an attractive way for japanese_banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market , bank analysts_say 0 . flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to_expand overseas . jumping in on big deals is a high profile way_0 to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network .
