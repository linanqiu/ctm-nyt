for bankers and regulators , arizona is looking more like texas every_day . on friday , los_angeles-based first_interstate bancorp said_0 it_expects a net_loss of $ 16 million for the third_quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its first_interstate bank of arizona unit . first_interstate said_0 the unit , bludgeoned by arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter . first_interstate took a huge $_350 million provision for loan_losses at the arizona bank . it charged off an_estimated $_200 million of arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future_losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real_estate . first_interstate made the move under_pressure from regulators . the action capped a spurt of grim arizona banking news for the third_quarter , and emphatically signaled that arizona is challenging texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard . earlier last_week , valley_national corp. , the state 's_largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend . pinnacle_west capital corp. , which has_been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about pinnacle 's moribund merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter_net income . security_pacific corp. said_0 third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly_because of sour arizona real-estate loans . new_york-based chase_manhattan corp. took an $ 85_million arizona-related charge . furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind first_interstate 's loss suggests 0 regulators have concluded_that lenders ' reserves are far too_low 0 to absorb their future arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do_something about it . examiners from the office of the comptroller of the currency had_been combing through first_interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last_month ; they first recommended that first_interstate take a provision that was less_than the eventual $_350 million third-quarter hit . when first_interstate balked , arguing_that the figure was too_high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $_350 million . `` at that point , -lcb- first_interstate -rcb- decided 0 it was the better part_of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks . thomas p. marrie , chief_financial officer , would n't_comment about the details of the negotiations . he said_0 the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very_clear what they thought_0 was an appropriate number . '' the tough regulatory stance portends large future_losses , especially at the state 's thrifts . at_least six of arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken_over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they_are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses . for_example , western savings_& loan_association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at june_30 . it had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second_quarter . yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real_estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever . it also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't_immediately available , though it is believed to be small . the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion . together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $_1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $_1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion . they have no reserves against the real_estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared_with the levels of reserves 0 banks are moving to set_up . the thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second_quarter . other lenders have_been recovering only 50_cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property , if_they can sell it at all . all this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking . in the late_1970s and early_1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office_buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident_that arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4_% to 6_% for years 0 to come . now , annual population growth is running at about 2_% a year , some desert tracts bought three_years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are_being sold at $_25,000 an acre and phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office_space . `` it 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate 0 that earthquake was n't in phoenix -- it might_have knocked_out some of our empty buildings , '' said c.w. jackson , a prominent arizona businessman with interests in real_estate , banking and many other businesses . many arizona real-estate experts think_0 the worst may_be yet to come . ralph shattuck , publisher of foreclosure update newsletter , said_0 foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in maricopa county , where phoenix is located . that 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : so_far this_month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day . `` it 's frightening , '' mr. shattuck said . moreover , mr. shattuck and others said_0 residential real_estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures . and the generally frail condition of arizona 's lenders means 0 there_is little capital available in the state to shore_up the economy and slow_down the slide . `` it 's reasonable to say_0 there_is not a solvent s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said mr._jackson . ``_we 're_going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end ... . the only_thing 0 a_lot of these lenders can_get out of their mouth now is : ` pay me in 60_days . ' '' first_interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third_quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its texas operations . for the six_months ended_june 30 , it reported_net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a_share , including $ 46 million from tax_credits and accounting changes . the bank 's arizona unit holds_about $_6 billion of first_interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets . mr. marrie said_0 the bank expects arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40_% over the last_year , to fall another 20_% before stabilizing . some in arizona think_0 that may_be optimistic . first_interstate said_0 its operations outside of arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did_n't specify the results . first_interstate stock closed_at $ 57.625 , down_25 cents , in composite_trading friday on the new_york stock_exchange . since its unsuccessful bid for bankamerica_corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an_effort to cut_costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe_0 it may_be ripe for a takeover_bid , especially with interstate_banking set to begin in california in 1991 . mr. marrie said_0 the problems in arizona have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . '' separately , standard_& poor_'s corp. lowered_its ratings on valley_national corp. 's senior debt to double-b from double-b-plus , affecting about $_300 million of long-term_debt . s&p also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed_by a letter of credit from the bank_holding company 's principal unit , valley_national bank of arizona . the ratings service said_0 the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial_condition . a spokesman for phoenix , ariz.-based valley_national , said_0 the concern will_be able_to withstand the current downturn in arizona_real estate . commercial_paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said_0 , and consumer deposits have_been up in the last few_days .
