after coming close to a partial settlement a year_ago , shareholders who filed civil_suits against ivan_f. boesky and the partnerships 0 he once controlled again are approaching an accord , people_familiar with the case said_0 . meanwhile , within the next_few weeks , the limited_partners in ivan_f. boesky &_co . l.p. are_expected to reach a partial settlement with drexel_burnham lambert_inc. regarding the distribution of the $ 330 million in partnership assets , said_0 one of the individuals . under the terms of the settlement , the limited_partners would drop their civil_suits against drexel , now pending in federal_court in new_york , another individual said_0 . attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they_were a year_ago , when reports of an_imminent agreement circulated . one individual said_0 the shareholders_' accord was `` well worked_out . '' however , less optimistic attorneys warned_that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims , there_is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart . a shareholders_' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands_of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider_trading by boesky &_co. , once the largest arbitrage fund in the u.s. . the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which mr._boesky and his partnerships were dealing . some claim 0 they suffered losses because_they sold while he was buying and others because_they bought while he was selling . stocks involved in the shareholder suits include union_carbide , rjr_nabisco , american natural_resources , boise cascade corp. , general_foods corp. , houston natural_gas and fmc corp . there_are at_least 27 class-action shareholder suits that have_been consolidated in federal_court in new_york under u.s._district judge milton pollack . among the defendants are mr._boesky ; the now-defunct ivan_f. boesky &_co. ; mr._boesky 's main underwriter , drexel_burnham ; and cambrian & general securities plc , a british investment fund once controlled_by mr._boesky . individuals_familiar with the negotiations said_0 the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the boesky partnership , the british fund and mr._boesky as defendants , while drexel and other defendants would remain . charles davidow , of the washington , d.c.-based law_firm wilmer , cutler & pickering , which_represents mr._boesky in this matter , said only that `` discussions are under_way . there_are no agreements yet . '' it has_been three_years since mr._boesky , now in prison , agreed_to pay a $_100 million fine to_settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information . out of this , the government set_up a $ 50_million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses . according_to william orbe , an_attorney at grais & richards , the escrow agents for the fund , as of sept._30 the fund amounted_to $ 60.5 million . separately , attorneys for the 42 or so limited_partners have had serious discussions that could_lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets . the limited_partners include insurance_companies , financial_institutions and individual_investors . an_agreement with drexel regarding the limited_partners ' investments is an essential step_toward getting their money back . this is because a delaware court earlier_this year said that drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same_time as the limited_partners . drexel is owed $ 20 million by the partnership . an individual familiar_with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited_partners do not recoup from the $ 330 million in partnership assets , they will_receive from the $_350 million restitution fund available as a result of drexel 's settlement with the government in december 1988 . drexel agreed_to plead_guilty to six felony counts and pay $_650 million , of which $_350 million was set_aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs , including the limited_partners , who claim 0 they_were injured by drexel . jailed african-american activist wins a battle against the u.s._district judge robert p. patterson jr. ordered the fbi to immediately begin processing herman benjamin ferguson 's_request for documents stemming_from the agency 's investigation of him during the 1960s . the fbi had said_0 it would not be_able to begin processing the request until june mr. ferguson , who is 68 years_old , fled the u.s. in 1970 after exhausting his appeals of a 1968 conviction on conspiracy to murder . he turned himself in to authorities in new_york earlier_this year . he maintains that the information from the fbi will_help him get his 1968 conviction vacated and his bail-jumping indictment dismissed . his attorneys claim 0 he was framed by the fbi and new_york police as_part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s . because the federal freedom of information act was n't law at that time , the fbi was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when mr. ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s . but in federal_court in manhattan , judge patterson said_0 the fbi records could show that mr. ferguson 's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices . the judge said that if the fbi 's proposed schedule was followed in releasing the documents , `` a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his 3 1\/2-year minimum sentence by the time 0 he receives the files . '' gabriel w. gorenstein , the assistant_u.s. attorney handling the case for the fbi , said_0 no decision has_been made about appealing the judge 's ruling . federal courts urged to cut_costs and reduce delays of civil_suits . the study , conducted by a task_force of the brookings institution , suggests_that congress should require the courts to develop the plans . the study was initiated by senate_judiciary committee_chairman joseph biden -lrb-_d. , del . -rrb- . the washington , d.c. , think tank recommends that the courts adopt different `` tracks '' for different types_of civil_cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones . complex cases , such_as antitrust suits and many business disputes , would_receive intense supervision by federal judges to_keep pretrial proceedings moving . standard cases would_require less judicial attention , and fast-track cases could_be resolved quickly . the study also said_0 each federal_court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence , ranging_from as_much as 100 days for cases in the fast track to as_much as 18_months for complex disputes . and the study said_0 federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process . to take_advantage of local expertise and custom , the study said_0 , congress should require each of the 94 federal_district courts to adopt its_own plan to speed the handling of civil_suits and to reduce the high costs in civil_cases . although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects , the makeup of the task_force was unusually diverse , adding significance to the effort . it included lawyers from civil_rights and consumer groups , plaintiffs_' lawyers and defense attorneys , corporate counsel and law professors .
