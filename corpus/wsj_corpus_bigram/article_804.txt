bally manufacturing corp. and new_york developer_donald trump have agreed in_principle to a $ 6.5_million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming_from bally 's alleged greenmail payment to mr._trump . according_to lawyers familiar_with the settlement_talks , the verbal agreement to end a lawsuit filed more_than two_years ago was reached last_week and will soon be submitted to a federal_judge in camden , n.j . in february 1987 , bally thwarted a possible hostile_takeover bid from mr._trump by agreeing to buy 2.6_million of mr._trump 's 3.1_million bally shares for $ 83.7 million -- more_than $ 18 million above market price . the term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium_over market_value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer . lawyers for shareholders , bally and mr._trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement , citing a request by a federal_court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed . but some attorneys who are familiar_with the matter said_0 the $ 6.5_million payment will_be shared by bally and mr._trump , with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money . the amount 0 bally and mr._trump will pay to_settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the $ 45 million 0 walt_disney co. and saul steinberg 's reliance group holdings_inc. agreed_to pay to_settle a similar suit in july . that settlement represented the first_time 0 shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case . mr._steinberg made a $ 59.7 million profit on the sale to disney of his investment in the company in 1984 . but lawyers said_0 mr._steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because , when he sued disney during his takeover_battle , he filed on_behalf of all shareholders . when disney offered to pay mr._steinberg a premium for his shares , the new_york investor did_n't demand 0 the company also pay a premium to other shareholders . when mr._trump sued bally , he sued only on_behalf of himself . mr._trump and bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of delaware , where bally is incorporated , courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule . that rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal_with dissident shareholders . senate hears final arguments in impeachment trial of federal_judge . yesterday , u.s. judge alcee hastings faced his jury -- the full u.s. senate -- and said , ``_i am not guilty of having committed any crime . '' seventeen articles of impeachment against the florida judge , one of the few blacks on the u.s. bench , were approved_by the house in_august 1988 . the central charge_against judge_hastings is that he conspired with a washington lawyer to_obtain a $_150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge , in return for leniency . he is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap 0 he supervised . the senate 's public gallery was packed with judge_hastings ' supporters , who erupted into applause after he finished his argument . judge_hastings , who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in_1983 , claims 0 he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against_him constitute double jeopardy . but rep._john bryant -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- , the lead counsel for the house managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into judge_hastings ' activities , said `` a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt . '' the senate will deliberate behind closed doors today and is_scheduled to vote_on the impeachment tomorrow . if the judge is impeached , as is thought likely , he will_be removed from office immediately . however , judge_hastings has said_0 he will_continue to fight and is contemplating an_appeal of any impeachment to the u.s. supreme_court . companies seeking to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory . in a case_involving avondale industries_inc. and its insurer , travelers cos. , the second u.s. circuit_court of appeals in new_york ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say_0 are central to dozens_of pollution cases around the country . travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup_costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies . they also have argued_that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility do_n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit ; thus , such governmental proceedings are n't covered_by the policies , the insurers say_0 . the appeals_court disagreed on both counts . avondale was notified by louisiana officials in 1986 that it was potentially responsible_for a cleanup at an oil-recycling plant . avondale asked travelers to defend it in the state proceeding , but the insurer did_n't respond . the appeals_court upheld a district_judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings . the appeals_court also said , 0 ``_we think_0 an ordinary businessman reading this policy would_have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage_claims '' stemming_from any cleanup . `` this decision will have a very considerable impact , '' said_0 kenneth abraham , professor of environmental law and insurance law at the university of virginia , because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in new_york . william greaney , an_attorney for the chemical manufacturers association , said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup_costs are damages , the influence of the appeals_court in new_york `` will make insurers sit up and listen . '' he said_0 the decision was the first in which a federal_appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation . barry r. ostrager , an_attorney for travelers , said , `` there_are procedural bases on which this case will_be appealed further . '' new_york 's poor face nearly three million legal problems a year without legal help . that is the conclusion of a report released by the new_york state bar_association . the report was based_on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state , a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field . `` the report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions , '' said joseph genova , chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law_firm of milbank , tweed , hadley & mccloy . according_to the study , slightly_more than 34_% of those surveyed reported having at_least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help . nearly 36_% ranked housing problems as their most serious unmet legal need . other_areas targeted by the survey 's respondents included difficulty obtaining or maintaining public benefits -lrb- 22_% -rrb- , consumer fraud -lrb- 15.4 % -rrb- , and health-care issues -lrb- 15_% -rrb- . during the 15-month survey , 43_% of all legal-services programs said that at some period they_were unable_to accept new clients unless_they had an_emergency . mr. genova said_0 the committee may meet to propose solutions to the problems identified in the study . prosecutor to join gibson dunn : assistant_u.s. attorney randy mastro , who headed the government 's racketeering case against the international brotherhood of teamsters , will join gibson , dunn & crutcher in its new_york office . mr. mastro has_been with the new_york u.s._attorney 's office for nearly five_years . in 1987 he became deputy chief of the civil division . mr. mastro will do civil litigation and white-collar defense work for gibson dunn , which is based in los_angeles . former apple_computer inc. general_counsel john p. karalis has joined the phoenix , ariz. , law_firm of brown_& bain . mr. karalis , 51 , will specialize in corporate law and international law at the 110-lawyer firm . before joining apple in 1986 , mr. karalis served_as general_counsel at sperry corp .
