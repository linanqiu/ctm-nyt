anheuser-busch cos. said_0 it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands , setting the stage for a potentially bruising price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow . anheuser , the world 's_largest brewer and u.s. market leader , has historically been reluctant_to engage_in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume . with the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales , however , the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry . over the summer , anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry_observers have seen for a long time . some experts now predict 0 anheuser 's entry_into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players . the st._louis company said major rivals , philip_morris co. 's miller_brewing unit and adolph coors co. `` have_been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at_least the past 18_months '' on their premium brands , pricing their product as_much as 25_cents a 12-pack below anheuser 's budweiser label in many markets . anheuser said_0 it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis . anheuser-busch announced its plan at the same_time 0 it reported 0 third-quarter_net income_rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2_% to $ 238.3 million , or 83_cents a_share , from $ 226.5 million , or 78 cents . third-period sales were $ 2.49 billion , up from last_year 's $ 2.34 billion . anheuser said_0 its new strategy -- started in some markets last_month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990 . the projection sent anheuser shares plunging $ 4.375 in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading yesterday . the stock closed_at $ 38.50 on heavy_volume of about 3.5_million shares . shares of coors , the company 's sole publicly_traded major competitor , fell $_1.50 apiece to $ 19.125 in national_over-the-counter trading , apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle . anheuser noted_that `` beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s , with sales volume being essentially_flat '' while consolidation creates fewer , bigger players . ``_we can_not permit a further slowing in our volume trend , '' anheuser said , adding 0 it will_take `` appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy '' for the premium brands . anheuser said_0 it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50_% u.s. market share by the mid-1990s . beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant , which last_year accounted_for about 41 % of all u.s. beer sales and is_expected to see that grow to 42.5 % in the current year . `` anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar , and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl , '' said joseph j. doyle , an_analyst with smith_barney , harris_upham &_co . `` it 's going_to get bloody . '' jerry steinman , publisher of beer marketers insights , a trade newsletter , said_0 anheuser 's announcement means 0 `` everybody else in the industry is going_to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives . '' prudential-bache_securities inc. analyst george e. thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement , and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending `` cola wars , '' unwarranted . mr._thompson calls discounting `` a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share , '' and projected that anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle . mr._thompson noted_that the disappointing_earnings , which fell five_cents a_share short of his_own projections , contributed_to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public . but smith_barney 's mr. doyle , who yesterday trimmed his 1990 anheuser earnings projection to $ 2.95 a_share from $ 3.10 , called the market 's reaction `` justified . '' while the third-quarter_earnings were a `` moderate disappointment , '' he said_0 , `` the real bad_news is the intensity of price competition '' in the premium-beer sector . according_to mr. steinman , the newsletter publisher , anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor , miller_brewing , which had a 21.2 %_stake last_year . it 's followed_by stroh brewery co. , which has_agreed to sell its assets to coors . both coors and stroh have recently been ceding market share to miller and anheuser .
