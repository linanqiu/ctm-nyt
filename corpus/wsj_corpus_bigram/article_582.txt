the disarray in the junk-bond_market that began last_month with a credit crunch at campeau_corp. has offered commercial_banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers . but two big new_york banks seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of citicorp and chase_manhattan corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank_financing for a leveraged_buy-out of united_airlines parent_ual corp . for more_than a decade , banks have_been pressing congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities_firms in playing wall_street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield_junk bonds . those expanded powers reached their zenith in july when bankers_trust new_york corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank_loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged_buy-out of northwest_airlines parent nwa inc . one of the major selling points used by los_angeles financier alfred checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did_n't include any junk_bonds . that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover . all $_3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks . charles nathan , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at salomon_brothers inc. , says_0 it is natural for banks to try_to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs . but the ual collapse , he_says 0 , `` may tell_you 0 it 's not_going to work that easily . '' david batchelder , a mergers adviser in la_jolla , calif. , who aided los_angeles investor_marvin davis on the bids which put both ual and nwa in play as takeover candidates this_year , says that banks have_been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . '' mr. batchelder says that in the past , banks would normally have loaned 65_% of a total buy-out price , with the loans secured by the target company 's assets . another 20_% of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk_bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank_loans . mr. checchi 's purchase of nwa , mr. batchelder notes 0 , `` was probably the most aggressive to date , '' with bank_debt at 85_% of the purchase_price . but mr. batchelder says that citicorp 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the ual bank_debt for a labor-management_buy-out group `` is very distressing to potential users of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial_banks . '' his_client , mr._davis , used just such a letter from citicorp in pursuing ual ; citicorp later agreed_to work with a competing ual_buy-out group . executives of citicorp and chase_manhattan declined to comment_on either the ual situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers . in the wake_of campeau 's problems , prices of junk_bonds tumbled , throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk_bond sales . mark solow , senior managing_director at manufacturers_hanover trust_co. , says_0 the falloff in junk_bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers . but he warns that banks will have `` to have enough discipline '' 0 not to make loans that are too risky . in fact , manufacturers_hanover said in its third-quarter_earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . ``_we did_n't take part in a_lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , ''_says a bank spokesman . james b. lee , head of syndications and private placements at chemical_banking corp. , said_0 he_believes 0 banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance . as evidence , he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $_3 billion bid for american_medical international_inc. in which chemical served_as both the lead bank and an equity investor . beyond the current weakness in the junk_bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers . arthur fleischer jr. , a takeover lawyer at fried frank harris shriver & jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has_developed against junk_bonds . one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk_bonds was paramount_communications inc. in its initial offer to_acquire time inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a_share . a paramount spokesman says_0 that decision was based_on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk_bonds . but some observers believe_0 paramount chairman martin davis wanted to_avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time . in the end , mr._davis used junk_bonds so that he could raise paramount 's bid to $_200 a_share . some monday-morning quarterbacks said_0 the initial lower bid , without junk_bonds , was a factor in his losing the company . time eluded paramount by acquiring warner_communications inc . the success of the nwa financing , and the failure of the ual_deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese_banks . japanese_banks accounted_for 50_% of the nwa bank_debt , according_to a report by transportation_secretary samuel skinner . but it was broad-scale rejection by japanese_banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt_to buy ual . citicorp and chase are attempting_to put_together a new , lower bid . takanori mizuno , chief_economist of the institute for financial affairs inc. , a tokyo research_center on finance and economics , says , `` the junk_bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of lbo companies .
