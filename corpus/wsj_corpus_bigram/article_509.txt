nelson bunker hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade_ago is still haunting the market in this metal . silver , now trading around $_5 an_ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an_ounce in january 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . `` mr._hunt 's attempt_to squeeze the silver market 10_years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , ''_says lesley edgar , managing_director of sharps pixley ltd. , london bullion brokers . while some 100_million ounces of silver once held by mr._hunt and middle eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , mr. edgar says_0 . photographic developers , for_example , bought equipment 0 to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44_% of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes . japanese and u.s. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and x-rays that do_n't require silver , dealers_say 0 . silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers_say 0 . even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such_as treasury_bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers_say 0 . although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock_markets earlier_this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious_metals are out of favor for the moment because of high_interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers_say 0 . silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . some_analysts contend_that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s . `` bargain hunters believe_that silver offers the best value amongst precious_metals , ''_says frederick r. demler , analyst_at drexel_burnham lambert_inc . a further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the u.s. , he_says 0 . scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from india and the soviet_union . silver prices could also be boosted_by strikes in leading producing nations peru and mexico , mr. demler says_0 . meanwhile , total fabrication demand_for silver has_risen six_years in a row , he_says 0 . japanese demand grew by 70_% in the first_half of this_year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will_require 4.5 million_ounces . compared_with huge annual surpluses of more_than 100_million ounces in the first_half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , mr. demler says_0 . despite intermittent rallies in the past_few years , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range . `` there 's just too_much silver around , ''_says tom butler , an_analyst at samuel montagu &_co. , a london bullion house . a huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at_least 617 million_ounces is the market depressant , says_0 shearson_lehman hutton_inc. in a report . this_year alone , inventories at the commodity_exchange of new_york jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million_ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says_0 rhona o'connell , london-based precious_metals analyst_at shearson_lehman hutton . `` silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' ms. o'connell says . moreover , while asian and middle eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does_n't have the same mystique , dealers_say 0 . investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they_are far_more partial to gold , says_0 urs seiler , senior_vice president at union bank of switzerland . yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he_says 0 . however , dealers caution that any increase would_be $_1 to $_2 at most . looking_ahead to other_commodity markets this_week : livestock and meats analysts_expect the prices of live cattle futures_contracts to rise in trading today in the wake_of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots . after the close of trading_friday , the agriculture_department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on_oct. 1 , down 6_% from that date a year_earlier . most analysts had expected the government to report a 4_% decline . feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef . the government reported that the number_of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5_% compared_with the year-earlier_quarter . many industry analysts had_been projecting a 3_% decline in placements for the quarter . in the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches . the number_of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable . a shortage of young cattle has made them more_expensive for feedlot operators to buy . the agriculture_department also said that the number_of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5_% from the 1988 quarter , which was in line with projections by analysts . energy friday_'s 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $ 19.98 in the expiring november contract for west_texas intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this_week in petroleum futures on the new_york mercantile_exchange . most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical_factors associated_with the contract 's going off the board . others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next_several trading sessions . barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm . copper copper prices_fell sharply friday_afternoon . for_example , copper for december_delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . on friday , one_analyst said_0 , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the highland_valley mine in british_columbia . in mexico , the analyst added , employees at the cananea mine , who have_been out of work since late august when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35_% cut in the 3,800-man work_force . the mine is_expected to return to production in about a week . on friday , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in london , which takes place at noon edt . the premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand_for cash copper . long-term support for the december_contract was believed to be at $_1.25 a pound . a technical analyst said_0 there_were a number_of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . that brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . `` in general , it was a bearish close , '' said ben hanauer , a copper trader_at rudolph wolff &_co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage_firm . but whether this price break has implications for this_week , he said_0 , ``_we will know more when the london metal exchange copper stock levels are released monday_morning . '' another analyst said_0 he expected lme inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . bernard savaiko , senior commodities analyst_at painewebber_inc. , said that when traders saw 0 the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower lme stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . he also_noted that the japanese , who had_been buying at prices just above the $_1.25 level , apparently pulled_back from the market on friday . mr._savaiko said_0 he_sees a possibility of the december_contract dropping to $_1.05 a pound .
