concerning your_sept. 19 article `` wall_street firms link analysts_' pay to performance , '' i_'m delighted that wall_street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world . if the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability_to see into the future is fragile at best ? why_not extend the same harsh standards to the sales_force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based_on how_much money they made for their_clients during the year ? that should stop a_lot of account-churning , and produce a stock_market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense . now , would n't that be a novelty . phyllis kyle stephenson newport news , va .
