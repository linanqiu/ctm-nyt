small_businesses say_0 a recent trend is like a dream come true : more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance , initially at_least . but then they wake up to a nightmare . the reasonable first-year rates can_be followed_by increases of 60_% or more if a covered employee files a major claim , they complain . insurance premiums for one small maryland concern went_up 130 % in less_than two_years , the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk . `` there 's a distinct possibility that i may lose my job over this , '' the employee , karen allen , of floor covering resources , kensington , md. , recently told a congressional_hearing . she said_0 her employer ca_n't afford the rate_increases , and she fears 0 she wo_n't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment . for employee and employer alike , the worry is widespread . surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health_insurance as one of their biggest concerns . the house energy and commerce_committee 's health subcommittee , headed_by democratic rep. henry waxman of california , is looking into complaints that small_businesses not_only ca_n't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed , but often ca_n't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable . ``_i have an old-fashioned name for people in that position : sick people_who need health_insurance , '' rep. waxman says . `` what we_'re seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance : collect premiums from the healthy , dump the sick and let_them pay their_own bills . '' some lawmakers may_seek legislation 0 to limit overly restrictive insurance policies . the concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market . as larger companies increasingly self-insure , or use reserves to pay their_own workers_' medical bills , the insurance industry has_turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them . `` insurance_companies will offer a good rate if no_one is sick , but it 's a roll of the dice , ''_says rosemary heinhold of the small_business service bureau , a group representing 35,000 small_businesses nationwide . `` one case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant , and rates go up 40_% to 60_% . small-business people end_up paying insurance premiums worth two to three_times the cost of one illness . '' in_addition , the group says_0 some of its member companies have_been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged_from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce , hemorrhoids and overweight . the health_insurance association of america , an insurers ' trade_group , acknowledges_that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely_to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market . but it says that rapid rate_increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health_care . some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market . they say_0 insurance_companies use policies aimed_at excluding bad risks because their competitors do . but the general practice makes it more_difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups , thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums . ``_i 'm_not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty , '' robert patricelli of the u.s. chamber of commerce told mr. waxman 's panel . `` you_ca n't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace . '' rep. waxman and democratic_sen. edward_kennedy of massachusetts have proposed regulation 0 to deal_with the problem . the proposal is just part_of legislation that would_require businesses to provide health_benefits , an idea that is strongly_opposed by small_business who say_0 it would just compound the insurance-cost problems . but small-business lobbyists say_0 they support the idea , included in the kennedy-waxman bill , of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating , which pegs rates to the use of health_care by a community or other large group , and is designed to prevent insurance_companies from taking only low-risk small_companies as clients . but first on the list of priorities , says_0 the national federation of independent business , is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items , such_as psychiatric care , in basic health plans . such requirements , they_argue 0 , make it difficult to provide a basic , low-cost health-benefits package . `` before the state of wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be_covered , there_were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state ; now there_are 400 , ''_says carolyn miller , an nfib lobbyist . she contends_that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20_% in maryland and 30_% in california . the insurance-industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating , which `` does_n't save one dollar , '' argues james dorsch , hiaa 's washington counsel . `` it just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive to_keep his workers healthy . '' mr. dorsch says_0 the hiaa is working on a proposal to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism 0 to help cover small groups that ca_n't get insurance without excluding certain employees . the complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict . but to ms. allen , the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance-rate increase , the issue was simple . `` what good is having health_insurance , '' she asked , `` when it 's so expensive that it becomes impossible 0 to_keep after only one major claim ?
