program_trading is `` a racket , ''_complains 0 edward egnuss , a white plains , n.y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small_investor , that 's for sure . '' but although he_thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts 0 it could_be stopped . mr. egnuss 's dislike of program_trading is echoed by many_small investors interviewed by wall_street journal reporters across the country . but like mr. egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt 0 it should_be . ``_i think_0 program_trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , ''_says leo fields , a dallas investor . he notes that program_traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual_investors do and that they often can figure_out earlier where the market is heading . but he blames program_trading for only some of the market 's volatility . he also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk_bonds . he_adds : `` the market may_be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . '' or , as dorothy arighi , an interior decorator in arnold , calif. , puts it : `` all_kinds of funny things spook the market these_days . '' but she believes that `` program_trading creates deviant swings . it 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . '' she adds that legislation curbing it would_be `` a darned good_idea . '' at the charles_schwab &_co. office in atlanta 's buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program_trading . citing the october_1987 crash , glenn miller says , `` it 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no_one did anything . '' a. donald anderson , a 59-year-old los_angeles investor who says_0 the stock_market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does_n't see much point in outlawing program_trading . those_who still want to do it `` will just find some way_0 to get around '' any attempt_to curb it . similarly , rick wamre , a 31-year-old asset manager for a dallas real-estate firm , would like to see program_trading disappear because ``_i ca_n't see that it_does anything for the market or the country . '' yet he is n't in favor of new legislation . ``_i think_0 we_'ve got enough securities_laws , '' he_says . ``_i 'd much rather see them dealing_with interest_rates and the deficit . '' peter anthony , who_runs an employment agency in new_york , decries program_trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure_0 it should_be more strictly regulated . ``_i do_n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would_be like denouncing capitalism , '' he_explains . and surprising numbers of small_investors seem to be adapting to greater stock_market volatility and say_0 they_can live with program_trading . glenn britta , a 25-year-old new_york financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says_0 he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . '' he_adds that program_trading `` increases liquidity in the market . you_ca n't hold back technology . '' and the practice should n't be stopped , he_says 0 , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program_trading . '' also in new_york , israel silverman , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program_trading `` increases volatility , but i_do n't_think 0 it should_be banned . there 's no culprit here . the market is just becoming_more efficient . '' arbitraging on differences_between spot and futures_prices is an_important part_of many financial_markets , he_says 0 . he_adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual_fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund . but ``_i 'm a long-term investor , '' he_says . `` if_you were a short-term investor , you might_be more leery about program_trading . '' jim enzor of atlanta defends program_trading because he_believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge . `` if we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` buy , ' '' he_explains . `` if_you could_get the rhythm of the program_trading , you could take_advantage of it . '' what else can a small_investor do ? scott taccetta , a chicago accountant , is going into money-market_funds . mr. taccetta says_0 he had just recouped the $_5,000 0 he lost in the 1987_crash when he lost more money last oct._13 . now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first_quarter of 1990 . in october , before the market dropped , mrs. arighi of arnold , calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will_be able_to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused_by program_trading . she believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . '' lucille gorman , an 84-year-old chicago housewife , has_become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts . mrs. gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987_crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the oct._13 plunge . `` my stocks are all blue_chips , '' she_says . `` if the market goes down , i figure 0 it 's paper profits 0 i_'m losing . on the other_hand , if it goes way sky high , i always sell . you_do n't_want to get yourself too upset about these_things .
