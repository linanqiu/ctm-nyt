the u.s. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed south_korea , taiwan and saudi_arabia from a list of countries 0 it is closely watching for allegedly failing_to honor u.s. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights . however , five other_countries -- china , thailand , india , brazil and mexico -- will_remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an_interim review , u.s._trade representative_carla hills announced 0 . under the new u.s._trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if_they do_n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next_spring . mrs._hills said_0 many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue . she said_0 there_is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -lcb- offending -rcb- country 's own citizens . '' u.s._trade negotiators argue_that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could_be hurting themselves by discouraging their_own scientists and authors and by deterring u.s. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there . mrs._hills lauded south_korea for creating an intellectual-property task_force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to_pursue movie and book pirates . seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures 0 to aid these teams , she said_0 . taiwan has improved its standing with the u.s. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation 0 to_protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films . that measure could compel taipei 's growing_number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films . saudi_arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible_with international standards and to apply the law to computer_software as_well as to literary works , mrs._hills said_0 . these three countries are n't completely off the hook , though . they will_remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other_countries . those countries --_including japan , italy , canada , greece and spain -- are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list . gary hoffman , a washington lawyer specializing_in intellectual-property cases , said_0 the threat of u.s. retaliation , combined_with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by south_korea , taiwan and saudi_arabia . `` what this tells us is that u.s._trade law is working , '' he said . he said_0 mexico could_be one of the next countries 0 to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law . mrs._hills said that the u.s. is still concerned_about `` disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia . '' she_did n't_elaborate , although earlier u.s._trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in malaysia and disregard for u.s. pharmaceutical patents in turkey . the 1988 trade act requires mrs._hills to issue another review of the performance of these_countries by april 30 . so_far , mrs._hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act .
