national_convenience stores_inc. , trying_to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business , said_0 it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18_months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores . as_part of the plan , the houston-based company 's 1,100 stop 'n go stores will_be refocused to target black , hispanic , upscale or core middle-class customers . stores in upper-income neighborhoods , for_instance , will carry high-priced wines , publications such_as vanity fair , gourmet pasta sauces , oat bran cereals and weight watchers and pritikin products . stores in hispanic areas will stock an assortment of spanish-language magazines , mexican cooking items and candies . stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water . v.h. van horn , national_convenience president and chief_executive officer , said_0 the move reflects the company 's realization that the industry 's poor performance stems_from its failure to give customers what they_want -- rather_than from increasing competition_from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores . `` convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences , '' he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting . analysts and competitors said_0 the move reflects a growing need by the stores to_expand their customer_base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who pops into a convenience store for a sandwich , cigarettes , soda or beer . `` there_are an increasing number_of people out there who are time-poor , '' said chris vroom , retail analyst_with alex . brown_& sons of baltimore . `` those are primarily white-collar workers , a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores . '' national_convenience 's move is_likely to be echoed by other chains , though analysts note that southland corp. , owner of 7-eleven stores , and circle k corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort . still , southland said that its franchisees have_been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years , and that the company has_begun to follow_suit . for_instance , southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets . several_months ago , it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores , a spokeswoman_said 0 . ``_we certainly see an increasing trend_toward that , '' she_added . national_convenience said_0 it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores , with favorable results . analysts said_0 the company 's effort will_be helped by its decision last_year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores , allowing national_convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't . to_promote its new strategy , national_convenience said_0 it plans to spend about $ 12 million on advertising for the year_ending june_30 , up from about $ 10 million in fiscal_1989 .
