the white_house has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation_'s food supply . the proposed_changes , which are scheduled to be announced today , would_apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods , according_to federal officials . environmental_groups have_been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part_of the proposal . but they_are already objecting to , among_other things , a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides . `` it 's a tremendous disappointment , '' said janet hathaway , an_attorney with the natural_resources defense_council . `` allowing the epa to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community . '' the bush_administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional_leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them . the principles would_give the environmental_protection agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly . there already are proposals pending in congress to overhaul pesticide law . moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this_year 's alar scare , when the epa was harshly criticized for failing_to yank the possible carcinogen , a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier . the agency has since acted to remove alar from the nation_'s grocery shelves by may 31 , 1991 , and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical . in_addition , the principles attempt_to eliminate the so-called delaney paradox . under the delaney clause , which applies to processed food , a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals . under other laws applying to pesticide use , however , that same chemical could_be allowed to be_used on fresh food if it fell within the epa 's tolerance level . among_other changes , the white_house wants to : -- give the epa more flexibility 0 to declare a pesticide an_imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace . -- speed_up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an_imminent hazard . -- bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal_government has set a standard . -- give the epa added discretion 0 to set `` negligible risk '' levels for pesticide residues in processed food . chemicals that exceed these risk levels would_be barred , but those that fall_below these levels would_be allowed . -- allow the epa to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost .
