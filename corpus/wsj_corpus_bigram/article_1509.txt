as georgia-pacific 's bid for great_northern nekoosa has_shown 0 , uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise . therefore , the debate about poison_pills will_continue to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia . although poison_pills come in different colors and shapes , they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically , if a hostile bidder acquires more_than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock . however , these discount purchase rights may generally be_redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if_they approve of a bidder . supporters of poison_pills argue_that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation 's directors , who are thereby put in a better position 0 to_pursue the long-term interests of the corporation . recent studies by georgeson &_co. conclude that corporations with poison_pills have experienced greater stock-price appreciation than corporations without poison_pills during the past_few years . critics of poison_pills argue_that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders . these critics are backed_by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison_pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run , but also over longer periods . institutional_investors that must evaluate poison_pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions_about the corporation issuing the pill . does this corporation have a high-quality management_team with a good track_record ? does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period ? will the adoption of this particular form of a poison_pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry_out this strategy ? if the answers to these questions are affirmative , then institutional_investors are_likely to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison_pill . however , the problem is that once most poison_pills are adopted , they survive forever . although the current management_team may_be outstanding , who will_be the ceo in 10_years ? although the five-year strategy may_be excellent , what will_be the strategy in 25 years ? the solution to this problem is a time-limited poison_pill . the limit could range from three_years to seven_years , depending_on the composition of the management_team and the nature of its strategic plan . at the end of this period , the poison_pill would_be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison_pill were approved_by the then-current shareholders , who would_have an_opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management_team at that time . one rare example of a time-limited poison_pill is the shareholder_rights plan adopted by pennzoil last_year after it received a huge litigation settlement from texaco . pennzoil 's poison_pill covers five_years in order to give current management enough time 0 to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner . another interesting example is the poison_pill adopted recently by pittsburgh-based national_intergroup inc. , a diversified holding_company . the state of wisconsin investment board , which owned about 7_% of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to devise a time-limited poison_pill . this pill automatically expires after three_years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders . the attitude of the wisconsin investment board reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison_pills on the part_of institutional_investors , as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the council of institutional_investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions . more widespread time limits_on poison_pills would_allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison_pill within the context of a specific management_team 's strategy . such concrete analysis is_likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison_pills . mr. pozen is the general_counsel and a managing_director of fidelity_investments in boston .
