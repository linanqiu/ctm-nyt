the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission sued new_york state for age discrimination against appointed state judges . the suit , filed in federal_court in manhattan , charges that new_york 's mandatory retirement_age of 76 violates federal law . separately , the commission intervened in a connecticut state judge 's age-bias suit in federal_court in new_haven . the commission 's filing in that case challenges connecticut 's mandatory retirement_age of 70 for appointed judges . the new_york suit was filed on_behalf of justice isaac rubin , whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end , and all other judges hurt_by the alleged age discrimination . the suit , assigned to federal_judge kimba wood , seeks a permanent injunction , back pay for judges who have_been forced to retire , reinstatement of retired judges and `` other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of -lrb- new_york 's -rrb- unlawful employment practices . '' justice rubin , a state judge since 1969 , said_0 the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench . `` the issue is n't age -- age is just a number . the issue is one of a judge 's experience , his competence and his physical ability_to serve on the bench , '' justice rubin said . ``_i 've_had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities . '' because justice rubin turned 76 on may 9 , he is n't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year . the suit 's impact_on new_york may_be narrow , however . most new_york judges are elected , and the federal age-discrimination law does_n't apply to elected officials , said_0 james l. lee , regional attorney for the eeoc in new_york . under new_york law , elected judges must retire at age 70 , but then can_be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76 . a spokeswoman for the state 's office of court administration declined to comment_on the suit . but she said_0 the state currently has 35 appointed judges who are over 70 . in connecticut , however , most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved_by the state legislature . the parties in the connecticut case have agreed_to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another eeoc age-bias case against vermont . in the vermont case , a federal_judge ruled_that the state 's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal ; vermont 's appeal of that decision is pending before the u.s. second circuit_court of appeals in manhattan . aaron ment , connecticut 's chief court administrator , declined to comment_on the suit and the eeoc 's intervention . he said_0 the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 `` trial referees , '' who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench . organized_crime strike forces likely_to be abolished next_month . u.s._attorney general dick thornburgh 's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is_expected to go_into effect next_month , despite the opposition of democratic congressional_leaders and lawyers in the special units . the units are autonomous from u.s._attorneys ' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases . in february , mr._thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units . he_says 0 the strike-force lawyers will work more_efficiently under the supervision of u.s._attorneys . mr._thornburgh will_be free to disband the strike forces after congress approves a $ 479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies , according_to david runkel , a justice_department spokesman . the bill is_expected to pass in congress next_month . congress temporarily halted mr._thornburgh 's effort with an appropriation resolution that prohibited him from using budgeted funds to implement his plan . opponents say_0 mr._thornburgh 's plan will needlessly break up longtime , tightly knit crime-fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime figures . they predict that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to u.s._attorneys ' offices . some former strike-force personnel say_0 the units have already begun to break up . the eastern district unit in brooklyn , n.y. , lost seven of its 15 attorneys this_year partly_because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization , says_0 laura a. brevetti , who left the strike force to join morrison cohen singer & weinstein , a new_york law_firm . `` those_who have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue , '' ms. brevetti says . but mr._runkel contends_0 there has_been no exodus of strike-force lawyers . he_says 0 27 lawyers have left and 21 have_been hired since mr._thornburgh announced his plan . at the time 0 the plan was announced , there_were 135 lawyers . some congressional_leaders intend_to continue to fight for independent strike forces . a spokesman for sen._edward m. kennedy_-lrb- d. , mass . -rrb- says_0 mr._thornburgh would_be required to reinstate the units next_year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed . among_other things , the bill calls_for a reorganization of the justice_department . the senate is_expected to consider the bill shortly , says_0 the senator 's spokesman . mr._runkel says_0 he doubts 0 mr. kennedy can muster enough congressional support to reorganize the justice_department . ``_we will vigorously oppose the bill , '' he_says . ``_i do_n't think_0 -lrb- the reorganization is -rrb- going_to happen . '' whitman & ransom recruits lawyers from disbanding firm : the 204-lawyer new_york firm will bring in at_least 12 partners and a not_yet determined number_of associates from golenbock & barell , which will dissolve dec._31 . golenbock , with 35 lawyers , has lost several partners during the past year . some golenbock lawyers wo_n't be invited to join whitman & ransom , according_to partners at both firms . whitman & ransom managing_partner maged f. riad said_0 the golenbock recruits will enhance the firm 's corporate and litigation departments . short skirts not welcome in texas court : shelly hancock , a male county court judge in houston , refused_to let a woman plead_guilty to a drunk-driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees . the woman appeared in court thursday to enter her plea , but when she started to approach the bench , she was stopped by judge hancock . he told the woman 's lawyer , victor blaine , that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance . despite mr. blaine 's protests , the judge rescheduled her case for nov._27 . kelly siegler , an assistant district attorney who was in the courtroom , disputed suggestions 0 the action was sexist , saying_0 she had seen judge hancock turn away male defendants dressed in shorts , tank tops or muscle shirts `` many times .
