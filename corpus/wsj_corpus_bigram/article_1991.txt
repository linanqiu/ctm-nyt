contrary to what might_be expected based_on the headline on john_r. dorfman 's recent money matters article -lrb- `` pros hit theorists right where it hurts '' oct. 3 -rrb- , i was able_to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent_with what they have_been taught in the classroom . in particular , i_do not find the fact_that your group of pros ' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency . mr. dorfman states that an_investor who invested $_100,000 a year_ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one_month later , purchasing the four new pro picks , and repeated this process for the year would_have accumulated $ 166,537 , excluding account dividends , taxes and commissions . in contrast , an_investor holding the dow_jones portfolio over the year would_have accumulated only $ 127,446 . accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation . accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments . thus , rather_than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal , i see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk . i_believe 0 the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large . if_you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return , i would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk , as i_am sure_0 your pros do . your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk . moreover , your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains 0 to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio . a four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great_deal of unnecessary risk . this means 0 the returns can vary a great_deal . mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would_have accumulated only $ 112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks 0 to be held in a portfolio each month . scott e. hein texas tech university lubbock , texas your investment dartboard article misses the target . the fact_that stock_pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12_months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory . what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend_to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio . for_example , your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are , on average , 22.5 % riskier than holding the market portfolio according_to value line 's beta estimates . james morgan 's pick for october -- dynascan -- is a substantial 35_% riskier than the market portfolio ; his lauded thermo electron pick is 40_% riskier . eric c. meltzer
