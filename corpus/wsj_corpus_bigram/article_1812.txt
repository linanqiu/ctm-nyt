'' they added that `` all of us -lrb- cocom members -rrb- look_at the changes in hungary and poland in a positive way , but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study . '' the officials also said_0 the meeting agreed_to continue treating china as a special case , despite the recent repression of dissent there , but to offer no further concessions . the u.s. officials said that despite the rapid changes under_way in eastern_europe and the soviet_union , all the cocom members agreed on `` the continuing need for this organization , '' which was founded 40 years_ago at the start of the cold war . the officials said_0 the meeting agreed_to continue working toward `` streamlining '' cocom 's restricted products list , and to improve procedures for punishing companies that do_n't comply_with the export restrictions . the officials said_0 this meeting `` put in motion '' procedural steps that would speed_up both of these functions , but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter .
