merksamer_jewelers inc. , a fast-growing jewelry store_chain , filed for chapter_11 bankruptcy-law_protection from creditors , apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain . the filing , made yesterday in u.s._bankruptcy court here , follows an_agreement by l.j._hooker corp. , merksamer 's owner , to sell the chain to management for an_undisclosed price . ge_capital corp. , a financial_services subsidiary of general_electric co. , is providing merksamer management with $ 15 million in financing . l.j._hooker , based in atlanta , filed for chapter_11 protection in_august and has also announced its intention to sell its b._altman &_co. department_store chain . l.j._hooker is owned_by hooker_corp. , sydney , australia , which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . l.j._hooker 's planned sale of merksamer is_subject to approval by judge tina brozman of u.s._bankruptcy court . rumors to the effect that the merksamer chain would file for chapter_11 arose last_week in the jewelry industry . at that time , sam merksamer , president of the chain , angrily denied that his company was about to file . mr. merksamer is leading the buy-out . according_to executives close to the situation , merksamer filed for chapter_11 to speed the sale of the chain . one executive said_0 an accord signed by the unsecured_creditors of l.j._hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j._hooker 's assets . the merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement . `` by filing for chapter_11 , the merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale , not the hundreds_of unsecured_creditors , '' said this executive . `` the cash from the sale will_go to l.j._hooker , but the company itself will belong to sam merksamer . '' mr. merksamer and sanford sigoloff , chief_executive of l.j._hooker , were_unavailable for comment . in a statement , mr. merksamer described the filing as a `` legal technicality , '' but also said that `` our inability to_obtain trade credit , combined_with a need to ensure_that our stores were properly stocked for the christmas_season , necessitated our filing chapter_11 . '' the jewelry chain , which is based in sacramento , calif. , had revenue of $ 62 million and operating_profit of $_2.5 million for the year_ended june_30 .
