the house voted to boost the federal minimum_wage for the first_time since early 1981 , casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed_by president_bush . the vote came_after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor . advocates said_0 the 90-cent-an-hour rise , to $_4.25 an_hour by april_1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued_that the increase will still hurt small_business and cost many thousands_of jobs . but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed_to on tuesday by president_bush and democratic_leaders in congress , after congressional republicans urged the white_house to bend a_bit from its previous resistance to compromise . so both_sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum_wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $_3.35 an_hour from $ 2.65 . under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum_wage would rise to $ 3.80 next april . the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is_expected to pass it . `` there_are no smiles about this bill , '' rep. pat williams -lrb-_d. , mont . -rrb- said during house floor debate yesterday . but `` because it 's all 0 we_'ve got , i_'m going_to vote for it . '' while the minimum_wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage , the level of $_4.25 an_hour in 1991 will still be less_than 35_% of average factory pay , mr. williams said_0 . but rep. marge roukema -lrb-_r. , n.j . -rrb- instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that gop administrations have sought for many years . adopting a training-wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum_wage , '' mrs. roukema said_0 . policy_makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an_increase in the minimum_wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work_force . labor unions and democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of bush_administration insistence . the compromise sets the training_wage at $_3.35 an_hour next april , and at $ 3.61 an_hour , or 85_% of the minimum_wage , in april_1991 . employers can pay the subminimum for 90_days , without restriction , to workers with less_than six_months of job experience , and for another 90_days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers . the training_wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years_old . the white_house previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training_wage that could_be paid any time 0 a worker of any age took a new job . the u.s. chamber of commerce , still opposed to any mininum-wage increase , said_0 the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27_% in two stages between april 1990 and april_1991 `` will_be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher_prices for american consumers .
