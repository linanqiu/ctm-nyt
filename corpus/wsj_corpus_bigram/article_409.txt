bullish bond_market sentiment is on the rise again . as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money_managers is that the news will_be negative . and that , they say , will_be good for bonds . `` recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic_activity , '' said elliott platt , director of economic research at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette_securities . mr. platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond_prices is_likely to remain upward . '' analysts insist_that even without help from a shaky stock_market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the oct._13 stock_market plunge , bond_prices will start to climb on the prospects that the federal_reserve will_allow interest_rates to move lower in the coming_weeks . that would_be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third_quarter by incorrectly assuming that the fed would ease . investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation_that interest_rates would_continue to fall . but when it became_clear that rates had stabilized and that the fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled . long-term bonds have performed erratically this_year . for_example , a group of long-term_treasury bonds tracked_by merrill_lynch &_co. produced a total_return of 1 % in the first_quarter , 12.45 % in the second_quarter and -0.06 % in the third_quarter . total_return is price changes plus interest_income . now some investment analysts insist_that the economic climate has_turned cold and gloomy , and they_are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins . among_other things , economists note that consumer_spending is slowing , corporate profit_margins are_being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed . at the same_time , last_week 's consumer_price index showed that inflation is moderating . add it all up and it means `` that the fed has a little leeway 0 to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said_0 norman robertson , chief_economist at mellon bank corp. , pittsburgh . ``_i think_0 we will see a federal_funds rate of close to 8_1\/2 % in the next two_weeks and 8_% by year end . '' the federal_funds rate , which banks charge each_other on overnight_loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the fed 's credit policy . economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the fed from around 9_% , where it had_been since_july , to about 8_3\/4 % in early_october on the heels of a weak employment_report . although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock_market sell-off that occurred oct._13 , it ended friday at about 8_11\/16 % . james kochan , chief fixed-income strategist_at merrill_lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he_says 0 should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest_rates fall . `` given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said . mr. kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade_corporate bonds and long-term treasurys . he_says 0 these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield_junk bond markets , seek safer securities . `` if the -lcb- tennessee_valley authority -rcb- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand_for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said . tva , in its first public debt offering in 15_years , sold $_4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last_week . strong investor_demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $_3 billion . tva , which_operates one of the nation_'s largest electric_power systems , is a corporation owned_by the federal_government . but persuading investors to buy bonds may_be especially tough this_week , when the u.s. government will auction more_than $ 30 billion of new securities . today , the treasury_department will sell $_15.6 billion of three-month and six-month_bills at the regular weekly auction . tomorrow , the treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year_notes . resolution_funding corp. , known_as refcorp , a division of a new government agency_created to bail_out the nation_'s troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction wednesday , when it will sell $_4.5 billion of 30-year_bonds . all of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in november . so_far , investors have n't shown much appetite_for refcorp 's initial bond_offering . roger early , a portfolio_manager at federated investors corp. , said that yields_on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention . `` why_should i bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said . ``_i 'm_not going_to jump on them the first day 0 they come_out . '' he seems to be typical of many professional money_managers . when the size of the refcorp offering was announced last_week and when-issued_trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about 1\/20 percentage_point more_than the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond . on friday , the yield was_quoted at about 1\/4 percentage_point higher_than the benchmark bond , an_indication of weak demand . some_economists believe_that yields_on all treasury_securities may rise this_week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply . but once the new securities are digested , they_expect investors to focus_on the weak economic_data . `` the supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said samuel kahan , chief_financial economist_at kleinwort_benson government securities_inc . `` if one thinks that rates are going down , you_do n't care how_much supply is coming . '' friday_'s market_activity most bond_prices fell on concerns_about this_week 's new supply and disappointment that stock_prices did_n't stage a sharp_decline . junk_bond prices moved higher , however . in early_trading , treasury_bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese_investors would_continue . also providing support to treasurys was hope that the stock_market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index_futures and options on indexes and individual_stocks . those hopes were dashed when the stock_market put in a relatively quiet performance . treasury_bonds ended with losses of as_much as 1\/4_point , or about $_2.50 for each $_1,000 face_amount . the benchmark_30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 1\/4 during the day , ended at_101 17\/32 . the yield on the benchmark bond rose_slightly to 7.98_% from 7.96_% . in the corporate bond_market , traders_said 0 the new-issue market for junk_bonds is_likely to pick_up following chicago &_north western acquisition corp. 's $_475 million junk_bond offering friday . today , for_example , underwriters at morgan_stanley &_co. said_0 they_expect to price a $_150 million , 12-year senior_subordinated debenture offering by imo_industries inc . traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12_% . shearson_lehman hutton_inc. said that a $_150 million senior_subordinated discount debenture issue by r.p. scherer drugs is_expected by the end of the month . however , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk_bond investors and analysts are_skeptical 0 the deals will get done . `` there_are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said michael mcnamara , director of fixed-income research at kemper_financial services_inc . `` if_they had this much trouble with chicago &_north western , they_are going_to have an awful time with the rest . '' last_week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk_bond deals because of recent weakness in the market . and pressure by big investors forced donaldson_lufkin &_jenrette securities corp. to sweeten chicago &_north western 's $_475 million junk_bond offering . after hours of negotiating that stretched late into thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior_subordinated debentures at_par to yield 14.75 % , higher_than the 14.5 % that had_been expected . the coupon on the issue will_be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market_value of 101 . however , the maximum coupon_rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % . debenture_holders also will_receive the equivalent of 10_% of the common_stock in chicago &_north western 's parent_company . `` the coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , '' said a spokesman for donaldson . ``_we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' the spokesman_said 0 the issue was sold out and met_with strong interest abroad , particularly from japanese_investors . in the secondary , or resale , market , junk_bonds closed 1\/2_point higher , while investment-grade_corporate bonds fell 1\/8 to 1\/4_point .
