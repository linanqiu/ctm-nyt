the bad_news in the junk_bond market yesterday was that tw services , a group of restaurant chains , became the latest prospective issuer 0 to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers . the good_news -- to fans of stable credit , at_least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers . apparently they_are learning to say no to excess risk . coniston_partners , which with related entities controls 80_% of tw , had_been planning to sell $_1.15 billion of junk_bonds , among_other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares . but coniston , a new_york partnership managed by the firm of gollust , tierney & oliver , yesterday announced that `` in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets '' the offering would_be postponed and restructured . what was n't mentioned is that coniston and its investment_banker , donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette , just completed a two-week `` road show '' for the purpose of marketing the bonds . and investors , at_least for now , took a pass . tw 's junk_bonds were n't , as junk_bonds go , unusually weak . its fast-food_restaurants --_including denny 's , hardee 's , quincy 's and el pollo loco -lrb- `` the only significant fast-food_chain 0 to specialize in char-broiled chicken '' -rrb- -- are stable , recession-resistant and growing . but unless_they continued to grow , tw , based in paramus , n.j. , would_have run_into trouble . until_recently , such buy-now , pray-for-growth-later deals were routine . `` but people do_n't buy anything on expectation anymore , ''_says jack utter , who_manages the high-yield fund of ids financial_services . `` investors , '' he_adds , `` are getting religion . '' the tw buy-out may yet be financed . `` there_is nothing wrong with the company , ''_says coniston principal paul tierney . the rub , he_says 0 , is that `` the junk_market is n't as deep '' as before . tw 's stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov._21 . by then , dlj hopes to be_able to sell less-junky junk_bonds . gollust , tierney & oliver is_likely to contribute more_than the $ 120_million in equity 0 it had planned on . banks may contribute more senior debt . and the total amount of junk financing will_be reduced . a dlj banker , putting a best_possible face on it , asserts that `` very few people said_0 they_did n't like the credit quality . people said_0 they_did n't_think 0 a billion-dollar deal would trade . '' but trading risk stems_from credit risk . and by adding equity , dlj would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern . indeed , the dlj banker says_0 , in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest `` will meaningfully improve . '' as he sums it up : ``_we are listening to the market . '' what is it , to borrow a term from coniston , that so unsettled the market ? some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens_of previous junk offerings . the tw prospectus says that if the acquisition had_been completed earlier , pretax earnings `` would_have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges , including interest on debt_securities , '' by approximately_$ 62.7 million in the first_six months of 1989 . tw notes , as many junk issuers do , that `` adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges '' tw would_have run a cash surplus -- in this case , of $ 56 million over six_months . but such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation , taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers , deterioration of stores and the like . in fact , dlj says_0 , the company envisions capital expenses of about $ 180_million a year . tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have_risen steadily and that people wo_n't stop eating during a downturn . but they wo_n't necessarily eat at denny 's . the fast-food business is `` intensely competitive , '' notes 0 wertheim_schroder analyst john rohs . prospective bond buyers noted_that tw historically has prospered because it has_been willing_to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus . ``_we were concerned that they_were n't going_to generate enough cash for capital_spending and also 0 to pay down debt , ''_says a big investor in high-yield debt . dlj argues_that tw could , if_necessary , cut capital_spending , since half of what it plans to spend is for `` growth , '' rather_than maintenance . but investors noted_that under the shelved offering , tw would_have needed to grow to meet its debt payments . its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ 52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred , or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would_have had to be_paid . the prospectus notes 0 `` there can_be no assurance '' that future growth will_continue at past levels . in the recent past , bond buyers did_n't seek such assurance . now , apparently , they do . tw services -lrb- nyse ; symbol : tw -rrb- business : restaurants year_ended dec._31 , 1988 \* revenue : $ 3.57 billion net_income : $ 66.9 million ; $_1.36 a_share \*\* third_quarter , sept._30 , 1989 : -lrb- net_loss :_7 cents share -rrb- vs. net_income : 51 cents_a share average_daily trading_volume : 179,032 shares common_shares outstanding : 49 million \* includes results of denny 's inc. , acquired in_september \*\* includes $ 9 million write-down of assets and takeover defense costs .
