housing construction sank in_september to its lowest_level since the last recession , the commerce_department reported 0 . work began on homes and apartments at an annual_rate of 1,263,000 units last_month , down 5.2_% from august , the department said_0 . the september decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2_% in_august and left housing_starts at their weakest since october 1982 , when the country was nearing the end of a recession . originally the department had reported the august decline as 5_% . the numbers suggest_that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the federal_reserve 's battle against inflation . the industry had shown signs of recovery this_summer , after the central_bank began to relax its clamp on credit , allowing interest_rates to drop a_bit after pushing them up for a year . sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses , which had_been climbing , dropped . but last_month new construction in all types_of homes waned , from single-family houses to large apartment complexes . `` it 's pretty_much weak across the board , '' said martin regalia , chief_economist of the national council of savings institutions . mr. regalia said_0 the industry may_be reluctant_to step_up building at the moment for fear 0 the inventories of unsold homes will increase again . another_reason for the weakness , he said_0 , may_be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in march . in_august , rates on_30-year fixed-rate_mortgages started creeping up a_bit , but they inched down again through september . `` rates have n't really peeled off that much , '' mr. regalia said . ``_we 've kind_of settled now into an interest-rate environment that 's fairly high . '' work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual_rate of 971,000 in_september , a drop of 2.1 % from the previous_month . that followed a 3.3_% decline in_august . construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2 % to an annual_rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5_% decline in_august . the number_of building_permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4_% to a 1,296,000 annual_rate after rising 3.7_% in_august . all the numbers were adjusted_for normal seasonal variations in building activity . the housing_starts numbers , however , are one of the least precise of the government 's economic_indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected .
