stock of united_airlines parent_ual corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation_that one or more investors may challenge the ual_board 's decision to remain_independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction . the board 's decision , announced after the market closed monday , initially prompted a severe sell-off in ual shares , which at midday traded as low as $_145 a_share , down $ 33 a_share , in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . the deepening bloodbath for takeover-stock_traders , who by then had seen ual_stock tumble 49_% since oct._12 , also triggered a marketwide sell-off that sent the dow_jones industrial_average down more_than 80_points at 10:40 a.m . but then steady , concentrated buying by bear , stearns_& co. , which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders , took hold and steadied the fall in ual , which eventually buoyed the entire market . the industrial_average closed_down only 3.69 points at 2659.22 . late in the afternoon , several big purchases by bear , stearns , particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $_150 a_share , triggered a buying spree that took ual up more_than 18 points in the final hour of trading . ual_stock closed_at $_170 a_share , down $ 8.375 . volume_was a tumultuous 4.9_million shares , or 22_% of the 21.8 million ual shares_outstanding . traders estimated that bear , stearns bought more_than 1 million_shares . the two most frequently rumored buyers , neither of whom would comment , were coniston_partners , which battled the ual_board in 1987 , and new_york real_estate developer_donald trump , who recently made and withdrew an offer for american_airlines parent amr corp . however , one_person familiar_with ual said_0 the signs pointed to coniston because mr._trump has n't asked for permission to buy more_than $ 15 million of stock under federal_antitrust rules . takeover-stock_traders , stung by their huge_losses in ual_stock , remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse oct._13 of a $_300-a-share , $_6.79 billion labor-management_buy-out . their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents . baker , nye investments , a new_york takeover-stock trader that owns ual_stock , would n't_comment on reports 0 the firm is_considering seeking such a shareholder vote . but partner richard nye said , `` this is the most extraordinary failed transaction 0 i_'ve seen in 25 years in this business . it would make_sense for somebody to do it . i have never_seen a case of incompetence shared by so_many participants . '' in 1986 , baker , nye waged a proxy fight for control of leaseway transportation inc. that ultimately led to leaseway 's being_sold . some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by ual 's investment_adviser , first_boston corp. , that recapitalizations could yield $ 245 to $_280 a_share . but those would_require pilots_' cooperation . any investor who acquires ual_stock in an_attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal_with united 's contentious unions . the pilots are working under an expired contract , and the machinists contract expires next_month . that gives_them enormous leverage , including the threat of a strike 0 to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt 0 they oppose . however , a catalyst like coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management_group at the last price discussed by that group before the board_meeting monday . the pilots had_been working on a buy-out_bid between $_225 and $_240 a_share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . one_person familiar_with ual said_0 the unsettled labor_situation and the uncertain world-wide financial_markets contributed_to the board 's decision to_avoid `` rushing around selling the company at a bargain price , '' particularly since it accepted a $_300-a-share offer just last_month . even some takeover-stock_traders said_0 they could_n't quarrel with the board 's logic . but the board 's decision prompted many to bail_out of the stock yesterday . ``_we had a_lot of people_who threw in the towel today , '' said earl ellis , a partner in benjamin jacobson &_sons , a specialist in trading ual_stock on the big_board . another trader noted_that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual_stock at the bottom , but already_own so_much 0 they ca_n't buy any more . `` this deal is like a roach motel , '' he said . `` they check in , but they ca_n't check out . '' but both the traders and the pilots remain interested_in some transaction . so too , according_to many reports , is british_airways plc , despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out . the pilots might end_up teaming up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists_union , in a recapitalization . the machinists are reviewing proposals 0 they made in the past for recapitalizations that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority_stake . the company rejected those past proposals . it is unclear , however , if the machinists would support a majority_stake , as the pilots want . a machinist official said_0 that would depend_on how_much in concessions machinists would_have to give in return for the majority_stake . some investors whose names were bandied about by traders as potential ual_stock buyers said_0 they_were n't buying . ``_i 'm_not interested , '' said dallas investor_harold simmons . a source close to carl_icahn , a corporate raider who owns trans_world airlines inc. , said_0 he has n't owned any ual_stock and is n't buying . one_person familiar_with texas billionaire robert_bass said_0 he is n't likely_to make any hostile moves . and a spokesman for reliance group holdings_inc. , which had held 7_% of ual before the first buy-out_bid but later reduced its holdings below 5_% , would n't_comment . marvin_davis , whose $ 5.4_billion takeover_bid originally put the nation_'s second-largest airline in play , is limited by a standstill_agreement with ual 0 he signed in_september . the los_angeles investor ca_n't buy ual_stock , solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $_300 a_share or ual accepts an offer below $_300 . however , mr._davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price .
