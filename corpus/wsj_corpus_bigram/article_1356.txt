centrust savings_bank said_0 federal thrift_regulators ordered it to suspend dividend_payments on its two classes of preferred_stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns_about the troubled institution have heightened . in a statement , miami-based centrust said_0 the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends . regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred_stock . david l. paul , chairman and chief_executive officer , criticized the federal office of thrift_supervision , which issued the directive , saying_0 it was `` inappropriate '' and based_on `` insufficient '' reasons . he said_0 the thrift will try_to get regulators to reverse the decision . the suspension of a preferred_stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns_about an institution 's health . in march , regulators labeled centrust a `` troubled institution , '' largely_because of its big junk-bond_holdings and its operating losses . in the same month , the office of thrift_supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common_stock dividends until its operations were on track . for the nine_months ended_june 30 , centrust had a net_loss of $ 21.3 million , compared_with year-earlier_net income of $ 52.8 million . centrust , which is florida 's_largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation . since_april , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ 890 million from $_1.35 billion . mr._paul said_0 only about $_150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the securities and exchange_commission . the remainder , he said_0 , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the sec and do_n't have a ready market . centrust and regulators have_been in a dispute_over market valuations for the junk_bonds . the office of thrift_supervision has_been hounding centrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but centrust has said_0 it ca_n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack_of a ready market . regulators have become increasingly antsy about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond_holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout_legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond_market . the legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk_bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate . in american_stock exchange_composite trading_friday , centrust common_shares closed_at $_3 , down_12.5 cents . in a statement friday , mr._paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying_0 the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have_been substantially offset_by gains in other activities of the bank . '' he also said_0 substantial reserves have_been set_aside for possible losses from the junk_bonds . in the third_quarter , for_instance , centrust added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves . mr._paul said_0 the regulators should instead move ahead with approving centrust 's_request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to great_western bank , a unit of great_western financial_corp. based in beverly_hills , calif . the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a high-flying institution that relied heavily_on securities trading for profits , according_to mr._paul . most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in july , long before now . many interpret the delay as an_indication that regulators are_skeptical about the proposal . branches and deposits can_be sold at a premium in the event 0 federal_regulators take_over an institution . centrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying_0 it would bring in $_150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion . it said_0 the sale would_give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2_% of assets , from a negative $ 33_million as of sept._30 , thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards . centrust said_0 the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180_million . critics , however , say_0 the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than_ever on brokered deposits and junk_bonds . mr._paul counters that he intends_to further pare the size of centrust by not renewing more_than $_1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due . the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .
