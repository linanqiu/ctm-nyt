the house approved a short-term spending_bill 0 to_keep the government operating through_nov. 15 and provide $_2.85 billion in emergency funds to_assist in the recovery from hurricane_hugo and the california_earthquake . the 321-99 roll_call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance , but the cost to the treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this_year and next under the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law . by a lopsided 401-18 margin , the chamber rejected an_effort to waive gramm-rudman for purposes of addressing the two_disasters , and budget analysts_estimate 0 the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal_1990 deficit by at_least $ 1.44 billion unless offsetting spending_cuts or new revenues are found by congress . the budget impact will_be greater still in fiscal_1991 , and the issue forced a confrontation between the appropriations_committee leadership and budget_committee chairman leon panetta , whose california district was at the center of the earthquake last_week . going_to the well of the chamber , mr. panetta demanded 0 the costs be fully counted . his prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee_members on whom his state will_be most dependent in the months_ahead . ``_we do not come to this house asking for any handout , '' said the california_democrat . ``_we do not intend_to hide these costs from the american people . '' the $_2.85 billion package incorporates $_500 million for low-interest disaster_loans , $_1 billion in highway construction funds , and $_1.35 billion divided_between general emergency_assistance and a reserve 0 to be available to president_bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two_disasters . the funds are in_addition to $_1.1 billion appropriated last_month to_assist in the recovery from hugo , bringing the total for the two_disasters to nearly $_4 billion in unanticipated spending . because of the vagaries of gramm-rudman , the immediate impact is relatively_small . but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal_1991 . within the appropriations process , the situation is even more_difficult since the costs will_be counted against the share of funds 0 to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget . the underlying_bill approved yesterday is required to_keep the government operating past midnight tonight , and this urgency has contributed_to the speed -- and , critics_say 0 , mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance . the hastily drafted measure could hurt california by requiring it to put_up more matching_funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would_be required . and the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will_be counted against a separate $ 185_million in federal_highway funds 0 it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this_year . also , the high price of san_francisco real_estate puts the state at_odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average . for_example , disaster_loans , which will_go to small_businesses and homeowners , offer credit as low as 4_% in some_cases . but the san_francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $_500,000 from $_100,000 to_assist the hard hit but often wealthy marina_district . the senate is_expected to make some modifications today , but both the white_house and congress appear most anxious to speed final_approval before tonight 's deadline . administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding , and the senate changes are_expected to be largely technical -- dealing_with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total small_business administration loans to $_1.8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected . yesterday 's floor action came as a house-senate_conference approved a nearly $ 8.5 billion fiscal_1990 military_construction bill , representing a 5_% reduction from last_year and making severe cuts from pentagon requests_for installations abroad . an_estimated $ 25.8 million is allocated to continue work in oman . but all funding is cut for the philippines , and projects in south_korea are cut to $ 13.6 million , or less_than a sixth of the administration 's_request . closer to home , the negotiators were more generous . an_estimated $ 38.9 million was set_aside for military installations in the home state of north_carolina rep. w.g. hefner , the house chairman . and $ 70.2 million would go to projects in tennessee represented by his senate counterpart and fellow democrat , sen. james sasser . texas and california are traditionally powerful within the conference , but equally striking is the dominance of alaska , pennsylvania and west_virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process . senate_appropriations committee_chairman robert byrd -lrb-_d. , w.va . -rrb- even added report language listing $ 49.4 million in projects 0 he_wants in the budget next_year . no individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than sen. daniel inouye -lrb-_d. , hawaii -rrb- , who chairs the senate defense subcommittee . in the final trading , the house was insistent on setting aside $_500 million to carry_out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal_1990 . but it gave ground to mr. inouye on a number_of projects , ranging_from a $ 11 million parking garage here , to a land transfer in hawaii , to a provision to_assist the makwah indian tribe in washington state . the tribe is one of the poorest in the pacific northwest . mr. inouye , who chairs the select committee on indian affairs , used his power to move $_400,000 from the air_force to the bureau of indian affairs to_assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center . meanwhile , house-senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $_3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative , cutting other federal spending 0.43 % to pay for it . a formal house-senate_conference is_expected to ratify the accord later_this week .
