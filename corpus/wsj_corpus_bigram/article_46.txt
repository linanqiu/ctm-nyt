the voting_rights act of 1965 was enacted to_keep the promise of the fifteenth amendment and enable southern blacks to go to the polls , unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices . twenty-five years_later , the voting_rights act has_been transformed by the courts and the justice_department into a program of racial_gerrymandering designed to increase the number_of blacks and other minorities -- hispanics , asians and native americans -- holding elective office . in the 1980s , the justice_department and lower federal courts that enforce the voting_rights act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number_of `` safe '' minority election districts -- districts where minorities form between 65_% and 80_% of the voting population . the program has even been called upon to create `` safe '' white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority . although section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices , few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the justice_department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless_they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible . the new goal of the voting_rights act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable . for the political process to work , all citizens , regardless of race , must feel represented . one essential indicator that they_are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency . as is , blacks constitute 12_% of the population , but fewer_than 2_% of elected leaders . but racial_gerrymandering is not the best_way 0 to accomplish that essential goal . it is a quick fix for a complex problem . far from promoting a commonality of interests among black , white , hispanic and other minority voters , drawing the district lines according_to race suggests_that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most_important trait . such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person , and that only a white politician can govern on_behalf of a white one . examples of the divisive effects of racial_gerrymandering can_be seen in two cities -- new_york and birmingham , ala . when they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue . new_york city : racial_gerrymandering has_been a familiar policy in new_york city since 1970 , when congress first amended the voting_rights act to_expand its reach beyond the southern states . in 1972 , the justice_department required that the electoral map in the borough of brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and hispanic votes , despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of hasidic jews into two different districts . this_year , a commission appointed by the mayor to revise new_york 's system of government completed a new charter , expanding the city_council to 51 from 35 members . sometime in 1991 , as_soon as the 1990 census becomes available , a redistricting panel will redraw the city_council district lines . the charter revision commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the justice_department and the commission 's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership , the new district lines will_be drawn to maximize the number_of solidly minority districts . blacks and hispanics currently make up 38 % of the city 's population and hold only 25_% of the seats on the council . several of the city 's black leaders , including democratic mayoral nominee david_dinkins , have spoken out for racial_gerrymandering 0 to accord blacks and hispanics `` the fullest opportunity for representation . '' in this connection , it is important to note that several members of new_york 's sitting city_council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black , hispanic , and non-hispanic white populations -- carolyn maloney 's 8th district in northern manhattan and the south_bronx and susan alter 's 25th district in brooklyn , for_example . to win their seats on the council , these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all . often they have found that the relevant issue is not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education . birmingham , ala. : the unusual situation in birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities . in birmingham , which is 57 % black , whites are the minority . insisting that they_are protected by the voting_rights act , a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member city_council and create nine electoral districts , including four safe white districts . the white group argued_that whites were not fully and fairly represented , because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to `` black interests '' could win . no federal_court has ruled_that the voting_rights act protects a white minority , but in june the justice_department approved a districting plan for birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts . richard arrington , birmingham 's black mayor , lamented the consequences . `` in the past , people_who had to run for office had to moderate their views because_they could_n't afford to offend blacks or whites , '' he said . `` now you go to districts , you_'re likely_to get candidates whose views are more extreme , white and black , on racial issues . '' two hundred years_ago , critics of the new united_states constitution warned_that the electoral districts for congress were too large and encompassed too_many different economic interests . a small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman , they said_0 . but james madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written , no. 10 of the federalist papers . madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good . large , heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government , said_0 madison , because a representative would_be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none . madison 's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us . as long as we_believe that all americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interests and can live together cooperatively , our political map should reflect our belief . racial_gerrymandering -- creating separate black and white districts -- says that we have discarded that belief in our ability_to live together and govern ourselves as one people . ms. mccaughey is a constitutional scholar at the center for the study of the presidency in new_york .
