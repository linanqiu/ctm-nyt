in east_germany , where humor has long been the only way_0 to express political criticism , they_'re not laughing about their new leader egon_krenz . mr._krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come_up with any good jokes about him . `` you have to have clear feelings about someone before you_can make jokes , ''_says an east_german mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends . `` with krenz , we just do_n't know_what to expect . '' mr._krenz does_n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner 0 many initially thought_0 he was when the 52-year-old politburo member was selected last_week to succeed erich honecker . but he does_n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either . according_to east_germany 's adn news_agency , mr._krenz spoke to soviet_leader mikhail_gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged 0 east_germany could learn from moscow 's glasnost policies . already last_week , mr._krenz started overhauling east_germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news_media . on thursday , a day after he took_office , east_german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk_show in which viewers call in questions 0 for a panel of officials to answer . the regular nightly news program and daily_newspapers are also getting a visible injection of soviet-style glasnost . `` it was quite a shock , ''_says a 43-year-old east_german shopkeeper . `` for the first_time in my_life , i was n't sure whether i was listening to our news or west_german television . '' other changes , including easing restrictions_on travel for east_germans , are_expected . but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east_germans , who have_taken to the streets by the thousands in recent_weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel 0 they_can trust mr._krenz . and that 's a problem . mr._krenz is not_only closely identified with his mentor , mr._honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action_against protesters this_month and for praising china for sending tanks against student demonstrators . ``_i hope 0 he grows with the job , ''_says rainer eppelmann , a protestant pastor in east_berlin . `` the most_important thing is that he have a chance . '' although mr._krenz is dedicated to east_germany 's conservative vein of communism , there_is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . unlike mr._honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , mr._krenz enjoys asking questions . indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of berlin and wander among the workers -- a la gorbachev . he was later shown on television , fielding questions . at one_point , he asked a worker whether he thought_0 east_germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies . the worker 's tart reply : `` it 's more_than just travel . people have a sense 0 the government is ignoring the real problems in our_society . '' the exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to western news agencies . this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting u.s. congressmen this spring . rather_than trying_to `` lecture us , ''_says 0 one congressional aide who_attended the two-hour meeting , mr._krenz `` wanted to listen . '' rep. ronnie flippo -lrb-_d. , ala. -rrb- , one of the members of the delegation , says_0 he was particularly impressed by mr._krenz 's ready admission that east_germany needed to change . `` he 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an_aide to west_german chancellor helmut_kohl . but there 's another side to mr._krenz . born in a baltic town in an area which is now part_of poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus . he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , mr._honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent . barbara donovan , an expert on east_germany at radio_free europe in munich , says_0 mr._krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts 0 he 's a true reformer . even_if he is , she adds 0 , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist_party 's ruling politburo . against this background , the new east_german leader must move_quickly to shore_up his government 's standing . the sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through poland and hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-soviet workers_' uprising in 1953 . `` he does_n't have any honeymoon period , ''_says a western diplomat based in east_berlin . `` but if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . '' the diplomat adds that mr._krenz has several things going for him . the east_german economy is strong compared_with other east_bloc nations . and his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of mr._honecker as an out-of-touch old man . for average east_germans , mr._krenz remains a puzzle . `` either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right_now , ''_says a 30-year-old east_german doctor . `` either_way , i have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' the doctor was among dozens_of people milling through east_berlin 's gethsemane church saturday_morning . the walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated_with the country 's political opposition . ``_i have to come here to read the walls , ''_says the doctor , `` because it 's information 0 i still ca_n't get through the newspapers . '' meanwhile , east_germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news_media to display a muted sense of humor . television last_week carried a new report on east_berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production . east_germans remember a comment a few_years ago by kurt hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no_reason 0 to change your_own . his point was 0 there_is no_reason for east_germany to copy soviet-style changes . `` it 's hard to know whether it was intended_to be funny , ''_says the east_berlin shopkeeper , `` but everyone 0 i_know laughed about it .
