dentsu inc. , the world 's_largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the japanese market , is setting its sights on overseas expansion . last_year , dentsu started hdm , a joint network with u.s. ad_agency young_& rubicam and eurocom of france . a few_months ago , dentsu acquired 69 % of australian agency fortune communication holdings_ltd. for 5.9_million australian_dollars -lrb-_us$ 4.6 million -rrb- . dentsu has u.s. subsidiaries , but they keep low profiles . now , the giant marketing company , which_holds 25_% of japan 's 4.4 trillion_yen -lrb- $ 30.96 billion -rrb- advertising industry , is_considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the u.s. or europe . what is driving dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to_keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the u.s. and europe . `` if we_do n't do_something ... we wo_n't be_able to catch_up with demand , ''_says a dentsu spokesman . `` our president said_0 acquisition is an effective method . '' last_year , dentsu 's foreign business accounted_for less_than 10_% of total billings , but the company is aiming at 20_% in the near_future . so_far , it appears cautious_about taking the big step . for_example , the spokesman says_0 dentsu has_been approached by banks and securities companies a number_of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group saatchi_& saatchi plc . but he said_0 dentsu has n't looked seriously at saatchi . though dentsu says_0 it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth . it is setting_up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad . for the year_ended march_31 , dentsu sales_rose 19_% to $ 8.9 billion from $ 7.5 billion , and net_income jumped 59 % to $ 102 million from $ 64 million . dentsu 's billings last_year were larger than those of young_& rubicam , the world 's_second-largest ad_agency , according_to a survey by the publication advertising age . but success overseas in unfamiliar markets could_be trickier than for other industries such_as manufacturers . on its_own , dentsu 's muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-japanese clients . thus , an acquisition may_prove the necessary course . but japanese agencies are cautious_about expanding abroad because client relationships are different . japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry , a practice `` that would_be unacceptable by traditional western conflict rules , ''_says 0 roy warman , the london chief_executive of saatchi_& saatchi 's communications division . although acquiring a foreign company would expand japanese advertising_agencies ' business to foreign clients , many clients would also be japanese_companies expanding overseas , says_0 the dentsu spokesman . but the different business system would make it hard for dentsu to provide these japanese_companies the same kind_of services 0 they do in japan .
