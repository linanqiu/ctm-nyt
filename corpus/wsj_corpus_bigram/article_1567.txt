technology_stocks woke up , helping the over-the-counter_market rise from its recent doldrums . the nasdaq_composite index surged 4.26 , or about 0.94 % , to 455.63 . it was the market 's_biggest gain since rising more_than 7 points on_oct. 19 . advancing otc_stocks outpaced decliners by 1,120 to 806 . but the move lagged a stronger rise in new_york stock_exchange issues . the big_board 's composite_index was up more_than 1.4 % , and the dow_jones industrial_average jumped 1.6 % . nasdaq 's gain was led_by its biggest industrial stocks . the nasdaq_100 rose 7.08 to 445.23 . the financial index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76 . other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the transportation index , up 7.55 to 475.35 , and the utility index , up 8.68 to 730.37 . national market system volume improved to 94,425,000 shares from 71.7 million monday . many of nasdaq 's_biggest technology_stocks were in the forefront of the rally . microsoft added 2_1\/8 to 81 3\/4 and oracle systems rose_1 1\/2 to 23 1\/4 . intel was up 1_3\/8 to 33 3\/4 . but traders who watch the stocks warned 0 the rise may_be yet_another `` one-day phenomenon . '' technology_stocks bore the brunt of the otc_market 's recent sell-off , and traders_say 0 it 's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has_turned around . but , they caution , conservative investors would do well to sell into the strength . `` they_are always the first 0 to be_sold when people are taking profits , because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks , '' said robin west , director of research for ladenburg thalmann 's lanyi division , which specializes_in emerging_growth stocks . the technology group includes many of the otc_market 's_biggest stocks , which dominate the market-weighted nasdaq_composite index . analysts_say 0 rallies in the group historically have lifted the market , while weakness in the sector often sank unlisted share prices broadly . but increasing volatility in the sector has exhausted investors who try_to follow its dips and swings . the stocks have_been pummeled repeatedly by inventory gluts and disappointing_earnings as the industry matures and slows . some even claim 0 the group has_become a lagging , not leading , indicator . the technology sector of the dow_jones equity market index has_risen only about 6.24 % this_year , while the nasdaq_composite index has gained 18.35 % . while the composite_index lost less_than a third of its year-to-date gains in the market 's recent decline , the technology group 's gains were more_than halved . the otc technology sector is far from a cohesive unit . the group is divided primarily between software , semiconductors and computers . while computer stocks have_taken the biggest hit from the slowdown in the industry , many software and semiconductor stocks have continued to outperform the market . microsoft is up more_than 50_% this_year , while intel is up more_than 40_% . the technology group is also split between large companies and small , with the biggest stocks trading as blue-chip_issues in the institutional marketplace , while the smaller stocks churn on their individual merits or faults , analysts_say . the volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading , according_to hambrecht_& quist 's technology stock indexes . the brokerage_firm tracks technology_stocks with its technology index , which appreciated only 10.59 % in the first_nine months of this_year . but the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group . that index , which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $_200 million or less , gained 17.97 % by sept._30 this_year -- still lagging the s&p_500 , but leading larger technology firms . yesterday , bank stocks lagged behind the overall otc_market . the nasdaq bank index_rose 0.17 to 432.78 . george jennison , who trades bank stocks for shearson_lehman hutton , said_0 the stocks tend_to fall behind because_they are n't traded as_much as many other issues . but , he_added 0 , interest-rate-sensitive stocks in general are stalled . `` the interest-rate sensitives are n't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears_about what the -lrb- federal_reserve -rrb- will do , '' mr. jennison said . he said that investors will scour the october employment_report , due out friday , for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest_rates . on the other_hand , mr. jennison noted_that the recent slide in bank and thrift stocks was at_least halted yesterday . shearson_lehman hutton gave small_investors some welcome news by announcing that it would no_longer handle index-arbitrage-related program_trades for its accounts . shearson , with its in-house order execution system , has handled the bulk of such program_trades in the over-the-counter_market . the trading has_been blamed for much of the market 's recent_volatility . jaguar topped the most-active list , as its american depository receipts climbed_1 3\/4 to 13 5\/8 with more_than 6.6_million adrs traded . britain said_0 it would waive its `` golden_share '' in the luxury_auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to_acquire more_than 15_% of the company . the announcement effectively removes the british_government as an impediment to a takeover of the company , which is being stalked by general_motors and ford . gen-probe was another active takeover_stock . it surged 2_3\/4 to 6 on volume of more_than 1.7_million shares after the company agreed_to be acquired by japan 's chugai pharmaceutical for about $_110 million -- almost double the market price of gen-probe 's stock . priam corp. lost 5\/32 to 3\/32 after filing for protection_from its creditors_under chapter_11 of the federal_bankruptcy code . mci_communications added_1 1\/2 to 43 3\/8 . the company has toted up over $_40 million in contracts in the past_two days . monday , mci announced a $ 27 million multiyear contract with the investment_bank stuart-james . yesterday , it received a $ 15 million , three-year_contract from drexel_burnham lambert . florida_national banks of fla. slid 1_1\/8 to 24 3\/4 . late_monday , the federal_reserve board said_0 it is delaying
