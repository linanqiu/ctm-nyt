john lehman 's editorial-page_article on the pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population -lrb- `` in the pentagon , the undead walk , '' oct._18 -rrb- . the media 's treatment of the defense_department during the vietnam war , the carter administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of lt. col. oliver_north have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there . the resulting haunted house tends_to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be_able to win if called on . perhaps the halloween season is a good time for congress to be looking_at funding for some ghostbusting equipment . mike greece former air_force career officer new_york where does mr. lehman get off castigating gen. george marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives ? ever_since the days of alfred thayer mahan -lrb- u.s. naval officer and naval historian -rrb- and teddy roosevelt the navy has_been the service most favored by washington officialdom . mr. lehman overlooks the fact_that the navy possesses its_own air_force -lrb- the carrier fleet -rrb- and its_own army -lrb- the marines -rrb- , which in turn has its_own air_force . of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should_be resolved in the interest of national_security , but mr. lehman seems to be part_of the problem rather_than part_of the answer . l.h. blum beaumont , texas i agree with mr. lehman 100 % ! is n't this the same guy_who resigned_as navy secretary because he could_n't get his 1,000-ship navy ? i personally do not want to hasten mr. lehman 's demise , but i can see him figuring prominently in his_own article . carl banerian jr . birmingham , mich .
