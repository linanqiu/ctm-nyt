sotheby_'s inc. , the world 's_biggest auction_house , is taking a huge wall street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of john t. dorrance jr. , the campbell_soup co. heir . the financial_services division has guaranteed the dorrance_family that it will_receive a minimum of $_100 million for the collection , regardless of what the bids for the art works total , people close to the transaction say_0 . the collection , which_includes two early picassos , a van gogh , a monet , other paintings , furniture and porcelains , went on sale last_night in the first of six auctions . what sotheby_'s is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment_bank . a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a wall_street firm , which purchases the securities outright , accepting the financial risk of finding buyers . if the investment_bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer , it makes a profit . at the initial sale last_night , for_example -- the sale featuring the impressionists masters -- bids totaled_$ 116 million . that was slightly above sotheby_'s presale estimate of $ 111 million . normally , sotheby_'s would_have earned 20_% of the total in commissions . instead , people_familiar with the transaction said_0 , the auction_house opted to forgo that percentage in order to_obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $_100 million . art dealers_say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price , a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented . diana d. brooks , president of sotheby_'s north_america division , vehemently denies 0 it offered the dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee , calling such reports `` inaccurate . '' buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale , however , appears the statement , `` sotheby_'s has an interest in the property in this catalog . '' explains 0 a sotheby_'s spokeswoman , the statement `` means exactly_what it says . we have some level of financial interest '' in the collection . ``_we do_n't disclose specifics . '' frank mirabello , a lawyer for the dorrance estate with the philadelphia law_firm of morgan , lewis & bockius , declines to comment_on the financial arrangements . sotheby_'s made the $_100 million guarantee to_keep the dorrance collection away_from its archrival , auction_house christie_'s international plc ; christie_'s has handled smaller sales for the dorrance_family over the years . when christie_'s officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the dorrance collection , representatives of the dorrance_family `` told us 0 it was a question of financial considerations , '' said_0 michael findlay , christie_'s head of impressionist and modern paintings . collectors who have made their money on_wall street have become an increasingly important part_of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom , but recently it appears 0 sotheby_'s has_been returning the compliment . in november 1987 , sotheby_'s essentially offered a wall street-style `` bridge_loan '' of about $ 27 million to australian businessman alan_bond to enable him to purchase vincent van gogh 's `` irises '' for $ 53.9 million . it was the highest bid in history for a work of art . but two_weeks ago , sotheby_'s said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid . sotheby_'s is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market , at_least where the best works are concerned , says_0 ralph lerner , an_attorney and author of the book `` art law . '' `` there seems to be a_lot of art for sale , but there 's more competition . the competition gives the seller the ability_to cut a better deal , '' he_says 0 . the dorrance_family will still receive a substantial portion_of the auction proceeds above $_100 million , people_familiar with the transaction said_0 . but it 's likely that sotheby_'s will_take a higher_than usual commission , called an override , on the amount exceeding the guarantee . sotheby_'s has_been aggressively promoting the dorrance sale . at a news_conference last may announcing plans for the auction , sotheby_'s estimated its value in excess of $_100 million . more recently , sotheby_'s has predicted 0 the collection will fetch $_140 million . that 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history . the decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many , since mr. dorrance had served_as chairman of the philadelphia museum of art , and it had_been assumed 0 many of the works would_be donated to the institution . at last_night 's sale , 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by aska international gallery , the art-acquisition unit of aichi financial , a japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5_% of christie_'s . meanwhile , sotheby_'s guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world . `` the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction_house is a disinterested middleman , ''_says new_york art dealer david tunick . while he_adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest , `` it ought not to be hidden in some small print . '' in such situations , he_says , the house `` is going_to put the best light on things . '' for_example , an auction_house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should_be looked_at with `` very open eyes , '' he_says 0 . `` there 's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level , ''_says bruce miller , president of art funding_corp. , an art lender . dealers and auction houses `` know 0 if_they do_n't lay out a half a million for this , another one will ; it 's that competitive . '' in january , two small new_york galleries , the coe kerr gallery and beadleston fine arts , snatched a major art collection owned_by the askin family away_from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $ 25 million . a christie_'s spokeswoman_said that while the auction_house sometimes waives its seller 's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- christie_'s wo_n't offer financial guarantees because `` christie_'s believes_0 its primary role is as an auction_house , and therefore as an agent -lcb- for buyer and seller -rcb- , not as a bank .
