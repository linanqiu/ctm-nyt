we_'re sorry to see nigel_lawson 's departure from the british_government . he is a politician with the courage of true conviction , as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40_% . but in the end his_resignation as chancellor of the exchequer may_be a good_thing , especially if it works as he no_doubt intends -- by forcing prime_minister thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved . the early omens , we admit 0 , scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome . the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline , `` departure reveals thatcher poison . '' british politicians divide into two_groups of chickens , those with their necks cut and those screaming 0 the sky is falling . so_far as we_can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : mr._lawson and sir_alan walters , the counterpoint of the chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned_as personal adviser to mrs._thatcher . the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary_policy and exchange_rates , conservative , free-market economists divide into at_least three incompatible camps . there_are the strict monetarists , who believe_that floating exchange_rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates . there_are the supply-side globalists , who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange_rates . and there_are the twin-deficit keynesians , who predict\/advocate devaluations 0 to balance trade flows . this is a problem not_only for prime_minister thatcher but for president_bush , as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the federal_reserve and the mulford treasury . in the british case , mr._lawson is the closest thing in london to a supply-side globalist . he not_only slashed marginal tax_rates , initially sparking fresh growth in britain , but he wanted to regulate monetary_policy by targeting exchange_rates , indeed joining the european_monetary system . while no_doubt agreeing with mr._lawson on everything_else , sir_alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death . to make matters even more confusing , the earlier u.s. experience made clear that mr._lawson 's tax cuts would_have profound effects on britain_'s international accounts and the value of sterling . they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far_more attractive place 0 to invest , producing sudden capital inflows . by accounting definitions , this had to produce a sudden trade_deficit . as in the u.s. , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand_for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , m-whatever . at this point , the options were : crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as sir_alan surely advised , and forget the soaring pound . to push the pound even lower trying_to cure the trade_deficit , a policy 0 britain has repeatedly proved disastrous . or to supply enough money 0 to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange_rate , as the chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the ems . faced_with a similar situation , paul volcker let the dollar soar , -lrb- though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly 0 monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation -rrb- . but this devastated the u.s. manufacturing_sector , laying the seeds of protectionism . mr._lawson , though not allowed to join the ems , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark . he reaped inflation along_with rapid_growth , no_doubt validating sir_alan 's predictions in the prime_minister 's mind . but more recently , the pound has_been falling with high inflation , which has also seemed almost impervious to the high_interest rates 0 mr._lawson deployed to stop it . so the british experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far_beyond the shores of albion . we had_been soliciting opinions on it long before mr._lawson 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy , john major . to begin with , we should note that in contrast to the u.s. deficit , britain has_been running largish budget surpluses . in pursuit of this mystery , keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply . we should also add mr._lawson 's own explanation , as we understand it . unlike the u.s. , britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages . the wage stickiness , which oecd studies confirm 0 is particularly high in britain , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation . inflation is easier 0 to spark and harder 0 to control . we should also concede_that in the british experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility 0 it lost in the u.s. experience . nearby paul craig roberts , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for sir_alan . perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates , though of course in the event mr._lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one . we recall that mr._roberts not_only chides the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that mr. volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise . somewhere in between there must_be a golden mean , perhaps measured_by m-whatever , but perhaps measured_by purchasing power parity . the globalists tend_to think_0 mr._lawson ran onto technical reefs . in fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial , for_example , and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-dm rate . for that matter , perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency . we sympathize with mrs._thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of west_germany . perhaps the shock would_have been less if_they 'd fixed to another low-tax , deregulated , supply-side economy . alan reynolds of polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus . those_who can shake keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation , indeed , it is the definition of an open_market operation to_expand the money_supply . mr. reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements , high_interest rates are less likely_to curb inflation than to cause recession . we would add that in political terms , mrs._thatcher 's problem was failing_to decide between the chancellor and her adviser . in the end , neither policy was followed , and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery . in particular , `` shadowing '' a currency is anything but fixing ; it is an open announcement that the exchange_rate target has no credibility . all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy . better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience . so mr._lawson had to resign . in the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from sir_alan 's autobiography in the american economist , a 10,000-circulation academic journal . but it was the underlying situation that became intolerable . what mr. major and mrs._thatcher will do now remains to be seen . they confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy , that is to say , stagflation . this can_not be_solved by provoking a further downturn ; reducing the supply of goods does_not solve inflation . our advice is this : immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts , and find some monetary_policy target that balances both supply and demand_for money -lrb- which neither aggregates nor interest_rates can_do -rrb- . this was the version of supply-side economics that , in the late_1970s and early '80s , worked in america and world-wide to solve a far_more serious stagflation than afflicts britain today .
