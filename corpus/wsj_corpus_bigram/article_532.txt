rorer group_inc. will report that third-quarter_profit rose more_than 15_% from a year_earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset_sales , robert cawthorn , chairman , president and chief_executive officer , said_0 . his projection indicates profit in the latest_quarter of more_than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents_a share , compared_with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents_a share , a year_ago . mr. cawthorn said in an_interview that sales will show an_increase from a year_ago of `` somewhat less_than 10_% . '' through the first_six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12_% from the year-earlier_period . growth of 10_% would make sales for the latest_quarter $ 269 million , compared_with $ 244.6 million a year_ago . mr. cawthorn said_0 the profit growth in the latest_quarter was due to the sale of two rorer drugs . asilone , an antacid , was sold to boots plc , london . thrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to jones medical industries_inc. , st._louis . he said_0 rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax_gain on the sales of $ 20 million . as the gain from the sales indicates , operating_profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , mr. cawthorn said_0 . rorer in july had projected lower third-quarter operating_profit but higher profit for all of 1989 . he said_0 the company is still looking_for `` a strong fourth_quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net_income . '' mr. cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating_profit to the stronger_dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated_into dollars ; to accelerated buying of rorer products in the second_quarter because of a then-pending july 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for rorer 's maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the u.s. had slipped in the first_half of 1989 . he said_0 rorer opted to sell asilone and thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide_sales in 1988 . ``_we had underfunded maalox for a year , '' he said_0 , because the company was concentrating_on research and development and promoting other drugs . he said_0 rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on maalox advertising and promotion in the second_half of 1989 than in the year-earlier_period . a `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third_quarter , he said_0 .
