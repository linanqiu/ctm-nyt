part_of a series -rcb- tom panelli had a perfectly good reason for not using the $_300 rowing machine 0 he bought three_years ago . ``_i ate a bad tuna sandwich , got food poisoning and had to have a shot in my shoulder , '' he_says , making it too painful to row . the soreness , he admits 0 , went away about a week after the shot . yet the rowing machine has n't been touched since , even_though he has moved it across the country with him twice . a san_francisco lawyer , mr. panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine , but , he complains , 0 it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring . it 's a horrible machine , actually . i_'m ashamed 0 i own the stupid thing . '' mr. panelli has plenty_of company . nearly three-fourths of the people_who own home exercise equipment do_n't use it as_much as they planned , according_to the wall_street journal 's `` american way of buying '' survey . the roper_organization , which conducted the survey , said_0 almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected . it is n't just exercise gear that is n't getting a good workout . the fitness craze itself has gone soft , the survey_found 0 . fewer people said_0 they_were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , tennis , swimming and aerobics . half of those surveyed said_0 they simply walk these_days for exercise . that 's good_news for marketers of walking shoes . the survey also detected a_bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers . the survey 's findings certainly are n't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships , tennis rackets and home exercise equipment , but people 's good intentions , if not their actions , are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy . for_instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are_expected to rise 8_% to about $ 1.52 billion this_year , according_to the national sporting goods association , which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s . but even that group knows 0 some people do_n't use their machines as_much as they should . `` the first excuse is 0 they do_n't have enough time , ''_says research_director thomas doyle . `` the second is 0 they do_n't have enough discipline . '' with more_than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past_five years , he_adds 0 , `` a_lot of garages , basements and attics must_be populated with them . '' still , the average price of such bikes rose last_year to $_145 . mr. doyle predicts a trend_toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being_sold at higher_prices . electronic gimmicks are key . premark international_inc. , for_example , peddles the m8.7sp electronic cycling simulator , a $_2,000 stationary cycle . on a video screen , riders can see 30 different `` rides , '' including urban , mountain and desert scenes , and check how_many calories are burned a minute . nancy igdaloff , who_works in corporate payments at bank of america in san_francisco , may_be a good prospect for such a gizmo . she 's trying_to sell a $_150 exercise bike 0 she bought about five_years ago for her roommate . but rather_than write_off home fitness equipment , she traded up : ms. igdaloff just paid about $ 900 for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair . ``_i 'm using it a_lot , '' she_says . ``_i spent so_much money that if i look_at it , and i_'m not on it , i_feel guilty . '' the poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say and what they do . a surprising 78 % of people said_0 they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 . this conjures up images of a nation full of trim , muscular folks , and suggests 0 couch potatoes are out of season . of course , that is n't really the case . the discrepancy may_be because asking people about their fitness regime is a_bit like inquiring about their love life . they_'re bound to exaggerate . `` people say_0 they swim , and that may mean_0 they_'ve been to the beach this_year , ''_says krys spain , research specialist for the president 's council on physical fitness and sports . `` it 's hard to know if people are responding truthfully . people are too embarrassed to say_0 they have n't done anything . '' while she applauds the fact_that more americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden , she_says 0 the percentage of americans who do `` real exercise 0 to build the heart '' is only 10_% to 20_% . so_many people fudge on answers about exercise , 0 the president 's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous : it must produce contractions of large muscle groups , must achieve 60_% of maximum aerobic capacity and must_be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20_minutes . one of the council 's goals , set in 1980 , was to see more_than 60_% of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990 . that target has_been revised to 30_% by the year_2000 . but even that goal may_prove optimistic . of 14 activities , the journal_survey found that 12 --_including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are_being done by fewer americans today than eight_years ago . time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline . only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only_slightly . jeanette traverso , a california lawyer , gave_up running three_times a week to play a weekly round of golf , finding it more social and serene . it 's an activity 0 she feels 0 she can_do for life , and by pulling a golf cart , she still gets a good workout . ``_i 'm really wiped_out after walking five hours , '' she_says . most people said_0 they exercise both for health and enjoyment . `` if_you sit_down all the time , you_'ll go stiff , ''_says joyce hagood , a roxboro , n.c. , homemaker who walks several miles a week . `` and it 's relaxing . sometimes , if_you have a headache , you_can go out and walk it right off . '' only about a quarter of the respondents said_0 they exercise to lose weight . slightly_more , like leslie sherren , a law librarian in san_francisco who attends dance aerobics five_times a week , exercise to relieve stress . `` working with lawyers , '' she_says , ``_i need it . '' but fully 90_% of those polled felt 0 they_did n't need to belong to a health club . `` they_'re too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , ''_says joel bryant , a 22-year-old student from pasadena , calif . `` the guys are_being macho , and the girls are walking around in little things . they_'re not there to work out . '' but at_least they show up . nearly_half of those_who joined health clubs said_0 they_did n't use their membership as often as they planned . feeling 0 they should devote more time to their_families or their jobs , many yuppies are skipping their once-sacred workout . even so , the association of quality clubs , a health-club trade_group in boston , says_0 membership revenues will rise about 5_% this_year from last_year 's $_5 billion . a spokeswoman adds , however , that the group is_considering offering `` a behavior-modification course , similar to a smoking-cessation program , 0 to teach people ways_0 to stay with it . '' there_are die-hard bodies , of course . the proprietor of sante west , an aerobics studio in san_francisco 's marina_district , which was hit_hard by the earthquake , says , `` people were going nuts the minute 0 we opened , '' three_days after the quake . `` the emotional aspect is so draining , 0 they needed a good workout . '' perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may_be an endangered american institution . the survey reported 0 the number_of people_who said_0 they bowl regularly has_fallen to just 8_% from 17_% in 1981 . the american bowling congress claims 0 a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes 0 its membership has declined this decade . to find_out why , the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20_years of bowling-related research . three reasons were pinpointed : a preference for watching bowling and other sports on television rather_than actually bowling , dowdy bowling centers , and dissatisfaction with bowling itself . people_who start bowling expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise `` have_been generally disappointed , '' the report said . but not richard cottrell , a san_francisco cab driver who bowls in two weekly leagues . he hit the lanes three_years ago on the advice of his doctor . `` it 's good exercise , '' he_says . ``_i ca_n't do_anything score-wise , but i like meeting the girls . '' he_says 0 bowling helps him shed pounds , though that effort is sometimes thwarted by the fact_that `` when i_'m drinking , i bowl better . '' his tuesday_night team , the leftovers , is in first place .
