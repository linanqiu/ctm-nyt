the democratic-controlled house , by a margin of 51 votes , failed to override president_bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of medicaid abortions for poor_women who are victims of rape and incest . the 231-191 roll_call illustrates the limits of power 0 a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces . it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over mr._bush . democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin , but republicans were equally firm in support of the president , who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at_least three separate fiscal_1990 spending bills . yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills , an_estimated $ 156.7 billion measure funding the departments of labor , education , and health and human_services . to gain more leverage , abortion-rights advocates may_seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next_month . but the stark numbers yesterday -- when 282 votes were needed -- indicate 0 the president is in a commanding position for at_least this_year . `` unless he changes , they lose , '' said a democratic_leadership aide . the action came as congress_sent to the president last_night a stopgap spending_bill 0 to_keep the government operating through_nov. 15 and provide $_2.85 billion in emergency funds 0 to_assist in the recovery from hurricane_hugo and the california_earthquake . by a lopsided 97-1 margin , the senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought_by the influential california delegation and , despite reservations , the house adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll_call . the package is more_than $_1 billion above the recommendations of budget_director richard_darman this_week . but given the political importance of california , the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any senate amendments adding further new appropriations . the $_2.85 billion measure comes on top of $_1.1 billion appropriated after hugo struck the carolinas and caribbean last_month , and these totals do_n't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster_loans . the bill last_night includes $_500 million 0 to help_finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the small_business administration sixfold to $_1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity . in direct cash assistance , $_1 billion is provided in federal_highway construction funds , and $_1.35 billion is divided_between general emergency aid and a reserve 0 to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two_disasters . in the senate , majority whip alan_cranston used his_position to win not_only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the house had permitted in the distribution of highway_funds in the next six_months . the emergency_assistance would n't be_counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway_funds , and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal_aid to repair a toll road , such_as the san francisco-oakland bay_bridge damaged in last_week 's earthquake . the underlying stopgap bill is the second required by congress this_fall and , since the current_fiscal year began oct._1 , only the energy and interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law . the standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and , apart from the health and education measure vetoed by mr._bush , bills funding the district of columbia and the entire u.s. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues . the vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years , and though the democratic_leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion_issue , the debate is increasingly measured in party terms . the 189 democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two_weeks ago and 136 last_year on a similar vote . by_comparison , republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement . only 42 gop members opposed the president 's veto , a marginal increase over the vote two_weeks ago and just 12 more_than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last_year . at a recent white_house meeting , rep. silvio conte -lrb-_r. , mass._-rrb- , the ranking minority member of the house_appropriations committee , argued with his friend mr._bush against a veto , and though mr. conte and minority leader robert michel of illinois stood with the president yesterday , they_are plainly uncomfortable with his_position . `` this is n't a political issue , this is a moral issue , '' said rep. henry hyde -lrb-_r. , ill. -rrb- , the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement . but after years of using the issue for its benefit , the gop finds its candidates on the defensive . new_jersey gubernatorial candidate rep._james florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent , gop rep._james courter , who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent . in an_extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers , rep. robert dornan -lrb-_r. , calif . -rrb- lectured his_fellow roman catholics --_including mr._florio -- for having the `` chutzpah '' 0 to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion . rep. les aucoin was as blunt on_behalf of the abortion-rights movement . `` this may_not make george_bush a one-term president , '' said the oregon liberal , addressing the republican side of the house . `` but if_you support him over rape victims , this may_be your last term . '' separately , the house last_night approved a nearly $ 67_billion compromise spending_bill providing the first construction funds for the administration 's ambitious space_station in fiscal_1990 and incorporating far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal_housing administration would_be increased to $ 124,875 , and the bill gives the department of housing and urban_development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners . by a 325-92 margin , the appropriations_committee leadership beat back an early challenge by house_banking chairman henry gonzalez -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- to the fha provision . and on a closer 250-170 roll_call , lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made by a house-senate_conference earmarking community_development funds for more_than 40 projects backed_by often influential members .
