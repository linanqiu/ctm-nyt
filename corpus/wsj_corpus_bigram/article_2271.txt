the hottest rivalry in the computer_industry intensified sharply yesterday as digital_equipment corp. announced its first line of mainframe_computers , targeting international_business machines_corp. 's_largest market . ibm fired back with new mainframes of its_own , extending the long-dominant 3090 line with a 7_% to 14_% power boost . up to now , the intense_competition between ibm and digital has_been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market , where digital sought to exploit ibm 's weaknesses in networking . but digital 's move into mainframes will target ibm 's home turf , where it has a commanding 70_% share of the market . digital , maynard , mass. , insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from ibm 's . `` this is not your father 's mainframe , '' said allan mcguire , a digital spokesman . `` it 's a whole new generation , '' he said . ibm , which gets about_half its revenue and more_than half its profit from mainframes , also announced upgraded operating_system software that , together with the new hardware , lets customers do so-called batch processing as_much as 60_% faster . batch processing is the high-volume , single-job data_processing that most mainframes typically chug through at night , such_as updating accounts at banks . ibm said_0 the 16 new j and jh models will generally be available immediately , though three wo_n't ship until the third_quarter of next_year . prices on the larger models , which range as high as $ 13 million , generally wo_n't change . small models , whose performance increased as_much as 46_% , will carry higher_prices . upgrades to bigger models also will_be costlier . digital 's vax 9000 mainframes , which it claimed 0 were among the fastest available , were_priced from $_1.2 million to $_3.9 million , sharply_lower than ibm models of comparable power . the first models will ship in the spring , with the largest following in the fall . analysts were disappointed that digital 's new line apparently wo_n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal_year , which begins in july . jay stevens of dean_witter reynolds_inc. said_0 he may cut his earnings_estimate for the current_fiscal year because he had expected at_least some mainframe profit this_year . but he_added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal_1991 at the same_time . after the announcement yesterday , digital shares gained $_1.25 to close_at $ 89.875 in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . ibm shares_closed at $ 103 , down 50_cents , in big_board trading . analysts have predicted strong pent-up demand_for the new line among digital 's customers . large digital buyers say_0 the new vax will let_them stay with digital when they need the power of a mainframe , instead of turning to ibm . ``_i 'm convinced 0 there 's a huge market for this machine , '' said stephen smith of painewebber_inc . digital also plans to compete fiercely with ibm when the giant 's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses . digital , however , does_n't expect to displace ibm mainframes that are already installed at big companies . in_addition to commercial markets , digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market , when it 's packaged with an optional supercharger , known_as a vector processor . digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay minicomputer line is under growing pressure_from smaller personal_computers and workstations that operate on standard operating_systems rather_than on the proprietary systems that older minicomputers use . although digital has staked out a major presence in the booming workstation market , profit_margins in that market are much slimmer than for mainframes . the slow-growing mainframe market also has_shown new signs of life lately . ibm 's mainframe sales have held up better_than expected this_year , with analysts estimating 0 they have_risen 10_% to 12_% . `` demand_for these systems has_been very , very strong , '' said bill grabe , a senior ibm marketing executive . ``_we have a good strong backlog for the fourth_quarter even without '' the systems that were announced yesterday . but the 3090 line is nearly five_years old -- which is getting up there in mainframe years -- and its growth is_expected to slow in 1990 . ibm , armonk , n.y. , said_0 it wanted to bring out the mainframes as_soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year . the fourth_quarter is always ibm 's_biggest by far , with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end . still , steve cohen , an_analyst at soundview financial group_inc. , said , ``_i do_n't see that this will_be sufficient to give ibm a significant kick in the fourth_quarter . '' ibm has already indicated 0 it will have problems in the quarter , partly_because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk_drive and partly_because the strong_dollar will cut significantly the value of ibm 's overseas earnings when translated_into dollars . some_analysts have estimated 0 ibm 's fourth-quarter per-share_earnings will fall 10_% to $ 3.57 a_share from $ 3.97 a_share a year_earlier . in_addition to the new mainframe hardware and software , ibm announced a magnetic-tape system for data_storage that it said_0 occupies half as_much floor space as older systems but can store five_times as_much data on a single cartridge . that should_help ibm address the damage that a resurgent storage technology corp. has inflicted in that market .
