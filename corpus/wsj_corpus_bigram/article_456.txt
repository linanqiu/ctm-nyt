the u.s. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely_to endanger their_lives , government_officials said_0 . the notification policy was part_of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the reagan_administration and the senate_intelligence committee . the existence of the guidelines has_become known since president_bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white_house meeting last monday . officials familiar_with the meeting said_0 mr._bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements 0 the administration contends_0 contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this_month 's futile effort to oust panamanian dictator manuel_noriega . according_to the officials , mr._bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the white_house discussing the guidelines . they said_0 the president conceded 0 the notification requirement did_n't affect his decision to lend only_minor support to this_month 's panama coup effort . no notification was ever considered , officials said_0 , apparently because the u.s. did_n't think_0 the coup plotters intended_to kill mr._noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . what 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is_likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are_being rewritten by the panel and the white_house . the rewriting was launched at a meeting between mr._bush and intelligence_committee leaders oct._12 , a few_days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules . however , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last_night by nbc_news , is already being interpreted on_capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress . it has reopened the bitter wrangling between the white_house and congress over who is responsible_for the failure to oust mr._noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . a statement issued by the office of the committee_chairman , sen. david_boren -lrb-_d. , okla. -rrb- , charged that the disclosure is part_of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup_attempt in panama . the statement added , `` someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government . not_only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust 0 we have all worked to develop . '' sen. boren said , `` it 's time 0 to stop bickering and work_together to develop a clear and appropriate policy 0 to help the country in the future . i_'ve invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . '' republican sen. william cohen of maine , the panel 's vice_chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the white_house who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' sen. boren said_0 the committee could_n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules . but the chairman and other committee_members stressed_that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the white_house by a meddling congress . instead , both congressional and administration_officials agreed 0 , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in panama that were initiated by the administration in july 1988 and stretched into last october . the guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the u.s. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a u.s. role in assassinations . in fact , yesterday the administration and congress were still differing on what had_been agreed_to . one administration official said_0 notification was required even_if the u.s. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely_to endanger a dictator 's life . but a congressional source close to the panel said_0 the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the u.s. . although the notification guideline was n't carried_out in this_month 's coup_attempt , some administration_officials argue_that it may_have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part_of u.s. intelligence and military operatives in panama . one senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said_0 it could make u.s. operatives reluctant_to even listen to coup plans for fear 0 they may get into legal trouble . the issue came to a head last_year , officials recalled 0 , partly_because the reagan_administration had_sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new panama coup efforts . in_addition , both administration and congressional officials said_0 the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred_by a white_house desire to_avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . though the assassination ban is a white_house order that congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . last_week , central_intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would_permit the u.s. more freedom to act in coups . the administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup_attempt by seeking to blame congress for restrictions 0 the white_house said_0 have hampered its freedom of action . however , last_week mr. webster 's two top cia deputies said_0 congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup_attempt in panama . nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with sens. boren and cohen after their oct._12 meeting with the president . the three men agreed_to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may_have hampered u.s. encouragement of coups against anti-american leaders . the new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed . gerald f. seib contributed_to this_article .
