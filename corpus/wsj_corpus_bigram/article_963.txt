hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction_legislation faded as efforts to streamline the house_version in advance of a house-senate_conference broke down . house leaders had_hoped to follow the senate 's lead by getting an_agreement from house committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal_1990 budget_deficit from the house-passed bill before the negotiations_with the senate began . but the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues , ranging_from cutting the capital-gains_tax to child_care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance . `` many members feel 0 there_are important features of the house bill that should_be enacted , '' speaker thomas foley -lrb-_d. , wash . -rrb- said . `` if there_is any support for reducing the bill , it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form . '' now those items will_be discussed in a house-senate_conference , which could begin as_soon as today , with the expectation that they could either be_resolved there or placed into other legislation . `` you_'ve got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if_they can work things out , '' said house_budget committee_chairman leon panetta -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- . `` this is a democratic process -- you_ca n't slam-dunk anything around here . '' white_house budget_director richard_darman has said_0 he would_continue to press to_keep the capital-gains_provision in the final version of the bill unless the house drops many of its costly provisions . senate leaders had_hoped to be_able to send a compromise version of the measure to president_bush by the end of the week , but speaker foley said_0 that was n't likely . failure to pass the bill meant that $ 16.1 billion in across-the-board spending_cuts took_effect monday under the gramm-rudman budget law . the bill must_be enacted before the cuts can_be restored .
