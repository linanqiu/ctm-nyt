judging from the americana in haruki murakami 's `` a wild sheep chase '' -lrb- kodansha , 320 pages , $_18.95 -rrb- , baby_boomers on both_sides of the pacific have a_lot in common . although set in japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely western , especially american . characters drink salty dogs , whistle `` johnny b. goode '' and watch bugs bunny reruns . they read mickey spillane and talk_about groucho and harpo . they worry_about their careers , drink too_much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs . this is japan ? for an american reader , part_of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary american lore . it 's also refreshing to read a japanese author who clearly does_n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique japanese , unfathomable by outsiders . if `` a wild sheep chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the japanese are more like us than most of us think_0 . that 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` a wild sheep chase '' is rooted in reality . it 's imaginative and often funny . a disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a stanford degree . he has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly . along the way , he meets a solicitous christian chauffeur who offers the hero god 's phone number ; and the sheep man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin . the 40-year-old mr. murakami is a publishing sensation in japan . a more recent novel , `` norwegian wood '' -lrb- every japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in beatles lyrics -rrb- , has sold more_than four million copies since kodansha published it in 1987 . but he is just one of several youthful writers -- tokyo 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in japan . their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of americana . in robert whiting 's `` you gotta have wa '' -lrb- macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -rrb- , the beatles give way to baseball , in the nipponese version 0 we would_be hard put to call a `` game . '' as mr. whiting describes it , nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . '' `` wa '' is japanese for `` team spirit '' and japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it . a player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average . polls once named tokyo giants star tatsunori hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of japan . but other than the fact_that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending_on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the tokyo giants , for_example , must always wear ties when on the road . `` you gotta have wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how american ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in japan . despite the enormous sums of money 0 they_'re paid to stand up at a japanese plate , a good number decide 0 it 's not worth it and run for home . `` funny business '' -lrb- soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 -rrb- by gary katzenstein is anything but . it 's the petulant complaint of an impudent american whom sony hosted for a year while he was on a luce fellowship in tokyo -- to the regret of both parties . in sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , mr. katzenstein describes how sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers_' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker . some of his observations about japanese management style are on the mark . it 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general_manager , and that sony was chary of letting a young , short-term american employee take on any responsibility . all of this must have_been enormously frustrating to mr. katzenstein , who went to sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another walkman . but sony ultimately took a lesson from the american management books and fired mr. katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable akio morita , founder of sony . it 's a shame 0 their meeting never took_place . mr. katzenstein certainly would_have learned something , and it 's even possible 0 mr. morita would_have too . ms. kirkpatrick , the journal 's deputy editorial features editor , worked in tokyo for three_years . more and more corners of the globe are becoming free
