you_know what the law of averages is , do_n't you ? it 's what 1 -rrb- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather_than bo jackson ; 2 -rrb- cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -rrb- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes . baseball , that game of the long_haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the san_francisco giants in the world_series last weekend . the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the chicago cubs in the national league playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team oakland a 's , the gang that had_been done unto similarly by the los_angeles dodgers and orel hershiser in last_year 's tournament . morever , much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up 0 to do . in game two , on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a_lot of the catching up was done by the a 's catcher , terry steinbach . he hit a 2-0 pitch from rick reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed . so what if steinbach had struck just seven home_runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the a 's lineup . `` if_you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can_happen , '' he later remarked . on saturday_night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no_doubt , future droughts . mark mcgwire , the big , red-haired oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more_than he 'd had in the five-game dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 . the a-men batting nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision . right-hander dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other_side of the saturday ledger . that he was the a 's winningest pitcher during its american league campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs , indicates 0 he may_have some evening up coming , but with the way_0 his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might_not be this_week . the same goes for mike moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in sunday 's contest . `` every guy 0 they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled giant manager roger craig . he 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks_like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat . the upshot of the downshoot is that the a 's go_into san_francisco 's candlestick_park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest . the stat 0 to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -lrb- 29 of 39 -rrb- that took 2-0 series leads went on to win it all . that 's not an_average 0 to soothe giant rooters . one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart -lrb- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` desire , '' do_n't you think ? -rrb- would_have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm . partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of oakland coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at_least as far as i could see . a few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams . ``_i 'm for the giants today , but only because_they lost yesterday . i love 'em both . the only_thing 0 i_'m rooting for is for the series to go seven games , '' said david williams , a sacramento septuagenarian , at the coliseum before sunday 's go . the above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility . i choose to believe_0 it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact_that just about everyone out here , including the a 's and giants , is originally from somewhere else . suffice it to say that if this were a new_york yankees-mets series , or one between the chicago cubs and white sox -lrb- hey , it 's possible -rrb- , you_'d need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets . anyway , the a 's gave you a_lot of heroes 0 to root for . in the opening game , besides steinbach and stewart , there was walt weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery . he was flawless afield -lrb- ditto in game two -rrb- , moved a runner along in the a 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally . such is his_reputation among the east_bay bashers that when he hit his first career home_run last season , the fan who caught it agreed_to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph . not his autograph ; power-hitter mcgwire 's . an a 's co-hero of the second game was rickey henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation . he smoked toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate sunday , along_with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run . `` when_you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured . the cold guys in the set were will clark , kevin mitchell and matt williams , the giants ' 3-4-5 hitters . they combined for 25 hits , six home_runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the cubs . they went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies . it 's that last set of numbers , as_much as anything_else , that gives the giants hope in the series games 0 to come . ``_i believe in the law of averages , '' declared san_francisco batting coach dusty baker after game two . ``_i 'd_rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come_up for the other_side than a good hitter who 's cold . '' but the old dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side . `` when it goes , you never know when_you 'll get it back , '' he said . `` that 's baseball .
