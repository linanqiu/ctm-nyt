is an american secretary of state seriously suggesting_that the khmer_rouge should_help govern cambodia ? apparently so . there_are no easy choices in cambodia , but we ca_n't imagine that it benefits the u.s. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in cambodia . now that vietnam appears to have pulled_out its occupation army , the state_department is talking again about accepting an `` interim '' coalition_government in the cambodian capital of phnom penh . the coalition would include the current vietnamese-backed hun sen regime , the two non-communist resistance groups led_by son sann and prince sihanouk , and the khmer_rouge . the aim would_be to end the guerrilla war for control of cambodia by allowing the khmer_rouge a small share of power . the state_department says that any khmer_rouge participation would_have to be `` minimal . '' the usual problem with including communists in `` interim '' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require 0 they squeeze out everyone_else . recall that nicaragua 's sandinistas came into managua as partners in a coalition_government with anti-somoza moderates . within_two years , the moderates were exiled or in prison , nicaragua had gone communist , and the sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in latin_america and threatening their neighbors . in laos , when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned_out 0 they_were opening the door to communist domination . even mao tse-tung 's china began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number_of smaller , non-communist parties . what complicates the scene in cambodia is that the current regime is already communist , as are its vietnamese overseers back in hanoi , as are the khmer_rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups . it 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition_government , but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear . that would_leave hun sen and the khmer_rouge . the hun sen regime has sent thousands_of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building cambodia 's equivalent of the berlin_wall near the thai border . the khmer_rouge , however , carry an unsurpassed record for cambodian tyranny . these utopians caused the deaths -- by starvation , disease or execution -- of well over one million cambodians . the cambodian horror was so bad that the vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief . the world might want to believe_that the khmer_rouge ca_n't still be such bad guys , just as in the late_1970s it was reluctant_to credit the reports of genocide then taking_place . but there_is no solid evidence that the khmer_rouge have changed . some of our sources in thailand say_0 the notorious old khmer_rouge leader , pol pot , has_been holed up this_summer in khmer_rouge camps near the thai-cambodian border . so it 's difficult to swallow the notion_that mr._baker is willing_to accept conditions that would help the khmer_rouge set_up shop again in phnom penh . true , prince sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition , at_least for this_week . but prince sihanouk has backed all_sorts of ideas over the years , and done rather better by himself than by cambodia . nor should the u.s. worry much about offending china , which still aids the khmer_rouge . it 's time 0 the state_department recognized that china does_not play by gentlemen 's rules . for the u.s. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on indochina 's bleak scene could only disturb america 's allies elsewhere . it would_be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such_as the philippines or peru to conclude the following : fight viciously enough and the u.s. , under the banner of pragmatism , might eventually help negotiate your way to victory . u.s. diplomacy has done it before , and it will likely do it again . the administration and congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military_aid to cambodia 's non-communists . but now the possibility of `` diplomatic movement '' -lrb- vietnam 's withdrawal , the baker initiative -rrb- has put that plan on hold , with the proviso that if the going got rough , the u.s. would then rearm the opposition . why the timidity ? at the very least , the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer_rouge and cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents . when that day comes , it would_be particularly awful to know that the united_states sat on military_aid and deprived these people of the means 0 to_settle their fate with at_least a little honor .
