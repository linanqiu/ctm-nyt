office market weakens in overbuilt northeast the northeast office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s . foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated_with the real_estate market in the southwest , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving northeast . some projects are now in the hands of lenders , including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in little falls , n.j . the owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in king of prussia , pa. , have advertised for new financing . rising office vacancy rates in fairfield county , conn. , have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans . and in suburban boston , developers are_bracing for cutbacks in the computer_industry , a major user of office_space . many troubled properties have n't been foreclosed on and are hard 0 to identify , says_0 albert i. berger , who_heads the secaucus , n.j. , office of helmsley-spear inc. , a real_estate brokerage . owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through `` deeds in lieu of foreclosure . '' often , developers stay on as property manager . real_estate analyst lloyd lynford says_0 the northeast 's distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates . but in today 's overbuilt market , tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners . on average , mr. lynford says_0 , it now takes three to 3_1\/2 years to fill new office_space , compared_with 2_1\/2 years in 1988 . beverly_hills comes to suburban tokyo why_should the japanese cross the pacific to buy american real_estate when they_can simply recreate it at home ? tokyu development_corp. is spending $_500 million to build american-style luxury homes in suburban tokyo with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts . the japanese company hired richardson nagy martin , a newport_beach , calif. , architectural firm , to design what the japanese press has dubbed `` the beverly_hills of tokyo . '' instead of japan 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` one hundred hills '' development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots . that 's more_than 10_times the usual housing site size . buyers with $_6 million 0 to spend can select from 11 designs , including a mediterranean-inspired california style , a traditional yankee look and designs inspired by midwestern architect frank lloyd wright . there_are spacious living rooms and baths , plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for removing shoes to suit japanese life styles . exteriors are faced_with brick , wood or stone , but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete . ``_we were disappointed 0 we could_n't use wood , ''_says architect walter j. richardson , `` but the japanese only want stronger materials . '' at $_1,000 per square_foot , the japanese want the feeling of indestructibility , he_explains 0 , not to mention protection_from possible earthquake_damage . housing developers try brand-name buildings residential builders , faced_with a more competitive market , are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique to establish brand-name identity . `` one of the difficulties 0 people in real_estate have is that each product is like starting a new company , or starting a new line in the fashion business , ''_says l. robert lieb president of mountain development_corp. in west paterson , n.j . so he 's using `` river '' in many project names . `` it 'll never be like what bristol-myers does , '' he_adds , `` but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks . '' weingarten-siegel group_inc. of manalapan , n.j. , has built cross creek pointe , allegro pointe and other pointes in new_jersey . caspi development corp of armonk , n.y. , has_developed two apartment buildings called classic and plans a third . developer steve caspi says_0 the same brand name indicates consistent quality , `` regardless of location , design or amenities . '' the leader in real_estate brand names is developer ara hovnanian . his entry-price condos are labeled society hill . beacon hill is for `` move-up '' town houses , and nob hill , for single-family houses . because of standardized designs , mr. hovnanian says_0 , `` a buyer can visualize society hill regardless of where it is . '' quake not likely_to jolt the commercial market the earthquake in san_francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real_estate investors . ``_i think_0 there 's a disease called buyer 's regret , and i_'m sure_0 it 's running rampant at this moment , but it gets cured in a short period of time , ''_says kenneth leventhal , co-managing partner of kenneth leventhal &_co. , a los_angeles accounting_firm specializing_in real_estate . `` if i were buying a building in san_francisco now the first thing 0 i_'d do is insist on a structural inspection , then i_'d delay a little , stall a little . '' but like other real_estate professionals accustomed to california 's quake risks , mr. leventhal anticipates little long-term change in the city 's commercial real_estate market . still , local builders are eager to tell the world that most of san_francisco does_n't look_like the tv images of destruction . planners of the urban land institute real_estate conference this_week hastily added a panel on the quake 's effects . `` the message is 0 we build 'em right , ''_says peter bedford , a california developer and officer at urban land institute . `` there 's seven million square_feet of space that 's doing great .
