treasury_secretary nicholas_brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange_commission the power to close the stock_markets in periods of crisis . in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee , mr._brady disputed the view of sec_chairman richard_breeden , who told a house panel wednesday that he does_n't want the ability_to halt the markets . mr._breeden contended_that discretionary power could have an impact_on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might_be closed . he_added that the president already_has the power to close the markets in an_emergency . but mr._brady argued_that the sec is closer to the markets and in a better position 0 to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should_be closed . separately , mr._brady said_0 he asked the working group on financial_markets to determine_whether futures margins are too_low . he_noted that some minimum margin_requirements have_been reduced to levels below those before the 1987_crash . `` this raises_questions whether futures and equity margin_requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' mr._brady said . margins are the amount of money 0 an_investor needs to put_up to buy or sell a futures_contract . margins on the futures_exchanges typically are raised and lowered according_to market_volatility . the chicago_mercantile exchange margins for the standard_& poor_'s 500_stock-index futures stood_at $_10,000 a contract for speculators and $_5,000 for hedgers before oct._16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 . margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct._19 , 1987 . currently , they stand at $ 12,000 for speculators , who are typically individuals and non-member traders , and $ 6,000 for hedgers , which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks . mr._brady also said_0 he_expects the leveraged_buy-out phenomenon to `` end under -lrb- its -rrb- own weight . '' asked_whether there_is anything 0 congress should do to curb the lbo boom , mr._brady responded , ``_i think_0 the lbo phenomenon , -lrb- while -rrb- it wo_n't stop completely , will_be a thing of the past . '' before taking any action , he advised the panel to `` see what the market has produced as a cure . '' mr._brady also agreed with senators ' concerns_about recent stock-market_volatility , and said_0 he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks . but he_added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual_funds and pension_funds . the former wall_street executive refused_to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program_trading , which has recently become a larger part_of the trading in the market and has_been blamed for accelerating the drop two_weeks ago . ``_i do not have a view of whether we should do_anything about program_trading at this time , '' he said . but mr._brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both_houses of congress will try_to push through this session . that bill , proposed by the sec last_year , would_require brokerage_firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock_markets . the bill also would_give the sec the power to close the markets , a discretion that former sec_chairman david ruder wanted but mr._breeden does_n't . mr._brady and senators agreed_to have their staffs meet within the next_week to start fine-tuning the bill .
