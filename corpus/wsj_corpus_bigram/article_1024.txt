the record corn-buying binge by the soviet_union is causing serious bottlenecks in the u.s. grain pipeline . the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains 0 to move the recently harvested midwest crop to ports for loading onto soviet ships . river barge rates have soared 40_% this_fall from a year_earlier . railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business . and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this_month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop 0 to meet their obligations to the soviets . the soviet_union bought roughly 310 million_bushels of u.s._corn in october , which is the most ever sold to the soviet_union in one_month from the u.s. . the soviet_union wants much of it delivered by january , which would_be a strain in most years . but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi_river , on which flows much of the u.s._corn that is shipped overseas . ``_we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said william dunton , a u.s. agriculture_department transportation expert . `` it is going_to be real tight . '' because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains , the water level on the upper section of the mississippi_river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number_of barges 0 their tows push at one time . in a few_weeks , many barges probably_wo n't be_able to operate fully loaded south of st._louis because the u.s. army corps of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the missouri river , which feeds into the mississippi_river . the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two_weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it . barge rates on the mississippi_river sank yesterday on speculation_that widespread rain this_week in the midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation . but the army corps of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this_month . at st._louis , the water level of the mississippi_river is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an_additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the missouri river is slowed , an army corps spokesman_said 0 . similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last_year in the wake_of the worst drought in 50 years . so_far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the chicago_board of trade . many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn_futures contracts traded there to calculate the price 0 they offer to buy corn from farmers . at the board of trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for december_delivery slipped 3.5 cents_a bushel to_settle at $ 2.375 a_bushel . corn prices have_been sluggish this_fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought . with the harvest winding down , however , some_analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as u.s. exporters try_to gather the corn 0 they_are obligated to deliver . farmers are in the best position of many years 0 to push up corn prices . because the drought reduced u.s. stockpiles , they have more_than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . in parts of iowa , for_example , some grain_elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a_bushel for corn . many farmers probably would n't sell until prices_rose at_least 20 cents_a bushel , said_0 lyle reed , president of chicago central & pacific railroad co. of waterloo , iowa . it is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . although u.s._corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake_of the drought , the agriculture_department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins . some_analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn_futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation . `` the public is buying the market when in reality there_is plenty_of grain 0 to be shipped , '' said bill biedermann , allendale inc. research_director . although much of this_country 's export corn goes to new_orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the mississippi_river by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port . ports in the great lakes and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure_on new_orleans . one railroad , for_example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from indiana to baltimore . and it is n't clear that the soviet_union will stay on its record buying pace . the soviet orders were compressed into the month of october because of delays . the soviet_union usually begins buying u.s. crops earlier in the fall . but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as_well as budget problems . in other_commodity markets yesterday : energy : crude_oil futures_prices increased in moderate_trading , but much of the action was in heating_oil . prices_rose on the news that a sizable west_german refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight european market . heating_oil for november_delivery ended at 58.64 cents_a gallon , up one cent on the new_york mercantile_exchange . west_texas intermediate for december_delivery advanced 22_cents to $ 19.94 a_barrel . gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began monday . precious_metals : futures_prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets . december_delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an_ounce to $ 377.60 . december_silver declined 6.50 cents an_ounce to $ 5.2180 . january_platinum was down $ 5.70 an_ounce at $ 494.50 . precious_metals , gold in particular , currently are_being influenced more by stock_market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according_to william o'neill , vice_president of research at elders futures in new_york . `` the recent rally in precious_metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said . yesterday , the stock_market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious_metals traders , he said_0 . silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said_0 . silver is also under_pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the commodity_exchange , he said_0 . yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according_to an exchange spokesman . copper : futures_prices partially recovered monday 's declines because chilean miners voted to strike . the december_contract rose 1.20 cents_a pound to $ 1.14 . in chile , workers at two copper mines , los bronces and el soldado , which belong to the exxon-owned minera disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an_analyst said_0 . reasons for the walkout , the analyst said_0 , included a number_of procedural issues , such_as a right to strike . the analyst noted_that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks . in the case of copper , he said_0 , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand_for futures_contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying_interest for the metal . also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted 0 , was a report by chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an_indication of what the full report might hold . the purchasing management association of chicago 's october index_rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below_50 % . the september index was 47.1 % . a reading below_50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading_above 50_% points to expansion . the chicago report raised the possibility that the october survey of the national_association of purchasing management would also show a reading_above 50_% .
