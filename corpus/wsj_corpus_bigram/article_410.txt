sotheby_'s inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid_off . the new_york arm of the london-based auction_house auctioned off the estate of john t. dorrance jr. , the campbell 's soup co. heir , for $ 131 million last_week , a record for a single-owner art collection . that total was below the $_140 million 0 the auction_house estimated 0 the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure_that an_unprecedented financial arrangement 0 sotheby_'s had made with the dorrance_family proved profitable to the auction_house . sotheby_'s provided the dorrance_family a guarantee of at_least $_100 million , and as_much as $ 120_million , to_obtain the collection , people_familiar with the transaction said_0 , thus taking a greater_than usual financial interest in the property 0 to be_sold . the dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings . an henri matisse , auctioned last wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist . in_addition , a_handful of paintings from the dorrance collection remain to be_sold at sotheby_'s annual old_masters paintings auction in january .
