banks are continuing to go after individual_investors , despite falling interest_rates . yields_on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about_half the rate of so-called jumbo cds this_week , according_to banxquote money markets , an information service based here . investors can_get slightly_higher yields_on deposits below $_50,000 than they_can on deposits of $ 90,000 and up . `` banks want to remain competitive , '' said norberto mehl , chairman of banxquote . `` october is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand ... among people leaving the stock_market . '' some bankers are reporting more inquiries than_usual about cds since friday . `` reports from branches are that there has_been greater interest in the last day or so , '' said steven braitman , a vice_president at chemical_bank in new_york . chemical said_0 deposits monday were about $_5 million higher_than usual and it_expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds_from sales of stock . `` this is no time 0 to be playing in the street ... the dow has more ups and downs than an elevator , '' proclaimed an advertisement monday in new_york newspapers , touting lincoln_savings bank 's one-year cd . harold jones , lincoln 's chief retail banking officer , said_0 there has n't_yet been `` a discernible response , '' although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week . friday_'s market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for cd rollovers , when a number_of banks and thrifts already have promotions under_way . first national_bank of boston , for_example , is offering certain new depositors an_extra quarter of a percentage_point on_six-month and 12-month cds . some banks actually boosted yields_on the shortest term cds in the latest_week . new_york 's citibank , for_instance , increased the yield on small-denomination three-month cds to 8_% from 7.9 % . on average , however , three-month cds at major_banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage_point less_than they_were a week ago . average yields_on cds aimed_at individual_investors fell less_than half as_much as yields_on treasury_bills sold at monday 's auction . six-month cds of $_50,000 and less yielded an_average 8.02_% in the week_ended tuesday , down from 8.10 % , according_to banxquote . the yield on_six-month t-bills fell to 7.82_% on monday , from 8.01 % the week before . meanwhile , the average_yield on_six-month cds of more_than $ 90,000 fell to 7.93_% in the latest_week , according_to banxquote , from 8.10 % the week before . mr. mehl noted_that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination cds , but yields_on cds aimed_at the individual investor are boosted_by more frequent compounding . cds sold by major_brokerage houses , which like jumbo cds tend_to closely follow interest_rate trends , also posted larger drops in yields . a six-month , broker-sold cd , for_example , was yielding an_average 8.09_% in the latest_week , a fifth of a percentage_point lower_than the week before . in late april , when interest_rates were at their recent highs , short-term cds sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage_point or more higher_than banks . cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming_weeks . `` what_happened in the stock_market and the bigger trade_deficit '' reported yesterday `` make it unlikely that short-term_interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said mr. mehl of banxquote . `` even_before the market drop , rates were down about_half a percentage_point , '' said robert_j. hutchinson , senior_vice president for retail marketing at manufacturers_hanover trust_co. in new_york . `` that puts pressure_on cd rates .
