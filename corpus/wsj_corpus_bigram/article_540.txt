if_you think_0 you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good_news and bad_news . you_'re probably right , and you are n't alone . a new gallup poll study commissioned by the new_york business group on health , found that a full 25_% of the work_force at companies may suffer_from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13_% suffering_from depression . the study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . it is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the new_york business group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . the stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said_0 leon j. warshaw , executive_director of the business group . in presenting the study late_last week , dr. warshaw estimated 0 the cost of these types_of disorders to business is substantial . occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . in terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression . he_added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . ``_we hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they_can do_something about them , dr. warshaw said_0 . early intervention into these types_of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated_with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too_long . even the courts are beginning to recognize the link_between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according_to a survey by the national council on compensation insurance . but although 56_% of the respondents in the study indicated_that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there_is still a social stigma associated_with people seeking help . the disorders , which 20_years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , ''_says 0 robert m.a. hirschfeld , of the national_institute of mental health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings . the poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65_% of those in companies of more_than 15,000 employees saying_0 stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55_% of those in companies with fewer_than 4,000 employees agreeing . the poll also_noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies . more_than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company . mid-sized companies were most affected_by talk of layoffs or plant closings . the study , which received funding from upjohn co. , which_makes several drugs 0 to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 0 47_% of the managers said_0 stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30_% of those polled . although dr. warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . '' he also_noted that various work environments , such_as night work , have their_own `` stressors . '' ``_we all like stress , but there 's a limit , ''_says paul d'arcy , of rohrer , hibler & replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting_firm . the problem , says_0 mr. d'arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very_hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .
