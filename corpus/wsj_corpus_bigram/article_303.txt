william d. forrester , president of the u.s.-u.s.s.r. trade and economic council , has a warning for u.s. companies trying_to do business in the soviet_union . `` it 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' mr. forrester says . ``_we are not trying_to encourage everyone . '' undeterred by such words of caution , corporate_america is flocking to moscow , lured by a huge untapped market and mikhail_gorbachev 's attempt_to overhaul the soviet economy . doing_business with the russians , once the pursuit of a_handful of hardened veterans , has_become the goal of such major companies as general_motors corp. , federal_express corp. and procter_& gamble_co. , as_well as a cluster of smaller firms . reflecting the new-found interest , more_than 140 u.s. companies are taking part in a moscow exhibition organized by mr. forrester 's trade_group . but while u.s. interest may_be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no_sign of abating . alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy , western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika , the restructuring of the soviet economy . executives_say 0 mr._gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as_well as opportunities . changing legislation has opened the field to thousands_of inexperienced soviet players , many who promise more_than they_can deliver . and some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the soviet parliament and the governments of the nation_'s republics . `` you have to go out to all your constituents , ''_says james h. giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by u.s. firms to break into the soviet market , involving investment of more_than $_5 billion in some two dozen joint_ventures . as_part of that attempt , by the american trade consortium , mr. giffen says_0 he spends a_lot of time lobbying . growing public fears_about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . over the past_two years , soviet ministries have_been talking to international firms , including occidental_petroleum co. and combustion engineering inc. of the u.s. , montedison s.p.a. of italy and several japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants . the plans have come under fire from soviet environmentalists , and officials_say 0 many are_likely to be scaled_back or dropped . whatever the difficulties , mr._gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade . for political as_well as economic reasons , u.s. companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point 0 he underscored by spending two_hours walking around the u.s._trade show last_week . talking to a small group of u.s. executives afterwards , mr._gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in u.s.-soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $_3 billion annually . the u.s. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint_ventures , behind west_germany , finland and italy . according_to several people present at the meeting , mr._gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the u.s. , possibly at his next summit meeting with president_bush . judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived soviet consumers are more_than ready for u.s. products . hundreds_of people lined_up every_day at the colgate-palmolive co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste , a commodity in chronically short supply here . and unruly crowds at rjr_nabisco inc. 's booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free camel cigarette sticker . some u.s. products are filtering into the soviet market under an_emergency import program . both colgate and procter_& gamble have received big orders for toothpaste , soap and detergents . the american trade consortium says_0 it is planning to ship some $_500 million of consumer_goods , financed_by bank credits , in the first few_months of next_year . but the current soviet purchasing spree may_be a one-time affair . the goal of most u.s. firms -- joint_ventures -- remains elusive . because the soviet ruble is n't convertible_into dollars , marks and other western currencies , companies that hope to set_up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard_currency or find soviet goods 0 they_can take in a counter-trade transaction . international competition for the few soviet goods that can_be sold on world markets is heating up , however . shelley m. zeiger , an entrepreneur from new_jersey who buys soviet porcelain and `` matryoshka '' nesting dolls for export to the u.s. , says_0 west_german companies already have snapped_up much of the production of these items . seeking to overcome the currency problems , mr. giffen 's american trade consortium , which comprises chevron_corp. , rjr , johnson_& johnson , eastman_kodak co. , and archer-daniels-midland co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme 0 to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned chevron oil project . several medical concerns , including pfizer inc. , hewlett-packard_co. , colgate and abbott laboratories intend_to pursue a similar consortium approach . `` it 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other_countries , ''_says dennis a. sokol , president of medical service partners inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together . some u.s. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale . one group seeks to publish a u.s.-soviet medical journal in conjunction with the u.s.s.r. ministry of health . according_to richard p. mills , a boston-based official of the u.s. partner , 10,000 copies of the quarterly will_be printed in russian from next_year . it will_be financed_by advertisements from u.s. companies and by simultaneous publication of an english-language journal containing details of soviet medical advancements . ``_we found a market niche , '' mr. mills boasts . `` it 's truly entrepreneurial .
