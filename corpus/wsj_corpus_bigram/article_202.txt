in the aftermath of the stock_market 's gut-wrenching 190-point_drop on_oct. 13 , kidder , peabody_& co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed_at quashing the country 's_second-largest program_trader . the target of their wrath ? their_own employer , kidder_peabody . since october 's minicrash , wall_street has_been shaken by an_explosion of resentment against program_trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock_prices reeling in minutes . but the heated fight over program_trading is about much more_than a volatile stock_market . the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards . program_trading itself , according_to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving_force of the marketplace . the evidence indicates_that program_trading did_n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on_oct. 13 , though it may_have exacerbated it . on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on_wall street -- the new guard -- consisting_of high-tech computer wizards at the major_brokerage firms , their pension_fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures_exchanges . these are the main proponents of program_trading . defending their ramparts are wall_street 's old_guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money_managers , tens of thousands_of stock brokers , the new_york stock_exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor_traders , known_as specialists , who make markets in their stocks . so_far , wall_street 's old_guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors . the chicago_mercantile exchange , a major futures marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program_traders during a rapidly falling stock_market , and the big_board is_expected today to approve some additional restrictions_on program_trading . stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock_market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost_all the big investment_banking houses have abandoned index_arbitrage , a common form of program_trading , for their_own accounts in the past_few days . a few , such_as giant merrill_lynch &_co. , now refuse even to do index_arbitrage trades for clients . the old_guard 's assault on program_trading and its practitioners has_been fierce and broad-based , in part because some old_guard members feel 0 their very livelihood is at stake . some , such_as traditional money_manager neuberger & berman , have_taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on_wall street . '' big_board stock specialists , in a bold palace revolt , began shortly_after oct._13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big_board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program_trading . charles wohlstetter , the chairman of contel corp. who is rallying other ceos to the anti-program trading cause , says_0 he has received `` countless '' letters offering support . `` they said universally , without a single exception : do_n't even compromise . kill it , '' he_says . wall_street 's new guard is n't likely_to take all this lying down for long , however . its new products and trading techniques have_been highly profitable . program_trading money_managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this_country , and the pressures on such money_managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability_to move rapidly in and out the market that program_trading gives_them . what 's more , the last time 0 major wall_street firms said_0 they_were getting_out of program_trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987_crash -- they waited a few_months and then sneaked back_into it . even some members of the old_guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the new guard . last_week , robert_m. bradley , one of the big_board 's most respected floor_traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered . he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big_board chairman_john j._phelan jr. in which he said_0 the big_board is too focused_on machines , rather_than people . he said_0 the exchange is `` headed for a real crisis '' if program_trading is n't curbed . ``_i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more_than a casino , '' mr. bradley wrote . the battle has_turned into a civil_war at some firms and organizations , causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee . at kidder , a unit of general_electric co. , and other big brokerage_firms , stockbrokers battle their_own firm 's program_traders a few floors away . corporations like contel denounce program_trading , yet contel has in the past hired pension_fund managers like bankers_trust co. that are also big program_traders . the big_board -- the nation_'s premier stock_exchange -- is sharply divided_between its floor_traders and its top_executives . its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs . but the big_board 's leadership -- over the specialists ' protests -- two_weeks ago began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program_trading . `` a_lot of people would like to go_back to 1970 , '' before program_trading , mr._phelan said_0 this_week . ``_i would like to go_back to 1970 . but we are not_going back to 1970 . '' again and again , program-trading 's critics raise the `` casino '' theme . they say_0 greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation_'s free-enterprise system , turning the stock_market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small_investor . `` the public did_n't come to the market to play a game ; they_can go to off-track betting for that , ''_says 0 a. brean murray , chairman of brean murray , foster securities , a traditional money management firm . the program_traders , on the other_hand , portray old-fashioned stock_pickers as the neanderthals of the industry . critics like mr. murray `` are_looking for witches , and people_who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , ''_says 0 j. thomas allen , president of advanced investment_management inc. , a pittsburgh firm that runs a $_200 million fund that uses index_arbitrage . `` just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection . '' for all the furor , there_is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index_arbitrage , the most_controversial type of computer-assisted program_trading . like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take_advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the new_york stock_exchange and the chicago futures_markets . that divergence is what stock index traders seek . when it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks -lrb- such_as the 500_stocks that constitute the standard_& poor_'s 500 stock index -rrb- in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more_expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit . such program_trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds . a program trade of $_5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $_25,000 . to_keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives , traders must seize every opportunity 0 their computers find . the speed with which such program_trades take_place and the volatile price_movements 0 they_can cause are what program_trading critics profess to despise . `` if_you continue to do this , the investor becomes frightened -- any investor : the odd lotter , mutual_funds and pension_funds , ''_says larry zicklin , managing_partner at neuberger & berman . but many experts and traders_say that program_trading is n't the main_reason for stock-market gyrations . ``_i have not seen one iota of evidence '' 0 to support restrictions_on program_trading , says_0 a vanderbilt university finance professor , hans stoll , an authority on the subject . says the big_board 's mr._phelan , `` volatility is greater_than program_trading . '' the oct._13 plunge was_triggered not by program_traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $_6.79 billion buy-out of ual_corp . unable_to unload ual and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock 0 they had . while program_trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit_breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program_trading impossible . susan del signore , head trader_at travelers investment_management co. , says_0 critics are ignoring `` the role 0 the -lcb- takeover_stock -rcb- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . '' many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' she_says 0 , and they `` have to sell when things look_like they fall apart . '' like virtually everything on_wall street , the program-trading battle is over money , and the traditionalists have_been losing out on bundles of it to the new guard in recent_years . take the traditional money_managers , or `` stock_pickers , '' as they_are derisively known among the computer jockeys . traditional stock managers like to charge 50_cents to 75_cents for every $_100 0 they manage for big_institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors . yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with , much_less beat , the returns of standard benchmarks like the s&p not surprisingly , old-style money_managers have_been losing clients to giant stock-index_funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the s&p_500 . the indexers charge only a few pennies per $_100 managed . today , about $_200 billion , or 20_% of all pension-fund stock investments , is held by index funds . the new wall_street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 big_board stock-specialist firms . these small but influential floor_brokers long have earned fat returns of 30_% to 40_% a year on their capital , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual_stocks . the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell . and they believe_0 the big_board , under mr._phelan , has abandoned their interest . the son of a specialist and once one himself , mr._phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so_much -- to_keep index funds and other program_traders from taking their business to overseas markets . meanwhile , specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market_volatility . `` when the sell_programs hit , you_can hear the order printers start to go '' on the big_board trading floor , says_0 one specialist there . `` the buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks , he_contends 0 . no_one is more unhappy with program_trading than the nation_'s stockbrokers . they_are still trying_to lure back small_investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market_crash and the market 's swings since_then . `` small_investors are absolutely dismayed that wall_street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , ''_says raymond a. mason , chairman of regional broker legg_mason inc. in baltimore . stockbrokers ' business and pay has_been falling . last_year , the average broker earned_$ 71,309 , 24_% lower_than in 1987 . corporate executives resent that their company 's stock has_been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket . index traders who buy all 500_stocks in the s&p_500 often do_n't even know_what the companies 0 they own actually do , complains 0 andrew sigler , chairman of champion_international corp . `` do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ? oh , you_'re in the paper business , '' is one reaction 0 mr. sigler says_0 he 's gotten from his big_institutional shareholders . by this september , program_traders were doing a record 13.8 % of the big_board 's average_daily trading_volume . among the top practitioners were wall_street blue bloods : morgan_stanley &_co. , kidder_peabody , merrill_lynch , salomon_brothers inc. and painewebber_group inc . but then came oct._13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the old_guard , particularly against index_arbitrage . the indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die . `` there 's a lynch-mob psychology right_now , ''_says the top program-trading official at a wall_street firm . `` wall_street 's cash cow has_been gored , but i_do n't_think 0 anyone has proven that index_arbitrage is the problem . '' too_much money is at stake for program_traders to give up . for_example , stock-index_futures began trading in chicago in 1982 , and within_two years they_were the fastest-growing futures_contract ever launched . stock futures_trading has minted dozens_of millionaires in their 20s and 30s . now , on a good day , chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big_board trades in stock . now the stage is set for the battle to play out . the anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from congress . program_traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca_n't be_allowed to have their way , ''_says 0 rep. edward markey , a massachusetts democrat . ``_we have to have a system that says to those largest investors : ` sit_down ! you will not panic , you will not put the financial system in jeopardy . ' '' but the prospects_for legislation that targets program_trading is unlikely anytime_soon . many_people , including the big_board , think that it 's too_late to put the genie back in the bottle . the big_board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being_considered , big_board officials_say 0 . `` you_'re not_going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , ''_says vanderbilt 's prof. stoll . `` program_trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . '' short of a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say_0 would take away certain advantages 0 program_traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do_n't . one such proposal regarding stock-index_futures is an_increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks . currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7_% compared_with 50_% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . program_trading critics also want the federal_reserve board , rather_than the futures industry , to set such margins . futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active . higher margins would chase away dozens_of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say . another proposed reform is to have program_traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the great crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower_prices , namely short sellers . the big_board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price . but in 1986 , program_traders received what amounted_to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and futures_markets . a reinstatement of the uptick rule for program_traders would slow their activity considerably . program_traders argue_that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock_markets . james_a. white contributed_to this_article . fundamentalists jihad big_board chairman_john phelan_said yesterday that he could support letting federal_regulators suspend program_trading during wild stock-price swings . thus the band-wagon psychology of recent_days picks up new impetus . index_arbitrage is a common form of program_trading . as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : two_separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca_n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different . in index_arbitrage , the widget is the s&p_500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock_markets largely in new_york . to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the s&p_500 widget in new_york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p_500 widget in chicago . if the money_manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p_500 index , he is_likely to remain fully invested at all times . -lrb- few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more_than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less_than a 100 % position should stocks rise . -rrb- by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3_% to the annual return of the s&p_500 . that represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far_less than what most fundamental stock_pickers claim to seek as their performance objective . the fact_that a vast_majority of fundamentalist money_managers fail to beat the s&p_500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue . as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will_be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p_500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . the new_york stock_exchange 's attempt_to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors_' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares . so if index_arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program_trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so_many observers ? all arguments against program_trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 -rrb- reduced volatility , 2 -rrb- a long-term investment focus , and 3 -rrb- a level_playing field for the small_investor . but many of these reforms are unneeded , even harmful . reducing volatility . an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there_is sufficient difference_between the markets in new_york and chicago 0 to cover all transaction costs . arbitrage does_n't cause volatility ; it responds to it . think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p_500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in chicago . a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures . arbitrage simply transfers his selling_pressure from chicago to new_york , while functioning as a buyer in chicago . the start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move . why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new_york ? perhaps he is willing_to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade . in a competitive market , this investor has many_ways 0 to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives -lrb- both foreign and domestic -rrb- if his volume is profitable 0 for an exchange to handle . if not chicago , then in new_york ; if not the u.s. , then overseas . volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index_arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity . eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less . the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome . if slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future . encouraging long-term investing . we_must be very cautious_about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . '' policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the big_board 's door saying : `` buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! '' the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused_on the long_term . a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks 0 he can tolerate . in point of fact , volatility as measured_by the annualized standard_deviation of daily stock price_movements has frequently been much higher_than it is today . periods before the advent of futures or program_trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market_conditions were undergoing change -lrb- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for_example -rrb- . it is interesting to see the fundamental stock_pickers scream `` foul '' on program_trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty_about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ? some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could_be far worse_than the perceived problem . in using program_trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small_investors for their existing stock-selection products . they may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves . how does a nice new tax , say 5_% , on any financial transaction sound ? that ought_to make_sure 0 we_'re all thinking for the long_term . getting a level_playing field . this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program_trading -- not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause . the loudest of these reformers are money_managers who cater to smaller investors . they continually advise their_clients on which individual_stocks to buy or sell , while their_clients continue to hope for superior performance . even with mutual_funds , the little investor continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk . yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company 0 he follows . almost_all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able_to cope_with its consequences . if spreads available from index_arbitrage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small_investors . the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to_pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis_points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter . cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay . each new trading roadblock is_likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways_0 to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas . legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors . so what is next for program_trading ? left to its_own devices , index_arbitrage will_become more and more_efficient , making it harder and harder 0 to do profitably . spreads will_become so tight that it wo_n't matter which market an_investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit . if government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets -lrb- limits_on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin_requirements , taxation , etc. -rrb- , the end loser will_be the markets themselves . instead , we ought_to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways_0 to trade and transfer capital among all participants . mr._allen 's pittsburgh firm , advanced investment_management inc. , executes program_trades for institutions .
