eastern_airlines ' creditors_committee backed off a move 0 to come_up with its_own alternative proposals to the carrier 's bankruptcy reorganization plans , according_to sources familiar_with the committee . in a meeting in new_york yesterday , the committee put on hold instructions 0 it gave two_weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for eastern 's future , the sources_said 0 . the consultants had_been working to finish a report this_week . that means 0 eastern , a unit of texas_air corp. of houston , can_go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today , when it is_expected to deliver a revised reorganization_plan to the committee . the committee intends_to meet next_week to make a recommendation on the new plan . in another development yesterday , creditors were told that $_40 million 0 they had expected to become available for implementing a reorganization may_not materialize , according_to one source . texas_air has run_into difficulty reselling about $ 20 million of debt_securities because of problems in the junk_bond market , the person said_0 . and plans to raise another $ 20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag , the source said_0 . an eastern spokesman_said `` the $_40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of eastern 's plan . forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant . '' it is unclear what caused the creditors to do an about-face on exploring alternatives to eastern 's new reorganization_plan . however , since eastern first filed for chapter_11 protection march 9 , it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar . because the carrier is still pledging to do that , some committee_members successfully argued_that there 's little reason yet 0 to explore a different plan , according_to one_person familiar_with the creditors_' position . earlier_this month the accounting_firm of ernst_& young and the securities_firm of goldman , sachs_& co. , the experts hired by the creditors , contended_that eastern would_have difficulty meeting earnings targets 0 the airline was projecting . ernst_& young said_0 eastern 's plan would miss projections by $_100 million . goldman said_0 eastern would miss the same mark by at_least $ 120_million . the consultants maintained 0 eastern would n't generate the cash 0 it needs and would_have to issue new debt to meet its targets under the plan . eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts ' report `` completely off base . '' yesterday , joel zweibel , an_attorney for eastern 's creditors_committee , declined to comment_on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look_at other choices and whether they now were asked_not to . he said only that the committee has not_yet taken any position on eastern 's reorganization_plan and that the two_sides were still negotiating . `` in every case , people would like to see a consentual plan , '' he said . eastern and its creditors agreed in july on a reorganization_plan that called for the carrier to sell off $_1.8 billion in assets and to emerge_from chapter_11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size . eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk , its south american routes , which were valued_at $_400 million . such a change meant 0 the reorganization_plan 0 the creditors had agreed on was no_longer valid , and the two_sides had to begin negotiating again . eastern has publicly stated 0 it is exceeding its goals for getting back_into operation and has predicted 0 it would emerge_from chapter_11 proceedings early_next year , operating more flights than it originally had scheduled .
