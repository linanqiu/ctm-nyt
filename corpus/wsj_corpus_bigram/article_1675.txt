the oakland athletics ' four-game sweep over the san_francisco giants in the world_series may widen already-sizable losses that the abc network will incur on the current , final year of its baseball contract . the 1989_series , disrupted by a devastating_earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the san_francisco bay_area , is_likely to end_up as the lowest-rated series of this decade and probably since the event has_been broadcast . the first three games were seen by an_average of only 17_% of u.s. homes , a sharp_decline from the 23.7 % rating for last_year 's series . a final ratings tally from a.c._nielsen co. is due today . the sweep by the a's , whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone giants , will only make things worse for abc , owned_by capital_cities\/abc inc . the network had_been expected to have losses of as_much as $ 20 million on baseball this_year . it is n't clear how_much those losses may widen because of the short series . had the contest gone a full seven games , abc could have reaped an_extra $ 10 million in ad sales on the seventh game alone , compared_with the ad take 0 it would_have received for regular prime-time shows . abc had based its budget for baseball on a six-game series . a network spokesman would n't_comment , and abc_sports officials_declined to be_interviewed . but some industry_executives said_0 abc , in_anticipation of a four-game sweep , limited its losses by jacking up the number_of commercials 0 it aired in the third and fourth games . a world_series telecast typically carries 56 30-second commercials , but by the fourth game abc was cramming in 60 to 62 ads to generate extra revenue . abc 's baseball experience may_be of interest to cbs_inc. , which next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four-year television contract priced_at $_1.06 billion . cbs_sports president neal pilson has conceded only that cbs will have a loss in the first year . but other industry_executives contend 0 the losses could reach $_250 million over four_years and could go even higher if the world_series end in four-game romps . the series typically is among the highest-rated sports events on television . last_year 's series , broadcast by general_electric co. 's nbc , was the lowest-rated series in four_years ; instead of featuring a major east_coast team against a west_coast team , it pitted the los_angeles dodgers against the losing oakland a's . abc 's hurdle was even higher this_year with two teams from the same area . the series got off to a lukewarm start oct._14 with a 16.2 % rating ; the next night it drew 17.4 % of homes . then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days . some people had_hoped 0 abc 's ratings would go up because of the intense focus_on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake . an_analyst 's opinion to that effect even sent capital_cities\/abc shares soaring two_weeks ago . but interest instead decreased . the third_game , last_friday night , drew a disappointing 17.5 rating .
