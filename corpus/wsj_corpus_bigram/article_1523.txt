president_bush and soviet_leader mikhail_gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early december , a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home . the white_house is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo_n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements . rather , senior administration_officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at mr._bush 's_request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders . the two leaders will meet on dec. 2 and 3 , alternating the two_days of meetings between a u.s. and a soviet naval vessel in the mediterranean sea . the unusual seaborne meeting wo_n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next_spring or summer , at which an arms-control treaty is_likely to be_completed . in announcing the meeting yesterday , mr._bush told_reporters at the white_house that neither he nor mr._gorbachev expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . '' instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get `` better acquainted '' and discuss a wide_range of issues without a formal agenda . despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders . mr._gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest 0 he faces at home . american officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the u.s. could help bolster his stature among soviet politicians and academics , whose support he needs . for his part , mr._bush has_been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to mr._gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away_from communism in eastern_europe . a face-to-face meeting with mr._gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it . senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- , who has_been the most_prominent democratic critic of mr._bush 's handling of the soviet relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting . but he_added : `` the mere fact of a meeting does_n't deal_with the substance of policy . '' mr._bush said that the december meeting , which was announced simultaneously in moscow , will_be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two_sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers . `` by doing it in this manner we_can have , i would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances , things of that nature for public consumption , '' mr._bush said . soviet foreign_minister eduard shevardnadze , at a news_conference in moscow , said , `` as the two_sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next_year , they found it useful , i would say even necessary , to hold an_interim informal meeting . '' although no specific agreements are_expected , mr._shevardnadze said `` that does_n't mean_0 they will_be without an agenda . '' if the two leaders cover the subjects that have_been featured in lower level u.s.-soviet meetings , their talks would include human_rights , soviet reforms , regional disputes , relations with allies , economic_cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight narcotics , terrorism and pollution . the president specifically mentioned u.s. economic advice to moscow as a possible topic . mr._gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the u.s. to drop its restrictions_on soviet trade . he recently told a small group of american businessmen in moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement_with the u.s. , possibly at the 1990 summit . the soviets hope 0 a trade agreement would_give them most-favored nation status , which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u.s. . in an_unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- pravda yesterday reported that three million soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005 . economists in moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment_benefits . but one bush_administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will_be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues . `` do_n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic_cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said . `` those things will all come_up , but in a fairly informal way . '' instead , this official said , `` this is vintage george_bush . this was george_bush 's own idea . it 's george_bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . '' aside_from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms , one other issue 0 the soviets are_likely to want to raise is naval force reductions . western analysts_say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once_again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact . that theme has_been a recurring one for soviet military officials for much of this_year . they_argue that as the kremlin follows through on announced_plans to cut land forces -- the soviets ' area of greatest strength -- the u.s. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- washington 's area of greatest superiority . one of the reasons 0 bush_administration aides are anxious to insist_that the coming meeting will_be informal is to_avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former_president reagan 's 1986 meeting with mr._gorbachev in reykjavik , iceland . that meeting sent shivers through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear_weapons without consulting american allies . mr._bush said that he initiated talks_with the soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to mr._gorbachev last july , which the soviet_leader readily accepted . but word of the possible session was closely_held by the president and a_handful of top aides , and word of it did_n't reach many second-level officials until the past_few days . indeed , many senior officials had_been insisting for weeks that mr._bush was n't interested_in such an informal get-together . though president_bush 's political critics at home have_been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with mr._gorbachev , it actually was the arguments of leaders within the soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the december meeting . mr._bush decided 0 he wanted the meeting after talking in europe in july with the leaders of poland and hungary , who urged him to support mr._gorbachev 's efforts to transform the soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip_on eastern_europe , a senior aide said_0 . while flying home from those discussions , mr._bush drafted a letter to mr._gorbachev suggesting an informal get-together 0 to precede their formal summit next_year . peter gumbel in moscow contributed_to this_article .
