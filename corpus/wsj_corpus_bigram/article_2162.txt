federal_reserve chairman_alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will_require reducing the federal deficit sharply . mr._greenspan said_0 he and other fed governors endorse a bill by rep. stephen neal -lrb-_d. , n.c. -rrb- that would_require the fed to_pursue policies aimed_at eliminating inflation within five_years . `` such a deadline is attainable , but it would_have costs , '' mr._greenspan told rep. neal 's monetary_policy subcommittee 0 . the fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by reps. lee hamilton -lrb-_d. , ind. -rrb- and byron dorgan -lrb-_d. , n.d. -rrb- -- that , among_other things , would_require the fed to disclose all monetary_policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the fed . in responding to questions , mr._greenspan played down reports of tension_between the fed and the treasury over exchange-rate policy . `` what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics , '' he said . he did_n't elaborate . but the fed is n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest_rates to pull down the dollar 's value . mr._greenspan said_0 the inflation_rate , currently about 4_1\/2 % , `` could_be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but i_do suspect that there might_be some modest loss of economic output . '' in other_words , economic_growth would_be lower and unemployment would_be higher for a few_years . but mr._greenspan , who has repeatedly said_0 the fed 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more_than made up in increased output thereafter . '' he warned_that fed efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless_they are accompanied_by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily . rep. neal 's bill originally called on the fed to reduce the inflation_rate by one percentage_point a year for five_years and to maintain a zero inflation_rate thereafter . he altered the wording to win mr._greenspan 's endorsement . even so , his bill is given little chance of passage . reps. hamilton and dorgan also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the treasury_secretary to the 12-member fed committee that makes monetary_policy . instead , the bill simply calls_for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration_officials . even that met_with mr._greenspan 's disapproval because it might subject the fed `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary_policy away_from long-term strategic goals . '' while each of the hamilton-dorgan proposals represents only a small step , together they would erode the fed 's independence , mr._greenspan said_0 . mr._greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains_taxes as sound economic_policy , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the tax_reform act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income_tax rates .
