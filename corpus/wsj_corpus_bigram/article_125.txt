robert_l. bernstein , chairman and president of random_house inc. , announced his_resignation from the publishing house 0 he has run for 23 years . a successor was n't named , which fueled speculation_that mr._bernstein may_have clashed with s.i. newhouse jr. , whose family company , advance publications_inc. , owns random_house . abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the newhouse empire . in an_interview , mr._bernstein said_0 his departure `` evolved out of discussions_with si newhouse and that 's the decision 0 i reached . '' he declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` it just seemed the right thing 0 to do at this minute . sometimes you just go with your gut . '' mr._bernstein said_0 he will stay until_dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon . mr. newhouse , meanwhile , insisted_that he is n't unhappy with mr._bernstein or the performance of random_house , the largest trade publishing house in the u.s. . the company said_0 the publisher 's annual_sales volume increased to $_800 million from $_40 million during mr._bernstein 's tenure . `` bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly , '' said mr. newhouse . `` the company is doing_well , it 's stable , it 's got good people . bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . '' publishing officials believe_that while random_house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent_years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily . crown publishing_group , acquired last_year , is said to be turning in disappointing results . as a private company , random_house does_n't report its earnings . mr._bernstein , who succeeded bennett cerf , has_been only the second president of random_house since it was founded in 1925 . speculation on his successor centers on a number_of division heads at the house . possible candidates include susan petersen , president of ballantine\/del rey\/fawcett , random_house 's huge and successful paperback division . some say_0 anthony cheetham , head of a recently acquired british company , century hutchinson , could_be chosen . there_is also speculation_that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member 0 to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like robert gottlieb , who left random_house 's alfred a. knopf to run the new_yorker , also owned_by the newhouse family . not included on the most-likely-successor list are joni evans , recruited two_years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random_house , and sonny mehta , president of the prestigious alfred a. knopf unit . when ms. evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly_because she_did n't wish to be a full-time administrator . mr. mehta is widely viewed_as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his_own departure was rumored recently . mr._bernstein , a tall , energetic man_who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent_years on human_rights issues .
