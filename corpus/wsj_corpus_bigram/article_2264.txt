maggie thatcher must_be doing something right ; her political enemies are screaming louder than_ever . mrs._thatcher , who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before mr._bush encountered it , has made clear her opposition to refashioning britain_'s free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in brussels . in return , mrs._thatcher is excoriated from fleet street to paris as an obstructionist . well , it now turns_out that mrs._thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member commonwealth summit in kuala_lumpur to discomfit the holy order of consensus builders . `` a disastrous farce in malaysia , '' screamed the manchester guardian . `` she can no_longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad . '' egad . canada 's brian mulroney and australia 's bob hawke , the paper said_0 , were `` enraged . '' the london times said_0 she had `` contravened protocol . '' as_usual , her sin was saying what she thought . she issued a separate statement , separating herself from a commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions_against south_africa . while supporting the commonwealth `` in utterly condemning apartheid , '' her statement urged it to `` encourage change '' rather_than inflict further punishment on the country 's black population . actually there_is a consensus somewhere on sanctions : in may a gallup poll found that most south_african blacks , 85_% , oppose economic sanctions . still , mrs._thatcher had once_again gone against the grain . malaysia 's prime_minister mahathir mohamad sniffed , `` if everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot , you are out of step . '' mrs._thatcher : `` if it 's one against 48 , i_'m very sorry for the 48 . '' if indeed mrs._thatcher has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is britain_'s mysteriously intractable inflation problem . we_can not , however , join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that mrs._thatcher refuses to get along by going along . it is refreshing to see at_least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs . perhaps mrs._thatcher understands better_than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and britain_'s voters will decide who is right about europe , sanctioning south_africa or running britain_'s economy .
