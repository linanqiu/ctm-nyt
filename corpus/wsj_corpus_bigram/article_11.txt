chicago - sears , roebuck_& co. is struggling as it enters the critical christmas_season . yesterday , the retailing and financial_services giant reported a 16_% drop in third-quarter_earnings to $ 257.5 million , or 75_cents a_share , from a restated $ 305 million , or 80_cents a_share , a year_earlier . but the news was even_worse for sears 's core u.s._retailing operation , the largest in the nation . sears said_0 its u.s. stores had a loss of $ 6.9 million , their first deficit for the period in more_than five_years . analysts estimated that sales at u.s. stores declined in the quarter , too . the results underscore sears 's difficulties in implementing the `` everyday low pricing '' strategy that it adopted in march as_part of a broad attempt_to revive its retailing business . under the new approach , sears set prices that were somewhere_between its old `` regular '' and `` sale '' prices . the company said_0 it would resort far_less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers . sears officials insist 0 they do_n't intend_to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results . instead , a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on `` an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable_goods , '' which account for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume . the new pricing strategy `` is working , '' the spokesman asserted 0 . he_added that , after an_initial surge triggered_by an advertising blitz in march , sears expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect_on revenue . sears has_been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise 0 it is adding to its stores over the next two_years in what it calls `` power formats . '' but analysts_say 0 sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the christmas shopping season . ``_i believe_0 everyday pricing in the current environment does_n't work , ''_says walter loeb of morgan_stanley &_co. , pointing to soft durable-goods sales . `` sears is_likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone_else is offering unusual values . '' in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as sears had_hoped , the giant retailer is now trying new ways_0 to drum_up business without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy . the company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores , and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items . sears is also stepping_up its television ads and changing its message . in a new tv ad , for_instance , a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they_are offering goods for `` 50_% , 60_% and 70_% off . '' by lowering prices throughout its stores , she_says , `` sears has the right idea . '' but the ad also mentions sears 's sales -- a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing . `` when sears has a sale at a special price , '' the woman in the ad declares , `` it 's something 0 you_do n't_want to miss . '' recent surveys by leo j. shapiro &_associates , a market research_firm in chicago , suggest_that sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't_yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise . the number_of people_who said_0 they_were more likely_to shop at sears fell in_september to 37 % from 66 % in march , when sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy . moreover , the number_of people_who spontaneously cited lower_prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to 16_% in_september from 33_% in march . just 5_% of the respondents mentioned brands in_september , up slightly from 2_% in march . only 2_% of the people in_september cited sears 's `` friendly personnel . '' `` the power of price as an_appeal , which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april , has diminished , ''_says george rosenbaum , president of shapiro &_associates . `` you see some improvement in these other_areas , but it 's a very small and slow process . '' for the third_quarter , sears said_0 its total revenue_rose 4.8_% to $ 13.18 billion from $ 12.57 billion a year_earlier . net_income at sears 's merchandise group , which_includes international and credit_card operations , as_well as u.s. stores , fell 25_% . profit at sears 's allstate insurance unit fell 38 % to $ 126.1 million because of hurricane_hugo , which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company 's history . sears said_0 claims from the storm , as expected , reduced its third-quarter_net by $ 80_million , or 23_cents a_share . allstate is_expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth_quarter as claims pour in from the san_francisco earthquake . but a spokesman_said 0 the quake wo_n't have as big a financial impact_on allstate as hurricane_hugo did . net_income at sears 's dean_witter financials services group , meanwhile , rose nearly 32_% to $ 35.7 million , reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and discover credit_card businesses . profit at sears 's coldwell banker real_estate group nearly quadrupled to $ 81.2 million because of gains on sales of property . in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading yesterday , sears shares_closed at $ 40.50 , up_87.5 cents .
