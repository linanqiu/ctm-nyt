fox hunting has_been defined_as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at_least it 's exercise . at_least it has a little dash . most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather_than pleasures . like trying_to buy life_insurance , for_instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash . call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible . but sooner_or later , most of us have to think about life_insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work . and my time has come . i_'m 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one . in times past , life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it . so if anything happened to me , i_'d want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would_be able_to pay_off the mortgage and some other debts -lrb- though not , i admit , enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -rrb- . figuring that maybe $_100,000 to $_150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind_of policy i wanted , i looked_at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish . over the past_decade or two , while i was thinking_about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number_of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . besides term life and whole life -lrb- the old standbys -rrb- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on . what to do ? first , generalize . shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash_value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent_insurance , which_provides not_only a death benefit but also a cash_value in the policy that can_be used in various ways while the insured is still alive . if all 0 you_want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . it 's much cheaper than permanent_insurance bought at the same age . but `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must_be renewed when it expires . it may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if_you flunk -- which means 0 you_need insurance more_than ever -- you may_not be_able to buy it . even_if you_'re healthy and can renew , your premium will_go up sharply because you_'re that much older . so term insurance may_not be as cheap as it looks . there_are all_sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay_off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent_insurance , and many others . one variation that appealed to me at first was the `` money smart term life '' policy offered by amex life_insurance co. , the american_express unit , to the parent_company 's credit-card holders . upon examination , however , i wondered whether the plan made a_lot of sense . amex said_0 it would charge me $ 576 a year for $_100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums 0 i put in if i canceled the policy after 10_years . sounds great -- or does it ? first , if i canceled , i_'d have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration . second , the $ 5,760 0 i_'d get_back would_be much diminished in purchasing power by 10_years of inflation ; amex , not i , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would_have exceeded the inflation_rate and thus given the company a real profit . third and most_important , amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same_amount ; i_'d be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i_'d almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . that would_be all right with amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it_does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me . which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything_else : there_is no free lunch , there_is only marketing . and the second law , unique to insurance ? if i die early , i win -- a hollow victory , since i_ca n't enjoy it -- and if i live long , the insurer wins . always . this is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try_to sell you permanent_insurance , the kind that amasses cash_value . the word `` death '' can_not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk_about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . the implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some_kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature . that is gilding the lily . the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct_investment 0 you might make in the same things 0 the insurance company is putting your money into . that 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion_of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package . again , no free lunch . this is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people_who had the effrontery to die while under its protection . and in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as_well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several_years , largely_because of this . so view permanent_insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct_investment . the simplest , most traditional form of permanent_insurance is the straight whole life policy . you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash_value and dividends grow over the years . one newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -lrb- you pay for the whole policy at once -rrb- , has_been immensely popular in recent_years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash_value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even_though they included gains on investment . congress closed this loophole last_year , or thought_0 it did . however , monarch capital corp. of springfield , mass. , has_developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says_0 does_not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences . but the percentage of your cash reserve that you_can borrow tax-free is very small . i_'m not prepared in any_case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so i look into the broad category called universal life . hugely popular , it is far_more flexible than straight whole life . i can adjust the amount of insurance 0 i want against the amount going into investment ; i can pay more or less_than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and i can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion_of the policy . in looking_at these and other policies , i learn to ask pointed questions_about some of the assumptions built_into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years . they commonly give two scenarios : one is based_on interest_rates that the company guarantees -lrb- usually 4_% to 4.5_% -rrb- and the other on the rate 0 it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5_% or more . projecting the latter over several decades , i find 0 my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high_interest rate prevail for that long ? not likely , i_think 0 . also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some_sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . these are not certain , either . companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize 0 they_'re under_pressure to make their policies look good , ''_says 0 timothy pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at tillinghast , a unit of towers perrin co. , the big new_york consulting_firm . another factor 0 to consider : some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk_bonds , and you_know how nervous the market has_been about those lately . there_are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions_about all of them . at a back-yard barbecue , for_example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her john hancock policy for seven_years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' i call her agent , david dominici . yes , he_says 0 , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can_be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest_rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash 0 to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . if interest_rates plunge , the insurer may_be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments 0 to maintain the same_amount of protection . i_do n't like the sound of that . some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such_as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for 10_years . but glenn daily , a new_york-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed_by the companies . and the feature is so new , he_adds 0 , that no insurer has yet established a track_record for actually making such payments . so-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . offered by insurers that include security-connecticut life_insurance co. , jackson national life_insurance co. , and national travelers life_insurance co. , these policy riders let_me tap a portion_of my death benefits while i_'m still alive . some provisions would let_me collect a percentage of the policy 's face_value to pay for long-term care such_as nursing-home stays ; others would_allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such_as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . but the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face_amount of insurance . also , financial_planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not_yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes . and considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested_in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would_be better_off just buying a separate policy that provides it . i_'m more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even_though it turns_out to be low-load life . insureres selling these policies market them_directly to the public or otherwise do_n't use commissioned salesmen ; there_is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but i figure that the lack_of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a_lot . i compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face_amount from such an insurer , american life_insurance corp. of lincoln , neb. , with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. , which_operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen . after one year i could walk away_from the ameritas policy with $ 792 , but id get only $ 14 from the equitable . the difference is magnified by time , too . at age 65 , when i_'d stop paying premiums , the ameritas offering would_have a projected cash_value $ 14,000 higher_than the other , even_though the equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest_rate . did i buy it ? well , not_yet . i_'m thinking_about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to paris first . a person can_do some heavy thinking_about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
