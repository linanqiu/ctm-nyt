the house joined the senate in making federal reparations for japanese-americans held in world_war ii internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the treasury_department to meet expedited payments of an_estimated $_1.25 billion during the next_several years . the 249-166 roll_call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $ 17.2 billion to the departments of state , justice , and commerce in fiscal_1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government . an_estimated $_40 million would come annually from a new $_20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the justice_department , and securities and exchange_commission filing fees would rise by 25_% to fund a $ 26 million increase in the agency 's budget . yesterday 's vote_on japanese-american reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision , which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988 . `` the only way_0 to reduce the costs is to say_0 we_do n't_want to pay the bill , '' said rep. neal smith -lrb-_d. , iowa -rrb- , who taunted president_bush 's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $_20,000 per individual . `` read my lips , '' said mr._smith . `` if_you 're for paying the claims ... i_do n't_know how anyone can oppose this . '' no payments would_be made this_year , but beginning in fiscal_1991 , the bill commits the government to annual payments of as_much as $_500 million until the total liability of $_1.25 billion is met . the issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the democratic majority . as_much as republicans led the opposition , among the 53 democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the old dixiecrat south and its borders . the odd mix of departments in the underlying_bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle_over the fate of the legal services corp . the measure provides $ 321 million 0 to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed_to by the bush_administration . the conservative bent of the incumbent appointees , named by former_president reagan , has divided republicans . and on back-to-back roll calls , 206-199 and 223-178 , the appropriations_committee leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by sen. warren rudman -lrb-_r. , n.h. -rrb- the estimated $_40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would_be divided_between the justice_department 's antitrust division and the federal trade_commission , which both face serious cuts if the income is n't realized . the federal_bureau of investigation is slated to receive $ 30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil_cases , and the judiciary will rely_on another $_32 million from bankruptcy charges , including a 33_% increase in the current filing fee . the $ 17.2 billion total for the bill does_n't include an_estimated $_1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved_by the house-senate_conference yesterday , and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance . the house agreed_to defer for a year a scheduled 50_% increase in the required state matching_funds for law-enforcement grants but , by a 287-123 margin , the chamber stripped a senate initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states , such_as new_hampshire and delaware , to $_1.6 million from $_500,000 . few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves --_including the three authors of the gramm-rudman-hollings deficit-reduction law . when a house-senate_conference on yesterday 's bill rescinded $ 11.8_million in unexpended funds for a fort_worth , texas , economic_development project backed_by former speaker james wright , sen. phil gramm -lrb-_r. , texas -rrb- insisted last_week that the money be preserved . the measure includes $_2 million secured by mr. rudman for a marine-research project at the university of new_hampshire , and sen. ernest hollings -lrb-_d. , s.c . -rrb- used his power to add $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the commerce_department . this was in_addition to a more parochial $_4.5 million authorization for a health center in south_carolina upheld by a 273-121 vote in the house last_night .
