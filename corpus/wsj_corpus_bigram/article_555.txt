digital_equipment corp. reported a 32_% decline in net_income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal_first quarter , causing some_analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected . although the second-largest computer_maker had prepared wall_street for a poor quarter , analysts said_0 they_were troubled by signs of flat u.s. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders . the maynard , mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying_to reduce_its reliance_on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes . net for the quarter_ended sept._30 fell to $ 150.8 million , or $_1.20 a_share , from $ 223 million , or $ 1.71 a_share , a year_ago . revenue_rose 6.4_% to $ 3.13 billion from $ 2.94 billion . digital said_0 a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong_growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins . a spokesman also said_0 margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector . the lack_of a strong product at the high end of digital 's line was a significant drag_on sales . digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next_tuesday . the new line is aimed directly at international_business machines corp . `` until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo_n't be a_lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said mark steinkrauss , digital 's director of investor relations . he said_0 unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter . dec shares rose $_1.375 to $ 89.75 apiece in consolidated new_york stock_exchange trading_yesterday . but analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the dow_jones industrial_average , that should n't_necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength . some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this_year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead . ``_i think_0 the next_few quarters will_be difficult , '' said steven milunovich of first_boston . `` margins will_remain under_pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , i_'m not sure_0 it will_be a big winner . '' mr. milunovich said_0 he was revising his estimate for dec 's current year from $ 8.20 a_share to `` well_below $ 8 , '' although he has n't settled on a final number . one troubling aspect of dec 's results , analysts said_0 , was its performance in europe . dec said_0 its overseas business , which now accounts for more_than half of sales , improved in the quarter . it even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms . that gain probably translated_into about 5_% to 7_% in dollar terms , well_below recent quarters ' gains of above 20_% , reckons 0 jay stevens of dean_witter reynolds . `` that was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in europe , mr._stevens said_0 . marc schulman , with ubs securities in new_york , dropped his estimate of dec 's full-year net to $ 6.80 a_share from $ 8 . although overall revenues were stronger , mr. schulman said_0 , dec `` drew down its european backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall . `` the bottom_line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has_been before , '' he said . mr. schulman said_0 he_believes that the roll-out of dec 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment colleagues expect 0 . he said_0 current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in december , with all of the more_sophisticated versions out by june . for reasons 0 he would n't_elaborate on , he said_0 he 's sure_0 that schedule wo_n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for dec in the next_few quarters . john_r. wilke contributed_to this_article .
