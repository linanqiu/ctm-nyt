the new_york stock_exchange is_expected to launch its_own program_trading vehicle today , just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up . the big_board this_morning plans to begin trading its exchange stock portfolio `` basket '' product , the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval . esps will_allow institutional_investors to buy or sell all 500_stocks in standard_& poor_'s index in a single trade of a minimum of $_5 million . `` customized '' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available . the securities and exchange_commission gave provisional six-month approval to the big_board basket at a meeting late_yesterday . the sec at the same_time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the chicago_board options_exchange , where the minimum will_be $_1.7 million . also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the midwest stock_exchange . the basket products are `` an evolutionary step '' in solving problems in trading big_blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market_crash , said_0 sec commissioner joseph grundfest . new sec_chairman richard_breeden , overseeing his first public meeting , said_0 there have_been concerns that the big_board 's basket could attract investors with a `` short-term perspective '' who would rapidly turn over the product , thus increasing volatility . but richard ketchum , the sec 's market regulation chief , said_0 he did_n't believe_0 `` this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will_be destabilizing . '' the baskets on the big_board and cboe -- which involve the actual s&p stocks , unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the chicago futures_markets , and index options on the cboe -- will_begin trading as critics step_up their attacks on program_trading and its contributions to the stock_market 's wild price_swings . the big_board argues_that its new product will_help rather_than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program_trading . esps are also an_attempt by the big_board to head_off the exodus of program_trading business to overseas markets such_as london . big_board officials also hope 0 japanese_investors will_become interested_in the exchange 's product . already , many of the big_board 's own floor_traders are warning that the esp baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public . the 400-member alliance of floor_brokers said_0 the new product , with the $_5 million minimum , will benefit only big_institutional investors and could_lead to `` wild spasms of volatility . '' stockbrokers who cater to individual_investors said_0 the big_board 's new product confirms 0 the exchange does_n't want to curtail program_trading , which last_month accounted_for a record 13.8 % of the exchange 's average_daily volume . `` the new_york stock_exchange is losing its cool here , '' said james andrews , head of institutional trading at janney montgomery scott inc. in philadelphia . the new stock baskets `` are going_to make it easier for program_trading to be_done . and it 's going_to be_done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places . '' both the big_board 's exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange 's market basket are designed for institutional_investors . the big_board lists its targets as pension_plans , mutual_fund managers and index-arbitrage traders . in index_arbitrage , program_traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index_futures to profit from small price_discrepancies between the markets . at the same_time , only four securities_firms have signed up with the big_board to buy and sell esps as market_makers , an unenthusiastic response . the market_makers so_far are cs_first boston group 's first_boston corp. unit , morgan_stanley &_co. , painewebber_group inc. and salomon inc. 's salomon_brothers inc. unit . kidder , peabody_& co. , a general_electric co._unit that has_become the biggest program_trader along_with morgan_stanley , is n't a market maker , although the big_board hopes 0 that will change . similarly , the big_board hopes to entice merrill_lynch &_co . neither has plans to be a market maker for now . traders_said 0 major securities_firms are_reluctant to become market_makers because_they fear 0 the baskets may attract only limited trading . big_board officials_say 0 only 25 contracts a day may trade at first , equivalent to a day 's action at a small , regional exchange . even_though the big_board says_0 its product represents a post-crash `` reform , '' some traders suggest_that if the new basket had_been trading during this_month 's friday the 13th market_plunge , the dow_jones industrial_average might_have dropped more_than the 190_points 0 it did . with the futures locked into a trading_halt oct._13 and trading in some individual stock difficult , program_traders would_have undoubtedly fled to the basket system , the traders_say 0 . `` if we had the baskets , we would_be leaving in caskets , '' one_trader said . the sec 's mr._breeden said_0 the after-hours trading on the midwest exchange would help the u.s. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades .
