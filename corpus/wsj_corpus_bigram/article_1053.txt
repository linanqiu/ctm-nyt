a house-senate_conference approved an_estimated $ 67_billion fiscal_1990 spending_bill that provides a 28_% increase for space research and development and incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal_housing administration would_be increased to $ 124,875 . separately , the bill gives authority to the bush_administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners . the second provision , affecting so-called 235 mortgages , has met strong opposition from investment_bankers represented by the public securities association . and a squad of influential former senate aides employed_by the wall_street firm salomon_brothers came to the capitol in a vain attempt_to strip the provision . by an 11-2 margin , senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful allies , the opposition found itself undercut by an_unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives . the government currently is subsidizing an_estimated 23,000 loans above 11_% under the 235 program , and however disruptive to private investors , the refinancing is_expected to yield at_least $ 15 million in savings in fiscal_1990 . this sum has_been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative sen. phil gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests . ``_we are stewards here , not of the mortgage companies , but the taxpayers , '' said the texas republican . the action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $ 9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in nicaragua in february . the bulk of the money would_be funneled through the national endowment for democracy , but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has_been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate destination . the senate had refused late_friday to invoke cloture and limit debate , but behind the bipartisan leadership , a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away_from direct aid to political parties . final_approval -- on a 64-35 roll_call -- was never in doubt , but the opposition drew an_unusual mix of senators , including republicans jesse helms and warren rudman and democrats bill bradley and john glenn . the money will_be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but more_than half is_likely to go to the union nacional opositora party . critics warned 0 such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing , and one irony is that under nicaraguan law a major portion_of the opposition party 's funds must_be shared with the government 's supreme electoral council . within the appropriations conference yesterday , the $ 67_billion measure is the second_largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science , housing , veterans and the environment . the decision to raise the ceiling on fha home loans still faces strong opposition in the house . but it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as_much as $_1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget . these costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal_1991 , and the measure further commits congress to a set of costly projects , including the first construction funds for the space_station . the station is promised $_1.8 billion within the $ 5.36 billion provided for research and development in the national_aeronautics and space_administration , and the nation_'s high-speed aerospace plane -- cut by the senate -- could receive as_much as $ 60 million in new funds or transfers . similarly , the house agreed_to add back $ 62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite , being developed_by general_electric co . and while setting a statutory limit of $_1.6 billion on the automated space_probe , the conference appropriated $ 30 million for the start-up of the craf-cassini mission , a successor to the voyager space_probe . among major domestic agencies , the environmental_protection agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought_by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14_% to about $ 829.9 million . an_estimated $ 1.57 billion is separately allocated for the national science foundation , and within the housing and urban_development department , more_than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families . to an_unusual degree , the massive bill has_become a vehicle 0 for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states . while the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities . the most striking example yesterday may_have been in community_development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued_at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued_at $ 8 million to ostensibly preserve `` balance '' between the house and senate . yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill 0 to emerge_from negotiations this_week , as appropriators approved a fiscal_1990 transportation bill late_monday that includes a sweeping ban_on smoking on most domestic_airline flights . an exemption will_remain for flights longer than six hours to hawaii and alaska , but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate 0 all but about 30 flights would_be covered . separately , a third conference report covering an $ 18.4 billion treasury and postal_service bill was sent to the senate after passing the house on a 383-30 roll_call yesterday . and after weeks of delay , the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape . defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint . and among domestic programs , the most serious threat is white_house opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the district of columbia and department of health and human_services . the same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate , and mr._bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves senate-passed provisions renewing u.s. support for the united_nations fund for population activities . in a sharply written letter , rep. david obey , chairman of the house_appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned mr._bush that the result of his `` ultimatum '' could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere . `` as a result of your ultimatum , '' writes the wisconsin democrat , ``_i guess 0 there_is no_longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend_to veto this bill .
