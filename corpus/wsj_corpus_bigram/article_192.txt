silicon_graphics inc. , a fast-growing maker of computer workstations , said_0 it landed two federal_government contracts worth more_than $_100 million over the next five_years . one award is part_of a department of defense contract to loral rolm mil-spec computers and could_be valued_at more_than $_100 million over five_years . the other involves the sale of about 35 of the company 's high-end workstations to the national_institutes of health . the models , which cost about $ 75,000 each , will_be used in research . the awards are evidence that silicon_graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop_computers , analysts said_0 . `` the company 's on a roll , '' said robert herwick , an_analyst at hambrecht_& quist . `` no other -lcb- computer -rcb- vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . '' in the battle 0 to supply desktop_computers for researchers and design engineers , most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors : sun_microsystems inc. , hewlett-packard_co. and digital_equipment corp. , which make computers mainly aimed_at a wide_range of engineering and scientific needs . silicon_graphics , on the other_hand , has targeted a specific niche since its inception in 1982 , which has_been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing . '' this is a style of `` visual '' computing that provides three-dimensional , color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion . though silicon_graphics is much_smaller than digital , hewlett and sun , it has emerged in recent_years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion_of the workstation market . in_addition , the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop_computers at sharply_lower prices . a year_ago , silicon_graphics introduced a model priced_at $_15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do_n't offer special graphics features . silicon_graphics also plans to unveil even less_expensive machines in the near_future . `` it 's pretty safe to assume 0 we_can bring the cost down of these systems by 30_% to 40_% a year , '' said edward mccracken , the company 's chief_executive officer . silicon_graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off . revenue for its first_quarter ended_sept. 30 was $ 86.4 million , a 95_% increase over the year-ago_period . profit was $ 5.2 million , compared_with $_1 million for the year-ago_quarter .
