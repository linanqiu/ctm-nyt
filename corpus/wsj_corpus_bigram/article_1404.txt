axa-midi assurances of france gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $_4.5 billion acquisition of farmers group_inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates . the proposed_acquisition is part_of sir_james goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover_attempt for b.a.t_industries plc , the british tobacco , retailing , paper and financial_services concern that is parent of los_angeles-based farmers . in an_attempt to appease u.s. regulators ' concern over a goldsmith acquisition of farmers , sir_james in_august agreed_to sell farmers to axa if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t . as_part of the agreement , axa agreed_to invest $_1 billion in hoylake investments ltd. , sir_james 's acquisition vehicle . of the total $ 5.5 billion 0 to be_paid to hoylake by axa , about $_1 billion will come from available resources of axa 's parent , axa-midi group , $_2.25 billion will_be in the form of notes issued by axa , and the remaining $_2.25 billion will_be in long-term bank_loans . in an_interview thursday , claude bebear , chairman and chief_executive officer of axa , said_0 his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led_by cie . financiere_de paribas that they_can provide the loan portion_of the financing . the other banking companies in the group are credit_lyonnais , societe_generale , bankamerica_corp. and citicorp , he said_0 . mr._bebear said_0 axa-midi group has `` more_than $_2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we_can and will sell '' to help pay_off debt from the acquisition . he said_0 the assets 0 to be_sold would_be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real_estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of farmers . ``_we wo_n't put any burden on farmers , '' he said . the amended filings also point_out that under a new agreement , hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell farmers to axa upon an acquisition of b.a.t . ``_we hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate hoylake , and they_can directly look_at the agreement_with us , because hoylake wo_n't be an owner of farmers at anytime , '' mr._bebear said . any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated . the amended filings were required because of the new agreement_between axa and hoylake , and to reflect the extension that sir_james received last_month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed_acquisition . hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -lrb- $ 20.71 billion -rrb- takeover_bid after it received the extension , but said_0 it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of farmers to axa receives regulatory_approval . a spokesman for b.a.t said of the amended filings that , `` it would appear that nothing substantive has_changed . the new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and axa still plans to take out 75_% of farmers_' earnings as dividends to service their debt . '' that dividend is almost double the 35_% currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t , the spokesman added 0 . `` it would_have severe implications for farmers_' policy holders . '' to fend_off sir_james 's advances , b.a.t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial_services concern .
