the u.s._economy grew at a moderate 2.5_% annual_rate in the third_quarter , the same pace as the second_quarter , despite the worst trade performance in six_years , the commerce_department reported 0 . personal spending , buoyed_by a burst of automobile buying , was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion . but trade , one of the economy 's main forces in the past_few years , showed a sharp deterioration . imports of goods and services soared , while exports were_flat . some_economists found the mixture ominous . `` for the past_two years , the foreign trade sector has_been a major contributor to economic_growth . you_ca n't rely now solely on consumer_spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path , '' said norman robertson , chief_economist at mellon bank in pittsburgh . although the economy showed no change of pace from the second_quarter , many analysts_expect it to slow considerably in the fourth_quarter as demand_for autos falls , partly_because of higher_prices on models introduced last_month . many_economists think_0 the rise in the value of the u.s. dollar this_year will further crimp progress in trade , because it makes exports more_expensive and imports cheaper . and business investment -- which slowed in the third_quarter , according_to yesterday 's report -- is_expected to continue to be sluggish . a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross_national product -- the inflation-adjusted market_value of all the goods and services 0 the economy produced . an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an_array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9_% annual_rate in the third_quarter from 5_% in the second . much of the moderation came from declining energy_prices , which have since turned up a_bit , analysts said_0 . consequently , michael darby , undersecretary for economic_affairs at the commerce_department , said_0 inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three_months of 1989 . but he said_0 he_believes 0 the second_quarter 's 5_% rate `` will prove to have_been this_year 's peak quarterly inflation_rate . '' generally , the bush_administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next_month . treasury_secretary nicholas_brady called the 2.5_% pace `` good , solid growth , '' although he said_0 he_expects the expansion to slow in the fourth_quarter . he_added : `` inflation is lower_than i_think 0 people expected it to be , and i_think 0 that 's good_news . '' but administration_officials were concerned over the bleak trade report , which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ 74 billion annual_rate in the third_quarter from a $ 51 billion rate in the second_quarter . mr. darby called it a `` disappointment '' but predicted 0 exports will pick_up again . ``_we were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports , '' said daniel van dyke , vice_president of u.s. forecasting at bank of america in san_francisco . ``_i ca_n't believe_0 it will_continue , '' he_added , noting_that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive . some_analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories . while a buildup of these stocks adds to gnp , it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs . according_to the report , inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual_rate of $ 24.6 billion in the third_quarter , up from a $ 19.5 billion pace in the second_quarter . manufacturers_' stocks fattened at an $ 18.4 billion annual_rate , up from $ 8.3 billion . `` that suggests 0 there_is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected , '' said edward boss , senior financial economist_at continental_bank in chicago . ``_i do_n't think_0 it 's anything that 's going_to cause a downturn in economic_activity . but it will slow production . '' devastation from hurricane_hugo , which slammed into the southeast coast in late_september , diminished personal_income by about $_4 billion , the department said_0 , but it called the effect_on the roughly $_5 trillion economy `` negligible . '' except_for the loss from the hurricane , all the figures were adjusted_for seasonal factors and inflation . here are some of the major components of the gross_national product expressed in seasonally_adjusted annual rates in billions of constant -lrb- 1982 -rrb- dollars : in the third_quarter , the implicit price deflator fell to 2.9_% of the 1982 average , from 4.6_% in the previous_quarter .
