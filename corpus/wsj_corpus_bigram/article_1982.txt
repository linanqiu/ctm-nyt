when the going gets tough , it 's tough to trade stocks in continental europe . that 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money_managers angry at the malfunctions on continental stock_exchanges during last_week 's global market turbulence . they say_0 the recent market_volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way_0 many european exchanges trade stocks . the weaknesses of continental exchanges are driving some fund_managers to switch business to stocks traded on london 's stock_exchange , which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip_issues from 12 major countries . ``_i 'm_not saying_0 london covered itself in glory , but the events of the past_week have certainly exposed europe 's weaknesses , ''_says stewart gilchrist , a director of scottish amicable investment managers in glasgow , scotland , which manages about # 6_billion -lrb- $ 9.63 billion -rrb- in institutional money . he_says 0 the problems on european exchanges included market-system breakdowns , delayed execution of buy and sell_orders and trading suspensions . `` the events strengthen london 's hand in becoming the center for trading european stocks , '' mr. gilchrist says . unable_to unload a large block of a french blue-chip company 's shares in paris for two_days last_week , a frustrated scottish amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called james_capel &_co. , a london brokerage_firm . the firm did the trade in seconds on the london stock_exchange 's seaq automated-quotation system . on so-called manic_monday , oct._16 , stock_prices plunged across_europe and trading problems erupted . london had some problems , too . the london exchange 's electronic price-reporting system provided only indicative , or non-firm , prices for about 40 minutes on manic_monday . some dealers_say 0 other traders were n't picking_up their phones . but london 's problems were nothing compared_with the continent 's . in brussels , which recently spent millions of dollars on a computer-assisted trading system , disgusted traders watched helplessly as a software failure before opening on manic_monday prevented trading for two_days . for 48 hours , no_one had any idea precisely how_much his securities were worth . by wednesday , frustrated belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard . the belgian computer_system finally was repaired and restarted on tuesday of this_week , with the aid of toronto_stock exchange officials who developed the system . in frankfurt , which only has a two-hour daily stock-trading session even in the best of times , stocks did_n't open for the first 45 minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell_orders from small_investors . as banks processed six-foot telexes of sell_orders , the crush led to manic_monday 's worst decline : german stocks ended down 13_% . exchange officials extended trading hours , 75 minutes on monday and 65 minutes on tuesday , to clear up order backlogs . in france , more_than half the top 25 blue-chip_stocks --_including such giants as bsn and elf aquitaine -- did_n't open until wall_street rallied late in the european trading day , traders_say 0 . the rally transformed some big sell_orders into big buy_orders , solving an order-imbalance problem . but by that time , many big institutions had switched business to london . `` belgium was closed for two_days , france closed for a couple of hours , germany was stuck . it was a nightmare , ''_says susan noble , an investment manager at robert fleming holdings_ltd. 's international investment_management unit in london . `` it 's very worrying that these markets ca_n't cope . '' on manic_monday , the volume of german shares_traded in london more_than tripled to 2.2_million , and the volume of french shares rose 48 % . -lrb- by_comparison , german domestic stock volume in frankfurt only doubled that day . -rrb- the switch to the london_market during such turbulent times is significant . for one_thing , the size of the affected market is enormous -- the european stock_markets account for some 22.5 % of global stock_market capitalization , with an_estimated value of $ 2.175 trillion , according_to morgan_stanley capital_international . the continental markets alone contribute about 14.3 % of estimated world market_capitalization of $ 9.671 trillion . though the widely traded shares that are quoted in london account for only a small portion_of those totals , they still are the most closely_watched stocks and are often viewed_as a barometer for the local markets generally . the switch to london underscores the fact_that despite the economic restructuring associated_with european_community efforts to develop a single market by 1992 , european stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity . against this backdrop , one_thing that does_n't seem likely_to result from 1992 is a single european stock_market . rather , there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most european financial centers --_including european giants such_as barclays bank_plc and deutsche_bank , as_well as merrill_lynch &_co. and shearson_lehman hutton_inc. of the u.s. and japan 's nomura_securities co . these firms , which often have acquired a local brokerage_firm , are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to transact a trade . and senior officials of two u.s. securities houses say_0 they switched trades in european stocks to the london_market last_week when they could_n't unwind positions on the continent . meantime , brokers on the continent are worried , too , mostly by the potential loss of business . ``_i would_be much happier if this volume -lcb- in german stocks -rcb- were in frankfurt rather_than london , ''_says dieter bauernfeind , head of international equity sales at dresdner_bank in frankfurt . he acknowledges_that spreads `` were too wide and volumes too light '' in the extreme conditions on manic_monday . already the germans appear to be acting ; at a special_meeting on the day of the decline , directors of the frankfurt stock_exchange voted to extend their trading hours , although they have n't decided when or by how_much . a frankfurt exchange official , acknowledging the brokers ' anxieties , says_0 the market still feels 0 it `` functioned ok during this crash . '' the dutch , who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity , say_0 new equipment 0 to solve the problems ought_to be installed within a month . says a spokeswoman for the brussels bourse : `` nobody around here will tell_you 0 they_are happy 0 the system did_n't work . but it 's just one of those things that happened . investors can_be assured now that this_kind of problem can never occur again . '' but for others , the pledges echo the promises made after the 1987 stock crash , when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last_week . `` they all said_0 they invested huge amounts of money . but they either did_n't buy the right machines or they wasted it , ''_says fleming 's ms. noble .
