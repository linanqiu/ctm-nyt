the supreme_court let stand a new_york court 's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown . the high_court 's action , refusing to hear appeals by several drug companies , is_likely to have a significant impact at several levels . the most immediate effect is in new_york , where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug des -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 des lawsuits pending in that state . the lawsuits stemmed_from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women_who took the drug . on a broader scale , the ruling could encourage other_states ' courts to adopt the logic of the new_york court , not_only in des cases but in other product-related lawsuits , as_well . the new_york court of appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the california supreme_court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it ca_n't be_determined which company is at fault . paul rheingold , a new_york lawyer who_represents des victims , said that before the new_york ruling , only the states of washington and wisconsin had followed the california decision . now that the new_york decision has_been left intact , other_states may follow_suit . `` generally , when new_york and california go one way , it has a tremendous influence on other_states , especially small ones , '' said mr. rheingold . the high_court refused_to hear appeals by rexall drug co. , which went out of business in 1987 and was taken_over by rxdc liquidating trust ; e.r. squibb &_sons inc. , a unit of squibb corp. ; and eli_lilly &_co . the appeals involved des , which was approved_by the food and drug_administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy . in 1971 , the fda banned the use of des after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women_who took the drug . lawsuits over the harm caused_by des have flooded federal and state courts in the past_decade . in many cases , the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there_is no_way 0 to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women . under traditional legal theories , inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed . but in its ruling last_april , the new_york court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose ca_n't be_determined . each company 's share of liability would_be based_on their share of the national des market . the new_york court also upheld a state law , passed in 1986 , extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing des lawsuits . the effect is that lawsuits that might_have been barred because_they were filed too_late could proceed because of the one-year extension . -lrb- rexall drug co. vs. tigue ; e.r. squibb &_sons inc. vs. hymowitz , and eli_lilly &_co. vs. hymowitz -rrb- government contractors the high_court , leaving intact a $_4.25 million damage award against general_dynamics corp. , declined to resolve questions_about a legal defense against civil lawsuits often used by government contractors . last_year , the supreme_court defined when companies , such_as military contractors , may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they_were simply following specifications of a federal_government contract . in that decision , the high_court said_0 a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract , that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment . but last february , a federal_appeals court in new_orleans upheld a damage award against general_dynamics , rejecting the company 's use of the government contractor defense . the appeals_court said_0 the defense is valid only if federal officials did more_than rubber stamp a company 's design or plans and engaged_in a `` substantive review and evaluation '' on a par with a policy decision . general_dynamics appealed to the high_court , backed_by numerous business trade groups , arguing_that the appeals_court definition restricts the defense too severely . general_dynamics was sued by the families of five navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber . the accident was caused_by faulty operation of a valve . a federal_district court awarded damages to the families and the appeals_court affirmed the award . -lrb- general_dynamics corp. vs. trevino court in brief in other action yesterday , the high_court : -- let stand the mail fraud and conspiracy conviction of john lavery , a former vice_president of beech-nut nutrition corp. , a unit of nestle s.a . the conviction stemmed_from federal charges of consumer fraud for sale of phony infant apple juice between 1978 and 1983 . -lrb- lavery vs. u.s. . -rrb- -- left intact an award of $_1.5 million in damages against dow_chemical co. in the death of an oregon man from exposure to agent orange . the award was made by a federal_court to the widow of a u.s. forest service employee who contracted hodgkin 's disease after using herbicides containing agent orange in a weed-killing program .
