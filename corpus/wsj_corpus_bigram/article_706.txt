after slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected u.s. inflation figure , the dollar rebounded later in the trading day . the u.s. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the u.s. consumer_price index . the report showed that september consumer_prices rose just 0.2_% , a smaller increase than expected . the market had anticipated a 0.4_% rise in the price_index . the september index fueled speculation , damaging to the dollar , that the federal_reserve soon will ease monetary_policy further . but foreign-exchange dealers_said 0 the dollar staged a quick comeback , prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying_interest later in the trading day . traders_said that a nearly 40-point gain in the dow_jones industrial_average , fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price_index , had little influence on the dollar 's moves . `` the market is beginning to disassociate itself from wall_street , '' said one new_york trader . in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8470_marks , down from 1.8485 marks_late wednesday , and at 141.70 yen , up from 141.45_yen late_wednesday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.5990 , up from $ 1.5920 late_wednesday . in tokyo friday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen , up from thursday 's tokyo_close of 141.55 yen . some_analysts said_0 the consumer_price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the u.s._economy than earlier indicated . they point_out that september 's producer-price index showed a 0.9_% increase . they noted_that because the consumer_price index , known_as the cpi , is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index , or ppi , it could signal further easing by fed . others suggested , however , that the fed will hold any changes in monetary_policy in check , leaving fed funds at around 8_3\/4 % , down from the 9_% level that prevailed from july through september . kevin logan , chief_economist with the swiss bank corp. , said that both ppi and cpi climbed around 4_1\/2 % year-to-year in_september . he argued_that both cpi and ppi have in fact decelerated since spring . `` the fed wo_n't be stampeded into easing , '' mr. logan said , predicting that for now , interest_rates will stay where they_are . a four-day matched sale-purchase agreement , a move to drain liquidity from the system , was viewed_as a technical move , rather_than an_indication of tightening credit . market_participants note that the mark continues to post heftier gains against its u.s. counterpart than any other major currency , particularly the yen . `` there 's a bottomless pit of dollar demand '' by japanese_investors , said_0 graham beale , managing_director of foreign_exchange at hongkong & shanghai banking corp. in new_york , adding_that purely speculative demand would n't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the japanese currency . mr. beale commented that the mark remains well bid against other currencies as_well . robert white , manager of corporate trading at first_interstate of california , called the market `` psychologically pro-mark , '' noting_that the u.s. remains a `` veritable grab bag '' for japanese_investors which accounts for the unabated demand_for u.s. dollars . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold dropped $ 1.60 to $ 367.10 an_ounce in moderate_trading . estimated_volume was three million_ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong friday , gold was at about $ 366.85 an_ounce .
