control_data corp. , which just months_ago was hemorrhaging financially , thinks_0 it will_be healthy enough soon to consider repurchasing public debt . moreover , the company , whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved fatal , now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls `` the data solutions '' business . ``_i 'm_not saying_0 everything is hunky-dory , but we have completed the transition , '' robert_m. price , chairman and chief_executive , said in an_interview . `` transition '' is a reference to the company 's five-year restructuring effort . during that time , control_data had losses of more_than $_1 billion . now , following asset_sales that shrank revenue by more_than one-third this_year alone , control_data is flush with cash . so its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company 's $ 172.5 million in subordinated convertible_debentures next_year . ``_we 'd_like to continue to reduce debt , '' president lawrence perlman said . noting_that the company is offering to buy_back $ 154.2 million in senior_notes paying 12 3\/4_% , he said_0 the response will_help determine future debt-reduction efforts . the offer was automatically triggered_by the recent sale of control_data 's imprimis disk-drive business to seagate_technology inc . mr. perlman , who is also acting chief_financial officer and the odds-on favorite 0 to become the next chief_executive , said_0 the company is achieving `` modest positive cash_flow from operations , and we_expect that to continue into 1990 . '' he said_0 the company has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines `` for a good part_of 1990 . '' sometime_next year , control_data will `` develop a new bank relationship , '' mr. perlman said . in recent_months a group of lenders , led_by bank of america , has extended control_data up to $ 90 million in revolving loans through january , as_well as $_115 million in standby letters of credit . loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test . last_week control_data reported_third-quarter earnings of $ 9.8 million , or 23_cents a_share , on revenue of $ 763 million . through the first_nine months , the company had a loss of $ 484 million , largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit . while a few assets are still being shopped --_including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion_of the company 's ticketron unit -- mr. price said_0 future restructuring would_be a question of strategy . ``_we do_n't need the cash . '' ticketron 's automated wagering business , which_operates lotteries in a half dozen states , is not for sale , the company said_0 . rather , mr. perlman said_0 , control_data intends_to bid for the coming minnesota lottery contract and is_seeking new applications for the technology overseas , where `` there_is great interest in games of skill . '' he would n't_elaborate . control_data 's semiconductor business , vtc inc. , continues to lose money , the executives acknowledged 0 , but they said_0 they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are_reluctant to dispose of it . the company 's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses -- calls_for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses . partly , costs will_be held down through strategic technology alliances , management said_0 . control_data recently_announced an_agreement with mips computer_systems inc. to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software . james_e. ousley , computer products group president , said_0 such arrangements could help slash control_data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990 . he disclosed that before control_data scrapped its eta systems_inc. supercomputer business this past spring , those costs were running at nearly 35_% of group revenue . at the same_time four of six design projects were spiked , he said_0 . asked how the company hopes to_expand its computer hardware business , mr. ousley said_0 it sees good opportunities in systems integration . ``_we think_0 we_'re getting only 10_% of the integration dollars 0 our_customers are spending , '' he said . ``_we 're in environments that are going_to spend a_lot of money on that . '' control_data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users , such_as the scientific , engineering and academic communities . utilities management is a major commercial niche . reviewing the company 's scrape with disaster , mr. price conceded 0 it had tried_to do too_much on its_own . `` absolutely , '' he said . but while its stock is selling at about_half control_data 's estimated breakup value , neither messrs. perlman nor price said_0 he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile_takeover . ``_we 've_been listed as a candidate for so_long 0 it 's not worth 0 worrying_about , '' said mr. price .
