arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of ual_corp. stock . look_at what_happened to ual 's chairman , stephen m. wolf , and its chief_financial officer , john_c. pope . on a day 0 some united_airlines employees wanted mr._wolf fired and takeover_stock speculators wanted his scalp , messrs. wolf and pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of ual , united 's parent_company , dived $ 24.875 on the big_board to close_at $ 198 . including monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based_on what they would_have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of ual gone through at $_300 a_share . when bank_financing for the buy-out collapsed last_week , so did ual 's stock . even_if the banks resurrect a financing package at $_250 a_share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less_than 0 they stood to gain in the initial transaction . mr._wolf owns 75,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each . in the $_300-a-share buyout , that totaled about $ 76.7 million . by yesterday 's close of trading , it was good for a paltry $ 43.5 million . of course , mr._wolf , 48 years_old , has some savings . he left his last two jobs at republic airlines and flying tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $ 22_million , and ual gave_him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him . his 1988 salary was $ 575,000 , with a $ 575,000 bonus . the 40-year old mr. pope has n't changed jobs enough -- at_least the right ones -- to stash away that kind_of money . united paid him a $ 375,000 bonus to lure him away_from american_airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ 342,122 last_year with a $ 280,000 bonus . mr. pope owns 10,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each . that came to a combined $ 37.7 million under the $_300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close . of the combined $ 114.4 million 0 the two_men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed_to invest in the buy-out just $ 15 million , angering many of the thousands_of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would_be a success . united 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , lifetime access to the friendly skies -- free first-class travel , and $_20,000 a year for life as_well . conceivably , in a scaled-back buy-out , they could_be bumped back to coach seats for life .
