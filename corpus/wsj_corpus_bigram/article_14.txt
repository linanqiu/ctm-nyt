a house-senate_conference approved major portions of a package for more_than $_500 million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily_on $_240 million in credit and loan_guarantees in fiscal_1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment . for the agency for international development , appropriators approved $_200 million in secondary loan_guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan_guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $_40 million over fiscal_1989 as_part of the same poland package . the conference_approved at_least $_55 million in direct cash and development assistance as_well , and though no decision was made , both_sides are committed to adding more_than $_200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought_by the bush_administration . the agreement on poland contrasts_with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the white_house and is sharply confined under this_year 's budget . these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations_bill in conference will_be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern_europe . to accommodate the additional cash assistance , the house_appropriations committee last_week was required to reallocate an_estimated $_140 million from the pentagon . and though the size of the loan_guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in central_america indicates_that it could take several_years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively . the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11_% increase over fiscal_1989 . the house and senate are divided over whether the united_nations population fund will_receive any portion_of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant . in a second area of common concern , the world environment , an_additional $ 15 million will_be provided in development assistance 0 to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global_warming and the plight of the african elephant . the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety_of special interest amendments , running from an_import exemption for a california airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market . panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime , but the central american country would_have received a quota of 30,537 metric_tons over a 21-month period ending sept._30 , 1990 . about a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according_to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of 18_cents a pound runs as_much as a nickel a pound above the world rate . the potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and house majority whip william gray -lrb-_d. , pa . -rrb- began the bidding this_year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to english-speaking countries of the caribbean , such_as jamaica and barbados . rep. jerry lewis , a conservative californian , added a provision of his_own intended_to assist bolivia , and the senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin initiate as_well as the philippines - backed_by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye . jamaica , wary of upsetting its caribbean basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray , but the greater question is whether mr. inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able_to insert a claim by the philippines . in separate floor action , the house waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $_3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law_enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal_1990 . the funding is attached to an_estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking_ban on virtually_all u.s. domestic_airline flights . the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white_house , but in recent_days , the senate has_been as likely_to bounce bills back to the house . the most_recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal_1990 bill funding the state , justice and commerce departments . and after losing a battle tuesday_night with the senate foreign_relations committee , appropriators from both_houses are_expected to be_forced back to conference .
