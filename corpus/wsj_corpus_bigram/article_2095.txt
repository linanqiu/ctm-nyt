marsh_& mclennan cos. said_0 it agreed_to acquire the rest of gradmann & holler , a leading west_german insurance brokerage_firm in which it has held a 15_% stake for 15_years . the transaction , for cash and stock , would represent the biggest european takeover since_1980 for new_york-based marsh_& mclennan , the world 's_largest insurance broker . it 's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the european insurance industry as the european_community commission moves toward a single market by 1992 . protective barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next_summer , when big industrial companies will_be able_to buy insurance from carriers in any other ec country for the first_time . that 's why ``_we have_been working hard to develop a single , more unified presence in europe , '' said_0 a.j.c. smith , marsh_& mclennan 's president , at a london news_conference yesterday . analysts speculated_that marsh_& mclennan would spend between 250_million marks_-lrb- $ 136.4 million -rrb- and 350_million marks for the rest of gradmann & holler , or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm 's estimated earnings . `` this is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world 's leading insurance broker , '' said philip olsen , an_analyst at kitcat & aitken , a u.k. brokerage_firm . earlier_this year , new_york life_insurance co. agreed_to acquire windsor group ltd. , a first_step toward establishing a presence in the european market ahead of 1992 . but most u.s. insurers have n't rushed to change the way_0 they do business in europe because_they believe_0 the european market will still be dominated_by a_handful of domestic companies . under the proposed combination , marsh_& mclennan would gain a majority_stake in gradmann & holler that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85_% . the three managing general partners would_receive a `` significant '' number_of marsh_& mclennan shares , said_0 walther l. kiep , a partner who would also join marsh_& mclennan 's board . mr. kiep said_0 he sought the combination because `` all our large clients in germany are becoming european companies or multinational companies and they_expect an insurance broker '' to serve them as_well in paris as in germany . beatrice e. garcia in philadelphia contributed_to this_article .
