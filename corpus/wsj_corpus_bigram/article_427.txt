growth is good . at_least , that 's a theme emerging among many money_managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains 0 they have already achieved this_year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers . they_are starting to buy growth_stocks . remember them ? the upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early_1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin . that sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate_profits overall have_been weakening from the brisk increases of recent_years . the current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones . those are unwelcome trends in a year that the dow_jones industrial_average has_risen 23_% so_far , even with the 190.58-point_plunge on_oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood . the question for investors is , how to_protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains . that 's the path of reasoning leading to growth_stocks . ``_i think_0 it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , ''_says steven einhorn , partner at goldman_sachs . growth_stocks may_be as big as philip_morris or medium-sized such_as circuit city stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at_least 15_% to 20_% a year , money_managers say_0 . `` the period when growth_stocks should_be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate_profits , ''_says stephen_boesel , president of t._rowe price 's growth and income fund . growth_stocks also are attractive in periods of market_volatility , which many investors and analysts_expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries_to discern where the economy is heading . this_kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds john calverley , senior economist for american_express bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial_average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known_as the `` nifty 50 . '' and they will again , say_0 money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme . cabanne smith , president of a money management company bearing his_name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further . he also thinks_0 foreign_investors , who are showing_signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices . ``_we 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' mr._smith says . mr._smith recommends cypress semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings_growth rate . ronald sloan , executive_vice president of siebel capital_management , likes wellman inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting . mr. sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings_growth rate of 32_% a year over the past_five years . wellman stock closed friday at 39 3\/8 , up 1\/8 ; mr. sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60 . others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth_stocks . carmine grigoli , chief market_strategist for first_boston , who still says , ``_we expect the dow average -lcb- to be at -rcb- 3000 by mid-1990 , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime . he recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as philip_morris , pepsico , cpc international , reebok international , and limited inc . all have a fiveyear earnings_growth rate of more_than 20_% a year . some money_managers are pursuing growth_stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along_with the economic cycle . `` one of the stories of the fourth_quarter is that we will get an_unusual number_of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , ''_says 0 mr. boesel of t._rowe price . james wright , chief investment officer for banc_one asset_management , says , ``_we 've_been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . '' he recently trimmed his portfolio of international_paper , dow_chemical , quantum chemical , international_business machines and digital_equipment . he is putting money in dress barn , circuit city stores , bruno 's , and rubbermaid . big cyclical companies are using `` all the tricks 0 they_can to stabilize earnings , ''_says mr. sloan . he cites ibm , which reported a 30_% earnings decline in the third_quarter , and which last_week announced a $_1 billion buy-back of its shares . `` what they_are telling you is that they do_n't have the ability_to generate higher returns internally , ''_says mr. sloan . `` when they_are buying back stock at 10_times earnings , they_are suggesting_that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock . ibm says_0 it considers its shares a good investment . but not all strategists or money_managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals . growth_stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next_year if the federal_reserve begins to let interest_rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy . goldman_sachs 's mr. einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario . he suggests 0 investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead , as_well as growth issues . friday_'s market_activity stock_prices finished about unchanged friday in quiet expiration trading . traders anticipated a
