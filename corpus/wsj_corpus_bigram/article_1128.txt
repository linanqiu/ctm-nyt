the commodity_futures trading commission plans to restrict dual_trading on commodity_exchanges , a move almost_certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders . the cftc said_0 it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting_from dual_trading and cites `` problems '' associated_with the practice . dual_trading gives an exchange trader the right 0 to trade both for his_own account and for customers . the issue exploded this_year after a federal_bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago_board of trade and chicago_mercantile exchange . while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges , dual_trading became a focus of attempts_to tighten industry regulations . critics contend_that traders were putting buying or selling for their_own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . traders are_likely to oppose such restrictions because dual_trading provides a way_0 to make money in slower markets where there_is a shortage of customer orders . the exchanges contend_that dual_trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do_n't have a customer order in hand . the exchanges say_0 liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such_as those with a long time remaining before expiration . the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . the agency did_n't cite specific situations where dual_trading might_be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are_expected to be among them . wendy gramm , the agency 's chairman , told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be_released within_two weeks and the rule changes to be_completed by thanksgiving . the study , by the cftc 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a member of the study team said . whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis , the member said_0 , `` does_n't seem to have much economic impact . '' currently , most traders on commodity_exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts , which_makes them brokers , or for their_own accounts as socalled locals . `` the tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity 0 they provide to the market , '' mrs. gramm told the senate panel . members of congress have proposed restricting dual_trading in bills 0 to reauthorize cftc operations . the house 's bill would prohibit dual_trading in markets with daily_average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult 0 to track without a sophisticated computer_system . the senate_bill would force the cftc to suspend dual_trading if an exchange ca_n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses . so_far , one test of restricting dual_trading has worked well . the chicago merc banned dual_trading in its standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index futures_pit in 1987 . under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their_own account or for customers . traders who stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed , ca_n't trade for themselves . a merc spokesman_said 0 the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit . `` it 's too_soon to tell ... but people do_n't seem to be unhappy with it , '' he said . he said_0 he would n't_comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal . but at a meeting last_week , tom donovan , the board of trade 's president , told commodity lawyers : `` dual_trading is definitely worth saving . it adds something to the market .
