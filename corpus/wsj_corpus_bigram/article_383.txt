if growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the nasdaq_over-the-counter market could show some flash . some stock_pickers already are targeting the otc_market , where , they say_0 , await plenty_of small - and medium-sized growth_stocks . best of all , they add 0 , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the new_york stock_exchange , are languishing at depressed prices . growth_stocks will return to favor , some_analysts and money_managers think_0 , because of the jitters caused_by the market 's steep slide on_oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing_earnings announcements . against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20_% or so annually have extra appeal . `` the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will_be a return to growth , '' declares mary farrell , a painewebber analyst . among her otc picks are oshkosh b'gosh and a&w brands . like many otc growth issues , they have market values -- as measured_by stock price times shares_outstanding -- of roughly $_100 million to $_500 million . some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long . these are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records . while many growth_stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum . that 's an_important distinction because some_analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks . `` you_can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should_be selective , says_0 john palicka , chief portfolio_manager at midco investors , a newark , n.j. , money management company with about $ 900_million invested in growth_stocks of varying sizes . mr. palicka 's picks from the otc_market include legent , mail boxes etc. , and payco american . the main argument for growth_stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing_economy . `` if the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth_stocks , ''_says l. keith mullins , a growth-stock analyst_at morgan_stanley . eventually , he_believes 0 , investors will_be willing_to pay higher_prices for companies with proven track records of earnings_growth . in_anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their_clients to buy such issues now . understandably , smaller growth_stocks have n't been in favor recently . the average issue on standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index gained 35_% last_year , ms. farrell of painewebber says_0 . smaller-stock earnings , by_comparison , rose between 15_% and 20_% . in_addition , earnings_growth took a back seat to cash_flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year . also , the smaller growth_stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder 0 to buy and sell quickly than blue_chips . as a result , morgan_stanley 's index of 40 emerging_growth stocks -- most of which are in the otc_market -- is up only 13_% for the year , while the dow_jones industrial_average has leaped 24_% and the s&p_500 has_grown 25_% . the nasdaq_composite has gained 23_% this_year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30_% . some investors are_skeptical of growth_stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results . `` people are naturally suspicious of them , ''_says mr. mullins of morgan_stanley . among his favorites in his firm 's index are legent , silicon_graphics and novell . however , more money_managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance . mark schoeppner , portfolio_manager at pittsburgh-based quaker capital_management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based_on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt 0 the company can support .
