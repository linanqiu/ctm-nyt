the bolstered cellular agreement_between bellsouth corp. and lin_broadcasting corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend_off mccaw_cellular communications_inc. , the rival suitor for lin . moreover , the amended pact shows_how mccaw 's persistence has pushed lin and bellsouth into a corner , forcing huge debt on the proposed new company . the debt , estimated at $ 4.7 billion , could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to placate some lin holders in the short_term . the plan still calls_for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin_off its broadcasting operations . but under new terms of the agreement , announced friday , lin holders would_receive a special cash_dividend of $ 42 a_share , representing a payout of about $ 2.23 billion , shortly_before the proposed merger . lin said_0 it_expects to borrow the money 0 to pay the dividend , but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained . under previous terms , holders would_have received a dividend of only $ 20 a_share . in_addition , new_york-based lin would exercise its right to buy out for $_1.9 billion the 55_% equity interest of its partner , metromedia co. , in a new_york cellular franchise . that money also would_have to be borrowed . in effect , mccaw has forced lin 's hand by bidding $_1.9 billion for the stake earlier_this month . ``_we 're taking on more debt than we would_have liked to , '' acknowledged michael plouf , lin 's vice_president and treasurer . although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash_flow would_be sufficient to cover interest_payments on the debt , he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later . analyst estimate the value of the bellsouth proposal at about $_115 to $_125 a_share . they value mccaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a_share . the previous bellsouth pact was valued_at about $ 98 to $_110 a_share . mccaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone_service in the u.s. , already_owns about 9.4 % of lin 's stock . in response to bellsouth 's amended pact , the kirkland , wash. , company extended its_own offer to buy 22_million lin_shares for $_125 apiece , which would_give mccaw a 50.3_% controlling interest . over the weekend , mccaw continued to call for an auction of lin . analysts said_0 they_expect mccaw to escalate the bidding again . `` this game is n't over yet , '' said joel d. gross , a vice_president at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette_securities corp . `` at some point , it will_become non-economical for one company . but i_do n't_think 0 we_'re at that point yet . '' under its revised proposal , atlanta-based bellsouth would_have a 50_% interest in the new cellular company and would_be responsible_for half of its debt . to sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional_investors -- bellsouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company . the provision , described_as `` back-end '' protection , would_require bellsouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might_have to pay . mccaw 's bid also has a similar clause . only mccaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in june 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices . to mollify shareholders concerned_about the long-term value of the company under the bellsouth-lin agreement , bellsouth also agreed_to pay as_much as $ 10 a_share , or $ 540 million , if , after five_years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would_have realized from the mccaw offer . ``_we 're very pleased_with the new deal . we did_n't expect bellsouth to be so responsive , '' said frederick a. moran , president of moran asset_management inc. , which_holds 500,000 lin_shares . bellsouth 's `` back-end protection was flawed previously . we_think 0 this is a superior deal to mccaw 's . we_'re surprised . we did_n't think_0 a sleeping -lcb- bell -rcb- mentality would_be willing_to take on dilution . '' but kenneth leon , a telecommunications analyst_with bear , stearns_& co. , finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company does_n't have to wait five_years to begin buying more lin_shares . `` how_many shares will_be around in 1995 ? '' he asked . `` there 's nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . '' bellsouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings . william o. mccoy , president of the company 's bellsouth enterprises_inc. unit , said_0 the revised agreement_with lin would dilute bellsouth earnings by about 9_% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter . indeed , bellsouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country 0 to become profitable . for 1988 , bellsouth earned_$ 1.7_billion , or $ 3.51 a_share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion . analysts were predicting 1990 bellsouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a_share , or $_1.9 billion , but now those estimates are_being scaled_back . in composite_trading friday on the new_york stock_exchange , bellsouth shares fell 87.5_cents to $ 52.125 . in national_over-the-counter trading , lin_shares soared $ 4.625 to closed_at $ 112.625 , while mccaw fell $_2.50 a_share to $ 37.75 . the proposed bellsouth-lin cellular company , including the newly acquired metromedia stake , would_give the new entity 55_million potential customers , including about 35 million in the nation_'s top_10 markets . mr. leon of bear_stearns speculated_that mccaw , in an_attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust_suit against bellsouth with the justice_department and u.s._district judge harold greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the bell system in 1984 . indeed , mccaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement . urging lin directors to conduct `` a fair auction on a level_playing field , '' mccaw asked how well the public_interest would_be served `` with the bell operating companies controlling over 94 % of all cellular -lcb- potential customers -rcb- in the nation_'s top_10 markets .
