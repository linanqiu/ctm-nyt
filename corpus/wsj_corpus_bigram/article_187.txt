magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles . but even a raft of recent failures is n't stopping them from launching new publications . at the american magazine conference_here , publishers are plenty worried_about the industry 's woes . but they_are also talking_about new magazines . for_example , toronto-based telemedia inc. will publish eating well , a new food and health magazine due out next_summer . new_york-based hearst corp. this_fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 months , a magazine for expectant mothers , and has already launched american_home . and time_warner inc. is developing a spinoff of time_magazine aimed_at kids , on the heels of its successful sports illustrated for kids . over the past_four years , the number_of consumer magazines has increased by an_average of 80 magazines annually , according_to donald kummerfeld , president of the magazine publishers of america . `` this is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said mr. kummerfeld . `` entrepreneurs do_n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry . '' and despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate 0 things may_be turning_around . for the first_nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked_by the publishers information bureau increased 4_% from the same_period last_year , to 125,849 pages . total magazine ad revenue for the same_period increased 12_% to $ 4.6 billion . though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists , the industry in general is doing_well compared_with the newspaper industry . though some magazines are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business . within the same nine_months , news corp. closed_down in fashion , a once-promising young woman 's fashion magazine , drake publications_inc. has folded the long-troubled venture magazine , and lang communications has announced 0 ms. magazine , after 17 years , will no_longer carry advertising as of january . lang is cutting_costs and will attempt_to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue . meanwhile , american health partners , publisher of american health magazine , is deep in debt , and owen lipstein , founder and managing_partner , is being forced to sell the magazine to reader 's digest association inc . mr. lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation_that the sale is in trouble . mr. lipstein said in a telephone_interview from new_york that the sale was proceeding as planned . `` the magazine is strong . it 's simply the right time 0 to do what we are doing , '' mr. lipstein said . `` magazines can no_longer be considered institutions , '' said james autry , president of meredith corp. 's magazine group . `` publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he_added . `` magazines could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . '' there_are also indications that the number_of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling . more_than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are_being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such_as american_express publishing corp. , a unit of american_express co. , and conde nast publications_inc. , a unit of advance publications_inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers . some entrepreneurs are still active , though . gerry ritterman , president of new_york-based network publishing corp. , earlier_this year sold his soap opera digest magazine to rupert_murdoch 's news corp . mr. ritterman said that in the next six_months he will_take $ 50_million from the soap opera digest sale to_acquire new magazines . he would not reveal which magazines he is_considering . `` the magazines 0 i_am looking_for are underdeveloped , '' said mr. ritterman . `` they could_be old or new , but they_are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved . they will_be the next hot magazines .
