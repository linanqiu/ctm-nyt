a permanent smoking_ban on virtually_all domestic_airline routes won approval from the house , which separately sent to president_bush a nearly $ 67_billion fiscal_1990 bill including the first construction funds for the space_station . the smoking prohibition remains attached to a $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that must still overcome budget obstacles in congress . but yesterday 's action put to rest any lingering resistance from tobacco interests . faced_with inevitable defeat , the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote_on the ban , which covers all but a fraction of 1 % of daily flights in the u.s. . the sole exceptions are an_estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in hawaii and alaska . assuming final enactment this_month , the prohibition will_take effect 96 days_later , or in early february . on a 394-21 roll_call , the house adopted the underlying transportation measure . but the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an_estimated $_3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law_enforcement and anti-drug programs . the additional spending pushes the measure more_than $_2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling , and the house_appropriations committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today . the separate $ 67_billion bill sent to the white_house had budget difficulties , too , but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in congress and the administration itself . no single bill this_year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and , apart from the space_station , the measure incorporates far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal_housing administration is increased to $ 124,875 during fiscal_1990 . and in_anticipation of increased lending , the cap on fha loan_guarantees would rise to approximately_$ 73.8 billion . separately , the bill gives authority to the department of housing and urban_development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income families . this provision met early and strong resistance from investment_bankers worried_about disruptions in their_clients ' portfolios . but the promise of at_least $ 15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between hud_secretary jack_kemp and lawmakers wanting to_protect their projects elsewhere . the estimated $_1.8 billion for the space_station would_be double last_year 's level , and total appropriations for the national_aeronautics and space_administration would grow 16_% to nearly $ 12.4 billion . a string of costly projects , including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite , would_continue to be developed within these limits . and while imposing a statutory cap of $_1.6 billion on future spending , the bill would_give nasa $ 30 million for the start-up of the craf-cassini mission , a successor to the voyager space_probe . separately , the national science foundation is promised a 7.7 %_increase to bring its appropriations to $ 2.07 billion . and while pursuing these initiatives , congress and the white_house are squeezed too by steady increases -- $ 551 million -- in veteran 's medical_care . the result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs , and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal_1991 . senior members of the house_budget committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills , yet admit that much of the disorder now stems_from the fiscal legerdemain associated_with their_own summit agreement_with the white_house this past spring . `` it 's hard to get the administration 's attention on anything , '' said rep. bill frenzel -lrb-_r. , minn. -rrb- , `` because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry . '' among the subsidies continued in the transportation bill is $ 30.7 million 0 to maintain commercial air service for an_estimated 92 communities , often in rural areas . senate_appropriations committee_chairman robert byrd -lrb-_d. , w.va . -rrb- strongly resisted deeper cuts sought_by the house . but at a time when the white_house wants to kill the entire program , republicans have_been among its leading champions . sen. pete domenici -lrb-_r. , n.m. -rrb- , the ranking republican on the senate budget_committee , used his influence to preserve more_than $ 132,000 in subsidies for air service to sante fe , n.m. , and more_than $_2.1 million would go for service to eight communities in the western nebraska district of gop rep. virginia smith on the house_appropriations committee . gp express , an_independent airline serving much of nebraska , estimates that nearly 40_% of its revenues come from the subsidies that , in some_cases , exceed the cost of a ticket . for_example , a passenger can fly from chardon , neb. , to denver for as little as $ 89 to $ 109 , according_to prices quoted by the company . but given the few number_of users , the cost to the federal_government per passenger is estimated at $ 193 , according_to house and senate_appropriations committees . the house action yesterday came as the senate remained mired in difficulties over a $ 17.25 billion measure covering the budgets for the state , commerce , and justice departments in fiscal_1990 . the compromise bill passed the house last_week but has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the senate foreign_relations committee , which jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the state_department . the same jealousy can breed confusion , however , in the absence of any authorization bill this_year . house and senate appropriators sought to establish a nov._30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed . but on a 53-45 roll_call this provision was stripped from the bill last_night after foreign_relations chairman claiborne pell -lrb-_d. , r.i . -rrb- complained_that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more_than three decades .
