at the ritzy fashion island shopping center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy southern_california beach community disembark from their mercedes-benzes and bmws for another day of exercising their credit_cards . they root among the designer offerings at neiman-marcus and bullocks wilshire . they stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the atrium court . they graze at the farmers market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies . `` the beautiful look of wool , '' croons the show 's narrator , `` slightly victorian in its influence ... . '' meanwhile , in the squat office_buildings that ring fashion island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced . law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here . `` they seem to like these industrial parks , ''_says kacy mcclelland , a postal inspector who_specializes in mail fraud . ``_we call them fraud farms . '' welcome to that welter of contradictions known_as newport_beach . this city of more_than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . it is also known_as the fraud capital of the u.s. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` cote de fraud '' . how does a community famous for its high living end_up as a haven for low-lifes ? clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter . the places renowned for breeding bunco , like the miami neighborhood known_as the `` maggot mile '' and las_vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high_rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine . you_do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in green bay or buffalo . con men hate snow . newport_beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly . what more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for ? nothing seems hard here . the breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily . nightlife is plentiful . moreover , ostentation is appreciated . the median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more_than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation_'s largest pleasure-boat harbor . `` blondes , cocaine and corvettes , '' mutters mr. mcclelland . `` that 's what they_'re after . '' the rich image of newport_beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . `` one_reason 0 they use newport_beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , ''_says david katz , a u.s._attorney who , until_recently , headed a multi-agency southern_california fraud task_force . `` newport_beach is known in rhode island for having a_lot of rich people . '' no wonder 0 all_kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . but above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish . because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows_how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest . ``_i 've heard that there_is $_40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler_rooms every year , '' mr. mcclelland says . `` if that 's true , orange_county has to be at_least 10_% of that . '' and most of the truly big scams in orange_county seem to originate in newport_beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the california coast south of los_angeles . in fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` newport_beach '' operations . that contrasts_with the penny-ante sales of things such_as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known_as `` hollywood '' scams . newport_beach telemarketers concentrate_on precious_metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands_of dollars a shot . the investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals . in one ingenious recent example of a newport_beach boiler room , prospective investors in capital trust inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious_metals was insured against losses `` caused_by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according_to an indictment handed up by a federal_grand jury in los_angeles last_month . thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the newport_beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges 0 . douglas jones , an_attorney representing richard o. kelly sr. , the chairman and president of capital trust , says_0 his_client denies that there was any attempt_to defraud investors . `` there_were some business deals that went bad , '' mr. jones says , `` but no intent to defraud . '' newport_beach operations differ from the hollywood boiler_rooms in style as_well as in dollars . traditionally , boiler_rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices . indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room . but , says_0 mr. katz , the u.s._attorney , `` the interesting thing about newport_beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings . when we go there , it 's quite different from these hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' the newport_beach operators also tend_to indulge themselves privately . investigators cite the case of matthew valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at lompoc federal prison for his role in intech investment corp. , which promised investors returns of as_much as 625 % on precious_metals . mr. valentine , who pleaded_guilty to five counts of fraud in federal_court in los_angeles , drove a leased mercedes and lived in an expensive home on lido isle , an island in newport 's harbor , according_to investigators . with the $_3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive bmw for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . `` it 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in las_vegas , '' mr. katz says . all this talk of boiler_rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element . vincent m ciavarella , regional manager of property management systems , insists 0 he does_n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6_million square_feet of office_space around fashion island that his company leases for irvine co. , the owner and developer of the project . mr. ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges_that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable . '' -lrb- investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler_rooms often leave without paying rent . -rrb- richard luehrs , president of the newport harbor area chamber of commerce , calls boiler_rooms a `` negative 0 we wish 0 we could_get rid of . '' actually , ``_we do_n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists 0 , `` except_for the press who write about it .
