it can_be hoped that spanish prime_minister felipe gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory sunday . a strong challenge from the far left , the communist coalition izquierda unida , failed to topple him . he should_consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic_reforms and not a demand that he move further left . if he follows the correct path , he may_be able_to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition . the far left had some good issues even_if it did_not have good programs for dealing_with them . it could point to plenty_of ailments that the spanish economic rejuvenation so_far has failed to cure . unemployment still is officially recorded at 16.5 % , the highest rate in europe , although actual joblessness may_be lower . housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition . large pockets of poverty still exist . the left also is critical of the style of the socialist government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in britain . mr._gonzalez and his_colleagues , particularly the finance_minister , carlos solchaga , are charged_with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television -lrb- controlled_by the state -rrb- to face their accusers . in response to this , the socialist prime_minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments . they_are very considerable : since_1986 , when spain joined the european_community , its gross_domestic product has_grown at an annual average of 4.6_% -- the fastest in the ec . in that time more_than 1.2_million jobs have_been created and the official jobless rate has_been pushed below 17_% from 21_% . a 14_% inflation_rate dropped below 5_% . net foreign_investment through august this_year has_been running at a pace of $ 12.5 billion , about double the year-earlier rate . mr._gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming spain 's nato commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the u.s. . mr._gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary , however . he did_not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes . yet the best 0 the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40_% -- from endorsing the direction 0 spain is taking . now he can_go further . he should do more to reduce tax_rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact_that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues . he could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six_years . the voters delivered mr._gonzalez a third mandate for his successes . they , as_well as numerous latin_american and east european_countries that hope to adopt elements of the spanish model , are supporting the direction 0 spain is taking . it would_be sad for mr._gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes .
