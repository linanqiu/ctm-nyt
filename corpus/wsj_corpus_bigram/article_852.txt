program_traders were buying and selling at full steam monday , the first trading_session after the stock_market 's 190.58-point_plunge friday . they accounted_for a hefty 16_% of new_york stock_exchange volume monday , the fourth busiest session ever . on friday , 13_% of volume_was in computer-guided program_trades . in_august , by_contrast , program_trading averaged 10.3 % of daily big_board turnover . program_traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash oct._19 , 1987 , and a number_of brokerage_firms pulled_back from using this strategy for a while . but as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988 , they resumed . some observers thought that after friday_'s sharp_drop , the firms would rein in their program_traders to_avoid stoking more controversy . but the statistics released_yesterday show 0 the firms did nothing of the sort . one_reason , they said_0 , was that the official reports on the 1987_crash exonerated program_trading as a cause . stock-index_arbitrage is the most_controversial form of program_trading because it accelerates market moves , if not actually causing them . in it , traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index_futures contracts to profit from fleeting price_discrepancies . under the exchange 's definitions , program_trading also describes a number_of other strategies that , in the opinion of some traders , do_n't cause big swings in the market . the big_board 's disclosure of program_trading activity on these two_days was unusual . though it collects such data daily , its monthly reports on program_trading usually come_out about three_weeks after each month ends . the september figures_are due to be_released this_week . the big_board declined to name the wall_street firms involved in the activity friday and monday , or the type of strategies used . but traders on the exchange floor , who can observe the computer-guided trading_activity on monitor screens , said_0 most of the top program-trading firms were active both days . through august , the top five program_trading firms in volume were morgan_stanley &_co. , kidder , peabody_& co. , merrill_lynch &_co. , painewebber_group inc. and salomon_brothers inc . though brokerage officials defended their use of program_trading , one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment_on the record . besides reciting the pardon for program_trading contained in the brady commission report , they said_0 stock-index_arbitrage was actually needed monday to restore the markets ' equilibrium . on friday , the stock-index_futures market was unhinged from the stock_market when the chicago_mercantile exchange halted trading in standard_& poor_'s 500_futures contract -- a `` circuit_breaker '' procedure instituted after the 1987_crash and implemented for the first_time . futures_trading resumed a half-hour later , but the session ended shortly thereafter , leaving the stock_market set_up for more sell_programs , traders_said 0 . by monday_morning , they said_0 , stock-index_arbitrage sell_programs helped re-establish the link_between stocks and futures . but stunning volatility was produced in the process . the dow_jones industrial_average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading monday as stock-index_arbitrage sell_programs kicked in . at about 10:10 a.m._edt , the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index_arbitrage buy programs . by day 's end , the dow_industrials had rebounded 88.12 points , or nearly_half of friday_'s drop .
