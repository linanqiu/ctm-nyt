well , the arrogant east_coast media have spoken again -lrb- `` going for the green , '' editorial , oct._17 -rrb- . having resided in the great state of california for the past seven_years , i find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when i start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when i try_to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when i hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing . perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists , suggesting_that their save-the-earth initiatives are `` whacky '' and referring_to so_many citizens as `` la-la activists . '' strange that we_do n't hear similar criticisms of the east_coast activists who seek to clean_up boston harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste . while there_are no easy low-cost solutions , simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state , the nation and the world . if nothing else , such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action . before your next california-bashing editorial , please spend_more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view . john barry ventura , calif . i realize 0 you were just looking_for something snotty 0 to say about california and its environmental movement , but picking frank lloyd wright to say it for you was a bad call . wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among `` la-la activists . '' indeed , wright said all his life that the greatest lessons 0 he learned were derived from the study of nature . obviously , it 's lost on you that about 75_% of the american people these_days -lrb- and in fact the president of the united_states -rrb- consider themselves environmentalists . as for california being a state run by liberal environmental loonies , let 's not forget where ronald_reagan came from . perhaps mr. reagan , who claimed that air pollution is caused_by trees , is the man 0 you should_be quoting to back up your position that economics is more_important than the earth . but it was frank lloyd wright who said , `` is this not anti-christ ? the moloch that knows no god but more ? '' robert borden santa_monica , calif . your_editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor , `` alar : scaring on the side of caution . '' the illogic and inaccuracy of john_h. adams 's comments for the national resources_defense council fully justifies your characterization of california 's greens in particular as `` la-la activists . '' we may all hope that california 's voters will heed the scientific realities that their_own university 's renowned prof. tom jukes provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their `` wealthy hollywood weepers . '' i have a different approach 0 to offer , not_only to californians , but to all americans . in a free country , the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent_with good manners and public safety . would-be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law . w. brown morton jr . warsaw , va . the 170 airlines in the international air_transport association last_year posted group net profit of $_2.5 billion on revenue of $ 125.1 billion . according_to the association 's annual report , scheduled to be_released today in warsaw , iata members have n't posted such a strong performance since the late_1970s . revenue last_year increased by more_than 11_% over 1988 , and net_income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier_net of $ 900_million . the group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate , rising demand_for air travel and improved average_yield -lrb- revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer -rrb- . systemwide , iata airlines carried 632 million passengers last_year , 2_% more_than in 1987 . but passenger-kilometers , the distance flown while carrying people , increased 5.3_% in 1988 . the association said that lack_of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry . the kgb has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents , the government newspaper izvestia said_0 . the newspaper quoted kgb chairman vladimir a. kryuchkov as saying_0 the definition of anti-soviet crimes had narrowed , the laws had changed and people no_longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue . mr. kryuchkov was_quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th directorate a new unit would work `` to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country . '' czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of `` massive buying out of food '' by tourists from poland , hungary and the soviet_union , the rude pravo daily said_0 . rising inflation in poland and hungary makes czechoslovak food , clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these_countries . the paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said_0 the measures were necessary to_protect the domestic market . west_germany 's_biggest union , ig_metall , said_0 it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation_'s automotive , steel and engineering industries . its chairman told the union to prepare_for the worst in next_year 's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal . a major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37 . last_week came news of alarm in venice over a plan to tap gas fields off the city 's coast . now comes word from a scientist that over the next century venice will sink nearly three_times faster_than the present rate because of the `` greenhouse_effect . '' `` global_warming means higher tides which will lower venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years , '' giovanni cecconi of the the new venice consortium said . the consortium of scientists and companies was set_up by italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals . venice has sunk 10 inches in this century . west_germany 's quelle said_0 it will establish a mail-order operation with two local partners in the soviet_union next_year . saying_0 this is a first for a western company , west_germany 's_largest mail-order group said_0 the newly established moscow-based intermoda company is_scheduled to begin operations in february 1990 . intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the quelle catalog , translated_into russian , to soviet customers who have access to convertible currency . the european_community commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of south_korean small-screen color-television sets . saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged ec producers ' profits and led to job losses , the commission imposed a duty of 10.2 % on tvs made by daewoo , a duty of 12.3 % on goldstar co. , 13_% on samsung and 19.6 % on tvs made by other south_korean producers . the commission said that ec television producers lost `` important market shares '' and suffered an `` unsustainable '' pressure_on prices because of the korean companies_' marketing and pricing policies , which it said_0 were `` in clear violation '' of international_trade rules . in other news concerning south_korea 's television industry , samsung signed an_agreement with soyuz , the external-trade organization of the soviet_union , to swap korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the soviet_union . south_korea and the soviet_union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier_this year . sri lanka , where more_than 15,000 people have died in six_years of ethnic turmoil , said_0 it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next_year . `` many programs 0 we have now come from the west and are not suitable to our culture , '' a government minister said . a star attraction on the national network is the u.s. 's `` dynasty . '' ... a poll of south koreans showed overwhelming opposition to efforts to curb dog-meat consumption just because it offends foreigners .
