the scene opens with pinstripe-suited executives -- easterners , obviously -- glued to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur-driven limousines . `` the carpetbaggers , '' snorts the narrator with a texas twang , `` have packed their bags and went . '' but , he continues 0 , `` they_'re forgetting 0 we_'re all texans . the lone_star is on the rise again . '' as the music swells , viewers discover 0 they_'re watching a commercial for lone_star beer , the pride of texas , a product of g. heileman brewing_co. , a la crosse , wis. , unit of bond corp . as the ad 's tone implies , the texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these_days , and lone_star is n't alone in trying_to take_advantage of that . from chevy trucks to lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks , the state has_been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating texans and castigating outsiders . while advertisers have long appealed to texans ' state pride and prejudices , the latest trend has_been sparked , in part , by the state 's recent hard economic times . that has_taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that texas is the only state that was once a nation , but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders . in the past , writes 0 houston chronicle columnist jim barlow , outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests 0 to prove 0 they had the `` right '' texas attitudes and `` of course they had to be dipped for parasites . '' there_is no small irony in the fact_that some of the most-jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of -- you guessed it -- outsiders . lone_star 's bond_corp. parent , for_instance , hails from perth , australia . north carolinians , new yorkers , californians , chicagoans and ohioans own texas banks . all_kinds of landmark texas real_estate has_been snapped_up by out-of-staters . even the beloved dallas cowboys were bought by an arkansas oil man . `` texas has lost its distinctiveness , leaving texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves , ''_says stephen klineberg , a sociology professor_at rice university , houston . `` this plays right into the hands of the advertising_agencies . '' for_example , the iced-tea radio campaign for thomas j. lipton co. , an englewood cliffs , n.j. , unit of anglo-dutch unilever group , emphatically proclaims : `` real texans do not wear dock-siders -- ever . real texans do_n't play paddleball , at_least i hope not . this is football country . and another thing -- real texans drink lipton iced tea . '' in developing that theme at interpublic_group of cos . ' lintas : new_york unit , account supervisor lisa buksbaum says_0 she made a `` couple of phone_calls '' to dallas ad friends and reported her `` findings '' to a team of writers . her findings ? `` you_know , '' she_says , `` stereotypical stuff like armadillos , cowboys and football . '' not exactly sophisticated market research , but who cares as long as the campaigns work . and ad_agencies insist_that they do . stan richards of richards group_inc. , dallas , tells of the texan who saw the agency 's tear-jerking commercial for first gibraltar bank f.s.b. -- complete with the state 's anthem -- and promptly invested $_100,000 in the thrift 's cds . never mind that first gibraltar is one of the failed texas thrifts taken_over by outsiders -- in this case , an_investor group headed_by new_york financier ronald perelman . the north texas chevy dealers recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad_campaign that thumbs its nose at elite easterners . and deposits at ncnb_texas national_bank , a unit of ncnb_corp. , charlotte , n.c. , have increased $_2 billion since last_year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to texas . ``_obviously , pride sells in texas , ''_says a spokeswoman for bozell inc. , omaha , neb. , which_represents the ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company 's ` texasness , ' pointing_out the competition 's lack thereof , or trying_to be more texan than texans . ford trucks may outsell chevy trucks in places like `` connecticut and long island , '' sniffs 0 a commercial for chevrolet , a division of general_motors corp . the commercial , created_by bateman , bryan & galles inc. , of dallas , adds derisively : ``_i bet 0 it takes a real tough truck to haul your ivy_league buddies to the yacht club . '' because_they want a truck that is `` texas tough , '' the commercial concludes 0 , `` texans drive chevy . '' j.c._penney co. , which relocated from new_york to suburban dallas two_years ago , gently wraps itself in texas pride through a full-page magazine ad : `` taking the long-range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is part_of the lone_star lifestyle , '' the ad reads . `` it 's part_of our style , too . '' according_to several ad-agency sources , newcomers to the texas banking market are spending a combined $ 50_million this_year to woo texans . meanwhile , surviving texas banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who truly care about the state . the most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the independent bankers_association of texas , although it 's hard to tell from previews of the $_5 million `` the i 's of texas '' tv campaign . commercials will highlight heart-rending scenes of texas and chest-swelling , ain't-it-great-to-be-a-texan music . supporting banks will sign a `` texas declaration of independents . '' but in introductory material for the campaign , the trade_group urges members to `` arm '' for a `` revolution '' against big , out-of-state bank-holding companies . a video sent to association members , featuring shots of the alamo , cowboys , fajitas and a statue of sam houston , does_n't mince words . `` texans can sniff a phony a mile away , '' the narrator warns outsiders . `` so , do_n't come and try_to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat . '' young_& rubicam 's pact young_& rubicam , fighting charges that it bribed jamaican officials to win the jamaica tourist_board ad account in 1981 , said_0 it will no_longer create the tourist_board 's advertising . in a statement , alex kroll , young_& rubicam 's chairman , said `` under the present circumstances -lcb- we -rcb- have agreed that it is prudent to discontinue that contract . '' young_& rubicam has pleaded innocent to the charges . the board would n't_comment on its impending search_for a new ad_agency 0 to handle its estimated $_5 million to $_6 million account . ad_notes ... . new account : sunshine biscuits inc. , woodbridge , n.j. , awarded its estimated $_5 million account to waring & larosa , new_york . the account had_been at della_femina mcnamee wcrs , new_york . media policy : macnamara clapp & klein , a small new_york shop , is asking magazine ad representatives to tell it when major advertising inserts will run in their publications . it says_0 it may pull its clients_' ads from those magazines . coke ads : coca-cola_co. said_0 it produced a new version of its 1971 ``_i 'd_like to teach the world to sing '' commercial . the ad is part_of classic coke 's 1990 ad_campaign , with the tag line , `` ca_n't beat the real thing .
