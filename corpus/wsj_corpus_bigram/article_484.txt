a labor-management_group is preparing a revised buy-out_bid for united_airlines parent_ual corp. that would transfer majority_ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according_to people_familiar with the group . the group has_been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $_225 to $_240 a_share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . but to_avoid the risk of rejection , the group does_n't plan to submit the plan formally at a ual_board meeting today . instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try_to test the board 's reaction . people_familiar with the company say_0 the board is n't likely_to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $_300-a-share , $_6.79 billion buy-out_bid that collapsed last_week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , british_airways plc , dropped out . in composite_trading friday on the new_york stock_exchange , ual closed_at $ 168.50 a_share , down $ 21.625 . but the pilots union , which has_been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised_bid to_avoid further loss of momentum even_though it has n't found a partner 0 to replace british_air . although the bidding group has n't had time 0 to develop its latest idea fully or to_discuss it with banks , it believes_0 bank_financing could_be obtained . after the collapse of the last effort , the group does_n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount 0 to be borrowed . under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be_used to finance a cash payment to current holders . those current holders would also receive minority_interests in the new company . for_example , the group could offer $_200 a_share in cash plus stock valued_at $ 30 a_share . ual currently has 22.6 million_shares , fully_diluted . the new structure would_be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special_dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest . the difference is that current holders would n't retain majority_ownership or control . the failed takeover would_have given ual employees 75_% voting control of the nation_'s second-largest airline , with management getting 10_% control and british_air 15_% . it was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more_than 50_% . management 's total could_be reduced , and the public could_get more_than the 15_% control that had_been earmarked for british_air . one option 0 the board is_likely to consider today is some_sort of cooling-off period . although the pilots are_expected to continue to_pursue the bid , ual chairman_stephen wolf may_be asked to withdraw_from the buy-out_effort , at_least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can_be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of ual_stock is held by takeover_stock speculators who favor a sale . the labor-management_buy-out group plans to_keep its offer on the table in an_apparent attempt_to maintain its bargaining position with the board . however , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , los_angeles investor_marvin davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4_billion bid in early august , is hanging back -- apparently to_avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . three top advisers to mr._davis visited new_york late_last week , at_least in part to confer with executives at citicorp . mr._davis had paid $_6 million for citicorp 's backing of his last bid . but citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank_loans for the labor-management_group . on friday , british_air issued a statement saying_0 it `` does_not intend_to participate_in any new deal for the acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future . '' however , several people said that british_air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from british regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the ual_buy-out . also late_last week , ual flight_attendants agreed_to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . but the machinists_union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out_bid , is_likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor . one advantage 0 the buy-out_group intends_to press with the board is that pilots have agreed_to make $_200 million in annual cost concessions to help_finance a bid . speculation has also arisen that the ual executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank_financing , chief_financial officer john pope , may come under_pressure to resign . however , people_familiar with the buy-out_group said_0 mr. pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time . despite the buy-out_group 's failure to_obtain financing , ual remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment_banking and legal_fees to the group 's advisers , lazard_freres &_co. , salomon_brothers inc. , and paul weiss rifkind wharton & garrison .
