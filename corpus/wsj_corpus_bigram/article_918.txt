the lethal shudders that wracked the san_francisco bay_area -- rated a 6.9 on the richter_scale -- did_n't match the great earthquake of 1906 , rated at 8.25 . the difference of just 1.35 points on the scale , designed by charles richter of caltech in the 1930s , means 0 the older quake was `` 10 to 20 times stronger , ''_says lane johnson , director of the university of california berkeley seismographic station . the ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the san_andreas fault on tuesday , mr._johnson added 0 . in 1906 , the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide . though the epicenter of tuesday 's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of santa_cruz , and 50 miles south of san_francisco , its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion . but the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill , as were the marina_district of san_francisco and the bay_bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation . `` landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when_you shake it , '' said douglas segar , professor of geosciences at san_francisco state_university in a televised interview . `` it liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern . our quake behaved much like the mexico city earthquake , where great damage was miles from the epicenter . '' mr._johnson , of the berkeley seismographic station , said : `` landfill can_be done if it 's properly compacted . you_can drive piles on it and build on it . '' he cited the example of san_francisco 's financial_district , where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed . but the public policy issues raised by earthquake_damage will_be difficult 0 to address , mr._johnson predicted 0 . `` the attention span of the public is short , '' he said . ``_we 've known for years and years 0 we_'ve got lots of old -lcb- pre-1950s -rcb- unreinforced brick and masonry buildings . '' one old building , the golden state bank building on front street , had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake , leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air , while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars . reinforcing such old building stock , mr._johnson said_0 , `` comes down to money . it 's a danger . we_know 0 it 's there . and sooner_or later , we have to do_something about it . '' the urgency is heightened because this_week 's earthquake -- while major and followed_by hundreds_of aftershocks -- did_n't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon . `` the big one is still due , '' mr._johnson predicted in an_interview . `` the bay_area has three very dangerous faults , the san_andreas , the hayward fault and the calaveras fault . it -lcb- tuesday 's quake -rcb- has n't solved our problem . in california , this is the reality .
