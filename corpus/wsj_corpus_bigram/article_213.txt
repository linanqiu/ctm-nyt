some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal_antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent_years . the funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is_expected to be signed by president_bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the justice_department and the federal trade_commission . as a part_of overall efforts to reduce spending , congress cut by $ 30 million the bush_administration 's_request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal_1990 , which began oct._1 . to offset the reduction , congress approved a $_20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time 0 they make required filings to antitrust_regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions . some democrats , led_by rep. jack brooks -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because_they fear that the fees may_not fully make up for the budget cuts . but justice_department and ftc officials said_0 they_expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them . `` it could operate to augment our budget , '' james rill , the justice_department 's antitrust chief , said in an_interview . under measures approved_by both_houses of congress , the administration 's_request for $ 47 million for the antitrust division would_be cut $ 15 million . the ftc budget request of $_70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million . the administration had requested roughly the same_amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal_1990 as was appropriated in fiscal_1989 . the offsetting fees would_apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act . under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued_at $ 15 million or more must notify ftc and justice_department antitrust_regulators before completing the transactions . currently , the government charges nothing for such filings . proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based_on recent filing levels of more_than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at_least $_40 million this fiscal_year , or $ 10 million more_than the budget cuts . `` when_you do that , there_is not a cut , but there_is in fact a program increase of $_5 million '' each for the ftc and the justice_department , rep. neal smith -lrb-_d. , iowa -rrb- said_0 during house debate . but rep. don edwards -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected . the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice_department were cut more_than 40_% in the reagan_administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period . `` today is not the time 0 to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has_fallen , '' mr. edwards argued 0 . any money in excess of $_40 million collected from the fees in fiscal_1990 would go to the treasury at large . corporate lawyers said_0 the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions . though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take_effect , government_officials said_0 they had n't noticed any surge in filings .
