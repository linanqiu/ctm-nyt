this has_been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron curtain and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow . it has also been a week when inside-the-beltway washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-president reagan 's multimillion-dollar junket in japan . the latter may seem oddly irrelevant , if not downright trivial , given the big picture and the way_0 we have handled it in the nation_'s capital has done nothing to dispel that impression . in fact , however , mr. reagan 's casual debasement of the office 0 he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do_something . our ability_to influence the outcome of events in eastern_europe and the soviet_union is far_more marginal . those events continue to move at a rate , and in a direction , which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake . earlier_this week , soviet foreign_minister eduard a. shevardnadze confessed that the u.s.s.r. ignored universal human values by invading afghanistan and , to put it bluntly , `` engaged_in a violation of the abm_treaty '' by building its radar station at krasnoyarsk . hungary is no_longer a `` socialist peoples '' republic , the communist_party no_longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon_krenz was not backed unanimously by his_fellow party functionaries when he took_over as east_germany 's new maximum leader . all of that is just for starters , or so the hundreds_of thousands_of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding . of like , though lesser , note , secretary of state james_baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost , and therefore behind mikhail_gorbachev , in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past_week or so . and , last but not least , president george_bush now views the changes in eastern_europe as `` absolutely extraordinary '' and believes that mr._krenz `` ca_n't turn the clock back '' in east_germany because the change is too inexorable , '' as he told the new_york times 's r.w. apple jr . -lrb- in other_words , after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences , the administration has come down on the side of those_who believe_that what we are witnessing from berlin to siberia is a good_thing 0 to be welcomed , rather_than a new thing 0 to be feared or viewed with suspicion . -rrb- all of this is what history will note , assuming that events do_n't make it seem a bad joke , when the record of this time is put down . for journalists , however , who write what they fondly view as history 's first draft , this has also been a week 0 to give a_lot of space and time to ron and nancy 's sales appearance in japan on_behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder . it has_been a well-paid transaction , this bartering away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office . the japanese industrialist has coughed up at_least $_2 million , the japanese government has put_up just about as_much , or so it is reported and at_least one estimate puts the total tab at $ 7 million . all of which has enabled those of us in washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go_into high public dudgeon , as mr. apple and i did the other night on abc 's `` nightline . '' punching away , we raised what i still think_0 were all the right issues and landed more_than one hard blow , but at the end of the affair , there was just the tiniest nagging worry_that we had_been aiming at the wrong target . as one of his defenders so aptly put it , president_reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election -lrb- and some would say thereafter as_well -rrb- . he was performing for pay , and why_should anyone expect anything more ? primarily_because there 's more to the matter than ronald_reagan 's personal values , or lack_of them . selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so_much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards . the theme song for the 1980s has_been , `` anything goes , '' and it has_been whistled with gusto from wall_street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism . there_are those_who say that this is nothing new , that america has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced . there_is evidence 0 to support that view . eighty-three years_ago , william james wrote to h.g. wells : `` the moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success ... that , with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success , is our national disease . '' but if it was the national disease in 1906 , it is today the national commonplace . if there_is no law against it , do it . if the law leaves loopholes , use them . if there_is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it , full speed ahead . and if_you are caught or if people complain , simply argue_that `` everyone does it '' or `` no_one said_0 i should n't '' and brazen it out . as a last recourse , when all else has failed and you are pinned , apologize for having disappointed those_who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong . -lrb- see , for_instance , jim bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this tuesday for defrauding the faithful . -rrb- consider the troubling dissonance between mr._shevardnadze 's speech of confession this_week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair . the soviet foreign_minister publicly concedes that his government `` violated norms of behavior '' in afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station . we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra , and that apparently is n't going_to change . for that matter , those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press . that is the key to the current `` national disease . '' no_one seems willing_to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher_than the narrowest construction of the law . the occasional media witch hunt about some politician 's private peccadilloes notwithstanding , the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain , `` who am i to judge ? '' thus , no standards , no judgment and no values . `` you are mad because he 's making so_much money , '' say president_reagan 's defenders . no , we ought_to be mad because he has demeaned the office 0 we gave_him , enlisting it in the service of private gain , just as we ought_to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth , play disingenuous games about their activities or , to steal a phrase , make public_service a private trough . ``_i 'm_not going_to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this , president_bush told mr. apple in this_week 's interview . he was referring_to the `` absolutely extraordinary '' events in eastern_europe , and it is a defensible position . but there_is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s . we did_n't stampede into it , we slithered and slipped down the long slope , and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former_president huckstering for a foreign poohbah . or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the united_states of 1989 : everything for sale ; nothing of real value . mr. carter is a political commentator who_heads a television production firm .
