columbia_savings &_loan association , reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond_market , announced a loss for the third_quarter of $ 226.3 million , or $ 11.57 a_share . for the quarter a year_ago , columbia reported_earnings of $ 16.3 million , or 37 cents_a share . total_assets increased to $ 12.7 billion in the latest_quarter from $ 12.4 billion a year_earlier . the loss stems_from $ 357.5 million of write-downs on columbia 's $ 4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio , which_includes about $ 3.7 billion of junk_bonds , $_400 million of preferred_stock , and treasury_securities . columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent_years to its junk-bond portfolio , the largest of any u.s. thrift . much of columbia 's junk-bond trading has_been done through the high-yield department of its beverly_hills neighbor , drexel_burnham lambert_inc . for the nine_months , losses totaled_$ 212 million , or $ 10.83 a_share , compared_with net_income of $ 48.7 million , or $_1.11 a_share , a year_earlier . the results_include a $ 130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market_value . columbia also added $ 227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio , increasing general reserves to $_300 million , or about 6.7_% of the total portfolio , as of sept._30 . on june_30 , loss reserves stood_at $ 108.3 million . thrift officials said_0 the $_300 million reserve will_be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market_conditions . the adjustments result from the recently passed thrift-industry bailout_legislation , which requires thrifts to divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994 . previously , columbia did_n't have to adjust the book_value of its junk-bond_holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments . because columbia now must sell the bonds within five_years , accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices . for its future strategy , columbia officials said_0 the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments , as_well as beefing up more traditional thrift activities . the quarterly results also reflected $ 21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial_real-estate activities in california . thomas spiegel , columbia 's chairman , said in a statement that the thrift was `` disappointed '' by the effects of the accounting changes . but he said_0 columbia remains `` one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry , '' based_on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital . columbia announced the results after the close of the stock_market . its shares_closed at $ 5.125 each in composite new_york stock_exchange trading , down_37.5 cents . the price of columbia shares has_been cut nearly in half since august , when they traded at about $ 10 , as investors apparently realized that the thrift would_be forced to take a big write-down . the stock 's decline accelerated in the past_two weeks , from a price of $ 8 a_share on_oct. 9 . columbia officials said_0 they do_n't know_how quickly they will dispose of the thrift 's junk_bonds , because federal regulations , such_as those that would_allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries , have n't_yet been completed . columbia officials also said_0 the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital_requirements , despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should_be in place by year 's end . its ratio of tangible equity to total_assets as of sept._30 was 3.6_% , and total equity was $ 457.9 million . the thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in_connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged_buy-outs , which has a book_value of $ 90 million . although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed , columbia said_0 the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $_200 million to $_300 million . columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more_than $_70 million . david b. hilder in new_york contributed_to this_article .
