high-definition_television promises to be the tv of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market . although major u.s. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to japan , not_everyone here is ready to give up . a_handful of small u.s. companies are struggling to develop the technology 0 to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are_expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . with only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying_to compete_with the goliaths of the japanese consumer_electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the japanese government . photonics technology inc. of northwood , ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a tv display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . planar systems_inc. of beaverton , ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual_revenue , has similar plans . it already_has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition_television . two other firms , ovonic imaging systems_inc. of troy , mich. , and magnascreen corp. of pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays . the new technologies are intended_to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set . replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition_television , or hdtv , which is_expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade . large u.s. companies are interested_in other segments of the hdtv business , such_as signal-processing and broadcast equipment . but except_for zenith electronics corp. and international_business machines_corp. , which is collaborating with toshiba on computer displays , they_are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels . general_electric co. recently sold_off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to thompson-csf of france . ``_we found the market not developing as we thought_0 it would , '' a ge spokesman says . the small u.s. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . `` no_one yet has_shown the ability_to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says_0 zvi yaniv , the president of ovonic imaging . he_says 0 he_thinks 0 his company is just a few_years from doing that . the bush_administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in hdtv should_be , is n't doing much for now . the only material support 0 it is extending to the struggling u.s. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency . the darpa funds are a pittance compared_with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending . the commerce_department estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over $_1 billion . `` unless it gets more help , the u.s. industry wo_n't have a chance , ''_says peter friedman , photonics 's executive_vice president . thus far , almost_all of the basic technology relating to high-definition_television has come from u.s. laboratories . but peter brody , magnascreen 's president , says_0 japanese_companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they_did with earlier u.s. innovations in color television and video recording . in the 1970s , mr. brody helped develop the first display panels based_on active-matrix liquid crystals at westinghouse_electric corp. 's research labs in pittsburgh . the panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image . in 1979 , however , westinghouse abandoned the project along_with its stake_in advanced television . mr. brody left the company to find other backers . he has a claim to the right to commercialize the westinghouse patents , but he_contends that those patents are_being infringed by a number_of japanese producers . `` most american investors have just given up , '' mr. brody says . `` they_are n't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter . '' many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . ``_we do_n't see a domestic source for some of our -lcb- hdtv -rcb- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , ''_says michael kelly , director of darpa 's defense manufacturing office . so darpa is trying_to keep the industry interested_in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . hdtv already_has some military applications , such_as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders . the navy is ordering displays for its aegis cruisers and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks . the commerce_department also is trying_to encourage hdtv because of the benefits that could spin_off to the semiconductor and computer industries . `` it is n't just yuppie television , '' argues jack clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation . `` the industry will create industrial products such_as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . '' although some hdtv advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such_as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would_prefer more darpa funds . each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a_bit more money to make it commercial . they also want u.s._trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce_department 's concern over their future . they all are strongly_opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers , including matsushita , hitachi , and toshiba , to exempt portable color tvs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the u.s. imposes on the larger japanese color tvs . and they_want the u.s. to help them sell overseas . planar president james hurd says_0 he has to pay tariffs as high as 15_% to sell his display panels in japan and south_korea , while panels from those countries enter the u.s. duty-free . `` this is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he_says . ``_we just have n't learned what it takes to compete .
