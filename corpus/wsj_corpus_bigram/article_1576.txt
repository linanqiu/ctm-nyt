federal and state thrift examiners said_0 they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of lincoln_savings &_loan association , and a california regulator described an attempted `` whitewash '' by deputies of chief federal regulator danny wall . in a riveting day of hearings before the house_banking committee , the examiners described finding shredded documents , a mysterious panamanian subsidiary , millions of dollars funneled into a swiss bank , and a complacent attitude by mr. wall 's deputies , one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator . a california official also said_0 he sent the federal_bureau of investigation a packet of documents relating to a previously_reported $_400,000 contribution from lincoln 's parent solicited by sen. alan_cranston -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- . federal examiner alex barabolak said_0 lincoln 's operations amounted_to `` pyramiding debt to provide a luxurious life_style for its owners . '' another federal examiner , john meek , said_0 lincoln 's principal owner , charles keating jr. , and his family drew off at_least $ 34 million from the thrift in salaries , bonuses and proceeds_from securities sales in the 3_1\/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier_this year . lincoln 's collapse may cost taxpayers as_much as $_2.5 billion , according_to estimates , making it the most expensive thrift failure in history . ``_i think_0 there 's overwhelming evidence 0 to indicate probable criminal activity , '' said mr. meek , who_participated last_year in an examination of the irvine , calif. , thrift . he said_0 the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by mr._keating `` and others , '' although he did_n't allege any specific violation . richard newsom , a california state official who last_year examined lincoln 's parent , american_continental corp. , said_0 he also saw evidence that crimes had_been committed . `` it sure smells like it , '' he said . he said_0 30_% of the loans 0 he sampled were `` dead meat on the day 0 they_were made . '' the state examiner also said_0 supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant_to demand write-downs of lincoln 's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious . `` later on , my concerns_about a whitewash became even more serious , '' he said . he called the sour loans `` appalling '' and added , `` you opened the file up and it just jumped at you . '' leonard bickwit , a washington attorney for lincoln 's parent corporation , said in an_interview , ``_we deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers . '' `` those_who testified -lcb- yesterday -rcb- have consistently maintained that anyone_who did_n't agree with them is part_of a coverup , a whitewash , or the subject of excessive influence , '' mr. bickwit said . ``_we simply do_n't agree with that or the findings of their investigation . '' mr. wall 's deputies complained_that they had n't been given an_opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the banking_committee 's hearings , which committee_chairman henry gonzalez -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- has used as a forum to flay mr. wall 's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside_from his job . `` a couple of things 0 mr. newsom said were at_least misleading , '' said kevin o'connell , one of the washington regulators responsible_for the handling of lincoln . in an_interview , he said_0 federal_regulators eventually declared one of the loans 0 the state regulator cited to be a total loss , and forced lincoln to make an $ 18 million downward adjustment on another . `` our response to the whitewash would simply be , 0 look what_happened , '' another washington official , alvin smuzynski , said in an_interview . federal officials seized the association in april , a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law_proceedings . the government later brought a $_1.1 billion fraud suit_against mr._keating and others . rep. gonzalez has complained_that regulators waited far too_long , however , ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place lincoln into receivership two_years before it failed . `` he took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence , '' rep. gonzalez said . state thrift examiner eugene stelzer said_0 he found the chief federal examiner steve scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions . `` frankly , it was like he worked for the lincoln public-relations department , '' mr. stelzer testified . and david riley , a federal examiner who_worked under mr. scott , said_0 he found his chief oddly upbeat about lincoln . asked to comment , a spokesman for mr. scott said : `` mr. scott has spoken to his attorney , who has advised him not to talk to anybody . '' mr. meek said that a day or two before lincoln 's parent entered bankruptcy_proceedings , he and other examiners saw `` a truck with a sign on it that said_0 it was from the ` document destruction center . ' we observed at_least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck . '' mr. bickwit said_0 the paper had_been donated to `` a charitable organization that sells it for recycling . they shredded it simply because it contained financial information_about their creditors and depositors . '' mr. meek said_0 his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by lincoln , including $ 22_million paid to credit_suisse of switzerland , an $ 18 million interest in saudi european bank in paris , a $ 17.5 million investment in a bahamas trading company , and a recently discovered holding in a panama-based company , southbrook holdings . mr. bickwit said , ``_i can see why an s&l examiner would regard these as unusual activities , '' but said_0 the overseas investments `` essentially broke even '' for the s&l .
