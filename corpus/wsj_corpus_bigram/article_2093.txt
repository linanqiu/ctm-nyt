there_are two versions of `` measure for measure '' on stage at the alley theater here . one is a strong , vigorous portrayal of shakespeare 's play ; the other is director gregory boyd 's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old vienna . `` measure for measure '' is one of shakespeare 's `` problem '' plays , so named because it_does not fit neatly into a category such_as tragedy , comedy or history . its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no_doubt one_reason why it is very_much in vogue with directors just now . last season , hartford stage director mark lamos mounted a production at lincoln center , and currently two other productions -- one just closed_at the old globe in san_diego and another now at the seattle rep -- overlap with mr._boyd 's . in the play , the duke of vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical angelo , hoping 0 he can set things right . when angelo hears that the young man claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her , angelo summarily condemns claudio to death . when , however , claudio 's sister , isabella , a novitiate in a convent , goes to angelo to plead her brother 's case , the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and , in a supreme act of hypocrisy , demands that isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life . meanwhile , the duke , who set the original scheme in motion , appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the duke arranges a last_minute reprieve for all concerned . for the alley production , scene designer peter david gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience . when the action requires , a prison cell , consisting_of an enlarged wire cage , rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform . in the play 's major scenes mr._boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the shakespearean dynamic . when isabella -lrb- ellen lauren -rrb- confronts her brother claudio -lrb- matt loney -rrb- in his cell , explaining the price 0 she has_been asked to secure his freedom ; when isabella and the disguised duke -lrb- philip kerr -rrb- conspire to trick angelo ; and when mariana -lrb- annalee jefferies -rrb- , a woman wronged by angelo , confronts him with his past misdeeds , the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence . at such moments mr._boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity 0 to be a superior interpreter of shakespeare . when , however , he decides to be modern , or more accurately , when he decides to be trendy , the results are far_less satisfactory . mr._boyd is of the directorial school that believes_0 one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences . it 's a valid approach , but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste . in his `` measure , '' mr._boyd has `` modernized '' the pimps and prostitutes of vienna whom angelo is supposed_to bring under control by converting them into transvestites , punk rockers and heavy metal types , with a strong emphasis_on leather , chains and porno-inspired costumes . loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes , even those in the convent . when claudio is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except_for the manacles on his wrists and ankles . when the opportunist lucio -lrb- jack stehlin -rrb- visits the convent to inform isabella of her brother 's fate , lucio not_only slaps the mother superior on her rear , but brings along a voluptuous companion -lrb- jill powell -rrb- , not in shakespeare 's script , 0 to undulate lasciviously . meanwhile , the pimp pompey -lrb- glen allen pruett -rrb- , dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece , indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts 0 to launch a space_probe . the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack_of discrimination . the inclusion at one_point , for_example , of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors , ranging_from jim bakker and leona helmsley to zsa zsa gabor , is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of mr._boyd 's ability . despite the excesses , however , the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses . what 's more , it represents an_important step for the alley theater . `` measure for measure '' is mr._boyd 's first directorial assignment as the theater 's new artistic director . he succeeded pat brown , who was fired by the alley board 18_months ago . her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter zeisler , head of theatre communications group , to write an editorial in american theatre magazine condemning the board . none of this backlash could change the fact_that ms. brown 's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative . now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts . not_only is mr._boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage , the balance_sheet is the best 0 the theater has had in 10_years . as opposed to the $_1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season , the 1988-89 year concluded with a $_200,000 surplus and a $_500,000 cash reserve . admittedly last season 's runaway hit , `` steel magnolias , '' helped a_lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board . only time will tell if mr._boyd can restore to the alley the acclaim 0 it received when its founder , nina vance , was at the height of her powers . but it is clear 0 he is going_to give it a shot .
