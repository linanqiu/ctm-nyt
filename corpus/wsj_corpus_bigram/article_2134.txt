this_year is the 75th anniversary of the federal_reserve system , and some members of congress think_0 it 's time 0 to take a fresh look_at the nation_'s central_bank . after 75 years there may_be a few things that are worth reexamining . the regional federal_reserve bank setup , for_instance , may_be out of date . in earlier years it may_have seemed reasonable to give richmond , va. , a bank and allow los_angeles only a branch of the san_francisco bank , but times have changed . maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism ; the fed , after all , is a national central_bank . some of the would-be reformers , however , want to restore an arrangement 0 we once had -- or , at_least , part_of it . in the beginning , the treasury_secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the federal_reserve board . but in 1935 , when congress was trying_to find someone or something 0 to blame for the great_depression , it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board . carter glass , a former treasury_secretary who was then back in congress , probably influenced the decision . he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great_deal of power and , somehow , he did_n't think_0 that was a good_thing . times have changed . rep. byron dorgan -lrb-_d. , n.d . -rrb- has introduced a bill in congress , co-sponsored by rep. lee hamilton -lrb-_d. , ind. -rrb- , that would put the treasury_secretary back on the board . there_is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at_least congress , as in 1935 , would_be doing something . so_far no_one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board . nicholas_brady , the incumbent treasury_secretary , is of course aware of the proposal , and he does_n't like it much . mr. dorgen has_changed tactics , dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea . that may_have pleased the secretary , but h. erich heinemann , chief_economist of the investment firm of ladenburg , thalmann &_co. , suggests_that mr._brady may figure 0 he already_has all the power 0 he needs . like most treasury secretaries , mr._brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters , of course . he was , in fact , taking an especially keen interest in board matters even_before he went to the treasury . after the october_1987 market_crash , mr._brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried_to decide_what went wrong and what should_be done about it . one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency , probably the federal_reserve , should coordinate regulation of all financial_markets . this recommendation might_have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try_to expand his power , but so_far federal_reserve chairman_alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job . the fed has plenty_of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well . mr._brady has said_0 he thought_0 government_agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions , but he has left no_doubt that he still likes the ideas 0 the commission advanced nearly two_years ago . in recent_weeks , moreover , mr._brady has joined other administration_officials in trying_to urge the fed toward lower_interest rates . the urging admittedly has_been gentle . in an_interview with the washington_post in early_october , the secretary said_0 the fed may_be slightly_more interested_in curbing inflation than the administration is , while the administration may put slightly_more emphasis_on spurring economic_growth . at_least some_economists , of course , would argue_that inflation deserves a_lot of emphasis . earlier_this month the st._louis fed held a conference to assess the system 's first 75 years . allan meltzer , a carnegie-mellon university economist , noted_that the fed 's record included the longest , most sustained , peacetime inflation in our history , dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989 . the inflation-growth argument is an old one , but mr._brady , on the board or off , is surely trying_to influence fed policy . equally importantly , the treasury_secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping avidly for west_german marks and japanese yen . the treasury can_do something on its_own , but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed . the central_bank has_been helping , but apparently not especially eagerly . the fed has_been intervening in foreign_currency markets , all right , but through august , at_least , it appeared to be `` sterilizing '' the intervention . in other_words , it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market . now , sterilized intervention may_have some effect . when traders see 0 the fed is in the exchange market it may make_them tread a little carefully , for fear of what the central_bank may do . but it 's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact_on currency values . after august the fed may_have stopped sterilizing , but it 's hard to see much impact_on the dollar . the dollar is still highly volatile . the fed has let interest_rates slip slightly , but whether the main_reason was dollar intervention , the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment , or the friday 13 market drop , only mr._greenspan and his associates know . earlier_this year , martin feldstein , president of the national bureau of economic research , argued forcefully that a government that wants steady , stable exchange_rates might try some steady stable economic_policies . trying_to manage exchange_rates to some desired level , he said_0 , `` would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation . '' the more we_think about it , the more we suspect 0 mr._brady does indeed have enough power where he already is .
