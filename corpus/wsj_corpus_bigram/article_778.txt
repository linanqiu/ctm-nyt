abortion-rights advocates won last_week 's battles , but the war over the nation_'s most-contentious social question is about to pick_up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions . strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state house in pennsylvania next_week , with easy approval by the senate and by democratic gov. bob casey expected shortly thereafter . legislation 0 to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will_probably pass both_houses of the michigan legislature and set_up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of democratic gov. james blanchard . the short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are_likely to govern the debate in the next_several months : the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude , and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its_own elsewhere . the action in pennsylvania , for_example , will follow last_week 's collapse of a special session of the florida legislature 0 to enact restrictions_on abortions in that state , and the vote here in washington by the house to permit federally paid abortions for poor_women who are victims of rape or incest . but president_bush is_expected to veto the congressional_legislation and that , along_with the easy approval of the pennsylvania measure , is_likely to mute the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement . `` it 's great to feel good for once in 15_years , ''_says harrison hickman , a consultant to abortion-rights advocates , reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last_week 's victories , the first major events since the supreme_court , in its july 3 webster decision , permitted the states to enact restrictions_on abortions . `` but how_many more times we_'re going_to feel good in the next 15 is another question . '' indeed , abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests . `` the pro-choice movement has_shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize , ''_says glen halva-neubauer , a furman university political scientist who_specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question . `` but it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like pennsylvania or missouri , where abortion has_been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time . '' the foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in pennsylvania , where abortion-rights activists are so_much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does_n't reflect the viewpoints of the state 's citizens . as a result , gop state rep. stephen freind of delaware county , the legislature 's leading foe of abortion , has_been given all but free rein 0 to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and , he hopes 0 , to force the supreme_court directly to reassess its 1973 roe v. wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place . the freind legislation -- the state 's house judiciary_committee approved it in harrisburg this_week and the full pennsylvania house is_expected to take up the bill next_tuesday -- includes a provision 0 to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy , except to avert the death of the mother . mr. freind calculates that the provision , which attacks the trimester standards that roe established , will `` make it necessary '' for the supreme_court to review roe and , perhaps , to overturn it . but the pennsylvania measure also_includes an `` informed consent '' provision that may become widely imitated by abortion foes who_want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves . under this legislation , a woman must_be informed 24_hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks . `` regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion , '' mr. freind argues , `` it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made_available to her before she makes a decision which , one way or the other , might remain with her for the rest of her life . '' in michigan , where the state senate is_expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next_week , gov. blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists . susan rogin , a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state , takes comfort from the fact_that the state 's house abortion opponents `` have n't been_able to muster the votes 0 to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years . '' but proponents believe_0 they may_be able_to shake enough_votes loose to override the veto if_they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights . in illinois , lawmakers will vote before next_spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age , weight and lung maturity along_with a provision requiring that , if fetuses survive an abortion , a second doctor must_be on hand to help it survive . the legislation failed by one vote to clear the house rules committee tuesday , but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this_fall . pamela sutherland , executive_director of the illinois planned parenthood council , says_0 she and her allies are `` cautiously optimistic '' 0 they_can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote . abortion foes in wisconsin , meanwhile , expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early_november and are hopeful of prevailing in both_houses by next_march . in texas , abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along_with a statewide ban_on the use of public funds , personnel and facilities for abortion , and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older . the anti-abortionists are urging gop gov. bill clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run nov. 14 to dec. 13 . `` the prognosis is only fair , ''_says kathie roberts , administrative director of the texas right to life committee . `` next_year is an election year and the legislators just do_n't want to do_anything about this now . '' this legislative activity comes as both_sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts , plunging into gubernatorial races in virginia and new_jersey , and girding for next autumn 's state elections . at the same_time , abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy , deciding to move on what jacki ragan , the national right to life committee 's director of state organizational development , calls `` reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of americans support . '' these_include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection , and the public funding of alternatives for abortion . `` those_who are on the other_side can hardly oppose alternative funding if_they continue to insist on calling themselves ` pro-choice ' rather_than ` pro-abortion , ' ''_says mary spaulding , the group 's associate state legislative coordinator . over the weekend , the national abortion rights action league singled_out eight politicians , including pennsylvania 's mr. freind , as 1990 targets and held a washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques , including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures . ``_we now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first_time , ''_says kate michelman , executive_director of the group .
