many of the nation_'s highest-ranking executives saluted friday_'s market_plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players . assuming that the market does_n't head into a bottomless free_fall , some executives think_0 friday_'s action could_prove a harbinger of good_news -- as a sign that the leveraged_buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent_years may_be abating . `` this is a reaction to artificial lbo valuations , rather_than to any fundamentals , '' said john young , chairman of hewlett-packard_co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 . `` if we get_rid of a_lot of that nonsense , it will_be a big plus . '' a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council , a group that meets to_discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism . `` people wish 0 the government would do_something about leveraged_buy-outs , do_something about takeovers , do_something about donald_trump , '' said rand araskog , chairman of itt_corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 . `` where 's the leadership ? where 's the guy_who can say : 0 ` enough is enough ' '' ? the executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even_though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes . ``_i 'm_not going_to worry_about one day 's decline , '' said kenneth olsen , digital_equipment corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close_at $ 86.50 . ``_i did_n't bother calling anybody ; i did_n't even turn on tv . '' `` there has n't been any fundamental_change in the economy , '' added john smale , whose procter_& gamble_co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close_at $ 120.75 . `` the fact_that this happened two_years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo_n't be a problem . '' of course , established corporate managements often tend_to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists . indeed , one chief_executive who was downright delighted by friday_'s events was robert crandall , chairman of amr_corp. , the parent of american_airlines and the target of a takeover_offer by mr._trump . asked_whether friday_'s action could help him avoid being trumped by the new_york real_estate magnate , mr. crandall smiled broadly and said : `` no comment . '' on friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business_leaders issued a report predicting 0 the economy would grow at roughly an_inflation-adjusted 2_% annual_rate , through next_year , then accelerate anew in 1991 . of the 19 economists who_worked on the business council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation_'s output over the next two_years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said_0 lewis preston , chairman of j.p._morgan &_co. and vice_chairman of the business council .
