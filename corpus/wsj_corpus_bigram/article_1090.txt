two leading constitutional-law experts said_0 president_bush does_n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item_veto . professors philip kurland of the university of chicago and laurence tribe of harvard law_school said_0 any effort by president_bush 0 to claim authority for a line-item_veto would contradict the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors , as_well as the views of previous presidents . a line-item_veto is a procedure that would_allow a president to veto part_of a big congressional spending_bill without_having to scuttle the entire measure . mr._bush has said_0 he would like to be_able to use this procedure . a white_house spokesman_said last_week that the president is_considering declaring that the constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item_veto to provoke a test_case . but the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by sen._edward kennedy_-lrb- d. , mass._-rrb- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item_veto . '' the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- mr. kurland is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal . the two professors said_0 the constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . moreover , they said_0 the first appropriations_bill passed 200 years_ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item_veto . they also said that more_than a dozen presidents have called for line-item_veto authority since the civil_war , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation 0 to give the president line-item_veto power , but that it would_be a `` reckless course of action '' for president_bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
