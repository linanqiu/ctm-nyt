raymond chandler , in a 1950 letter defending a weak hemingway book , likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher . when the champ has lost his stuff , the great mystery novelist wrote 0 , `` when he can no_longer throw the high hard one , he throws his heart instead . he throws something . he does_n't just walk off the mound and weep . '' chandler might_have been predicting the course of his_own career . his last published novel featuring private detective philip marlowe , the inferior `` playback '' -lrb- 1958 -rrb- , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work . when he died in 1959 , chandler left_behind four chapters of yet_another marlowe book , `` the poodle springs story , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque . `` champ '' chandler 's last pitch , apparently , was a screwball . now robert parker , author of several best sellers featuring spenser , a contemporary private eye in the marlowe mold , has with the blessings of the chandler estate been hired to complete `` the poodle springs story . '' the result , `` poodle springs '' -lrb- putnam 's , 288 pages , $_18.95 -rrb- is an entertaining , easy 0 to read and fairly graceful extension of the marlowe chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and california color . if it_does not quite have chandler 's special magic -- well , at the end , neither did chandler . as the book begins , a newly wed marlowe roars into the desert resort of poodle -lrb- a.k.a . palm -rrb- springs at the wheel of a cadillac fleetwood . his bride is the rich and beautiful linda loring , a character who also appeared in chandler 's `` the long goodbye '' and `` playback . '' philip and linda move into her mansion and ca_n't keep their hands off each_other , even in front of the hawaiian\/japanese houseman . but the lovebirds have a conflict . he_wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she_wants him to live off the million dollars 0 she 's settled on him . that 's chandler 's setup . mr. parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving poodle springs high life , hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds . the supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by bernie ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous chandler books who still does_n't hesitate to have marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . the style throughout bears a strong resemblance to chandler 's prose at its most pared down . all told , mr. parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might_have had a right to expect . but there_are grounds for complaint . at one_point , the reader is two steps ahead of marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and marlowe is supposed_to be the pro . more bothersome , there_are several apparent anachronisms . contact lenses , tank tops , prostitutes openly working the streets of hollywood and the tequila sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s . a little more care in re-creating marlowe 's universe would_have made the book that much more enjoyable . mr. nolan is a contributing editor at los_angeles magazine .
