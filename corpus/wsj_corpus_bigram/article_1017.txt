deeply ingrained in both the book review `` kissing nature good-bye '' by stephen macdonald -lrb- leisure & arts , sept. 27 -rrb- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global_warming is entirely a result of human activity . is such a view justified ? in the absence of humans , would the earth enjoy a constant climate over the long_term ? clearly not . about 20,000 years_ago the last ice age ended . enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of north_america , northern europe and asia . this global_warming must have_been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few_hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves . furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global_warming . it is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global_warming . i bow to no_one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious_about global_warming we_must look_at the big picture and not allow the dominant culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-american-consumers-global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion . jocelyn tomkin astronomy department university of
