it was n't so_long ago that a radio network funded_by the u.s. congress -- and originally by the central_intelligence agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies . now , the network has opened a news bureau in the hungarian capital . employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` szabad europa radio '' -- radio_free europe . ``_i think_0 this is a victory for the radio , ''_says barnabas de bueky , a 55-year-old former hungarian refugee who_works in the munich , west_germany , headquarters as deputy_director of the hungarian service . in fact , the network hopes to set_up offices in warsaw and anywhere else in the east_bloc that will have it . but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one . in fact , radio_free europe is in danger of suffering_from its success . while the network currently can operate freely in budapest , so can others . in_addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many_ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled . instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , radio_free europe is more likely_to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring . `` they have a_lot 0 to do these_days to compete_with hungarian radio , ''_says andrew deak , a computer-science student at the technical university in budapest . `` the hungarian -lcb- radio -rcb- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . '' indeed , hungary is in the midst_of a media explosion . boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe . newsstands are packed with a colorful array_of magazines . radio and television are getting livelier and bolder . the british broadcasting_corp. and the u.s. state_department 's voice of america broadcast over hungarian airwaves , though only a few_hours a day each in hungarian . australian press magnate rupert_murdoch has bought 50_% stakes in two popular and gossipy hungarian newspapers , while britain_'s robert maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking_about similar moves . but radio_free europe does_n't plan to fade away . with its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says_0 it still has plenty 0 to do -- in hungary and in the `` great eastern beyond . '' radio_free europe and its sister station for the soviet_union , radio liberty , say_0 they wo_n't cut_back their more_than 19 hours of daily broadcasts . they_are still an_important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from bulgarian and belorussian to kazakh and kirghiz . the establishment of its first bureau in warsaw pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in eastern_europe . months before the decision by the hungarian communist_party to rename itself socialist and try_to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying_to look more hospitable . it proved a perfect time for radio_free europe to ask for permission to set_up office . not_only did the hungarian ministry of foreign affairs approve radio_free europe 's new location , but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` they found us four phone_lines in central budapest , ''_says geza szocs , a radio_free europe correspondent who helped organize the budapest location . `` that is a miracle . '' it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -lrb- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -rrb- . in fact , some of the network 's hungarian listeners say_0 they owe radio_free europe loyalty because it was responsible in many_ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` dark ages of the 20th_century . '' `` during the past_four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , ''_says the writer . `` there_were some very brave broadcasts . '' the listeners , too , had to be brave . through much of the post-world war_ii period , listening to western broadcasts was a crime in hungary . `` when we listen to the europe station , my mother still gets nervous , ''_says a budapest translator . `` she_wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . '' now , the toughest competition for radio_free europe comes during the late-night slot . hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight . television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` the end of the day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m . it is a talk_show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss hungary 's domestic problems as_well as foreign affairs . those_who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for `` sunday journal , '' on hungarian radio . the competitive spirit is clearly influencing radio_free europe , which is trying_to beef up programs . the budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in hungarian country towns from nagykanizsa in the west to nyiregyhaza in the east . the hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world . there 's also a host of new programs , trying_to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics . a daily 35-minute program called `` the march of time '' tries_to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world . there 's a program for women and a science show . and to attract younger listeners , radio_free europe intersperses the latest in western rock groups . the pet shop boys are big this_year in budapest . ``_we are starving for all the news , ''_says mr. deak , the student . `` every moment we_want to know everything about the world .
