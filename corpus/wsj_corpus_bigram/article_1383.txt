chase_manhattan bank chairman willard butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal republican , but on friday morning he had few kind words for president_bush 's economic policy-making . `` there_are some very significant issues out there , such_as the fiscal deficit , the trade_deficit , our relations with japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an_interview . ``_i 'd_like to see that initiative , and i have n't . there_is n't a big shot , an agenda . '' a few_hours later , the stock_market dropped 190_points . politicians tried_to finger each_other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that washington was singly responsible_for wall_street 's woes . but mr. butcher 's comments make one_thing clear : some on_wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic_policy . consider this : -- by 11:59 p.m. tonight , president_bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply_with the gramm-rudman budget law . the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . ``_we simply do_n't have strong leadership 0 to try_to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' house_budget committee_chairman leon panetta -lrb-_d. , calif . -rrb- said yesterday on nbc_news 's `` meet the press . '' -- for the last two_weeks , the bush_administration and the federal_reserve have_been engaged_in a semi-public battle_over international economic_policy . the administration has_been trying_to push the dollar lower ; the fed has_been resisting . `` one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the treasury_department and the federal_reserve board , '' said lawrence kudlow , a bear , stearns_& co. economist , on abc 's `` this_week . '' -- the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers . last_month , transportation_secretary sam skinner forced northwest_airlines to reduce a stake held by klm royal dutch airlines . but he has since run_into opposition from the treasury and the white_house over that decision . and he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for united_airlines , which_includes a big stake by british_airways plc . some_analysts say_0 uncertainty_about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one_reason that financing for the united_airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . in many_ways , the backdrop to friday_'s stock decline is eerily similar to that of october_1987 's 508-point crash . then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending_cuts were within days of taking hold . the treasury was locked in a battle_over international economic_policy , although at that time it was with west_german officials rather_than the federal_reserve . and concern about official actions aimed_at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing house_ways and means_committee rather_than the transportation_department -- were making markets nervous . the 1987_crash brought the reagan_administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more_than $ 76 billion -- even_though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period . but , barring further drops in the market this_week , a similar outcome does_n't seem likely this_year . lawmakers and administration_officials agree that friday_'s drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both_sides back to the table to try_to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would_be more serious and more far-reaching than last_spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely_to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . `` everybody thought_0 we were looking_at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking_at a recession , '' rep. panetta said yesterday in an_interview . `` that did_not happen . they learned 0 they could survive it without much problem . '' but administration_officials privately agree with mr. panetta , who said_0 a precipitous drop this_week `` is going_to force the president and congress to take a much harder look_at fiscal policy . '' in that case , there will_be plenty_of blame 0 to go around . `` there_is an underlying concern on the part_of the american people -- and there should_be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has_been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said senate_finance committee_chairman lloyd_bentsen -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- . nevertheless , it clearly will_take more_than friday_'s 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white_house budget_director richard_darman over the capital-gains fight . hill democrats are particularly angry over mr._bush 's claim that the capital-gains_cut was part_of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction_legislation . `` there_is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next_year because the administration simply did_n't live up to this_year 's deal , '' senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- said yesterday on cbs_news 's `` face the nation . '' during last_week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there_were signs that senate_republicans and the administration were at_odds . at the very moment that senate_republicans were negotiating a deal 0 to exclude capital_gains from the deficit-reduction_legislation , white_house spokesman marlin_fitzwater told_reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . when an_agreement was reached to strip capital_gains from the legislation , oregon sen. bob packwood , the ranking gop member of the tax-writing senate_finance committee , hailed it . asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : 0 `` the adminstration will have to speak for itself . '' friday_'s market tumble could spur action on reconciling the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest . senate_republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate , which on friday agreed_to drop a variety_of spending measures and tax_breaks that would_have increased the fiscal_1990 deficit . `` the market needs a strong signal that we_'re serious_about deficit reduction , and the best_way 0 to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , sen. warren rudman -lrb-_r. , n.h . -rrb- . said_0 yesterday . the white_house office of management and budget , whose calculations determine_whether the gramm-rudman targets are met , estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal_1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . rep. panetta said that omb 's figure would still be enough to_avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : 0 ``_we 're_getting very close to the margins here . '' no_one in washington was willing_to take the blame for provoking friday_'s drop in the stock_market . but some players were quick to seize the moment . before the sun had set on friday , richard rahn , the supply-side chief_economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock_prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital_gains . `` investors , who had_been holding assets in_anticipation of a more favorable time 0 to sell , were spooked , '' he said . `` there have_been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains_tax cut , '' sen._mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but i suggest 0 that is perhaps more_than any of the others .
