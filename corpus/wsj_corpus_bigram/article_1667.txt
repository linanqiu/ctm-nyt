revco d.s. inc. , the drugstore chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last_year , received a $ 925 million offer from a group_led by texas billionaire robert_bass . revco reacted cautiously , saying_0 the plan would add $ 260 million of new debt to the highly_leveraged company . it was revco 's huge debt from its $_1.3 billion leveraged_buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection_under chapter_11 of the federal_bankruptcy code . revco insists that the proposal is simply an `` expression of interest , '' because under_chapter 11 revco has `` exclusivity rights '' until feb. 28 . those rights prevent anyone other than revco from proposing a reorganization_plan . also under_chapter 11 , a reorganization_plan is_subject to approval by bondholders , banks and other creditors . a financial_adviser for revco bondholders , david schulte , of chilmark partners , had mixed reactions to the offer . he said_0 he feared 0 a revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a `` cheap deal , '' and that the bass group 's offer would_give them more money . however , the group is offering to pay_off bondholders in cash only -- $ 260.5 million -- and no equity . the revco bonds are high-yield , high-risk `` junk '' bonds ; holders have $_750 million in claims_against revco , mr. schulte said_0 . revco received the offer oct._20 , but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders . acadia partners_limited partnership , a fort_worth , texas , partnership that includes the robert_m. bass group , made the proposal . mr. bass is based in fort_worth . analysts said_0 the nation_'s second-largest drugstore chain was a valuable company , despite its financial woes . its problem , they say , is that management paid too_much in the leveraged_buy-out and the current $ 515 million debt_load is keeping revco in the red . `` if bought at the right price , it could still be profitable , '' said jeffrey stein , an_analyst at mcdonald &_co. , cleveland . in_addition , revco 's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a_lot of real_estate , he said_0 , and demographics are helping pharmacies : the nation_'s aging population will boost demand_for prescription_drugs . last_week , revco 's parent_company , anac holding corp. , said_0 the company reported a loss of $ 16.2 million for the fiscal_first quarter , compared_with a loss of $ 27.9 million in the year-earlier_quarter . sales were $ 597.8 million , up 2.4_% from the previous_year . the company , based in twinsburg , ohio , said_0 its operating_profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51_% , to $ 9.2 million from $ 6.1 million . acadia partners and the bass group declined to comment . the partnership also_includes american_express co. , equitable life assurance society of the u.s. and shearson_lehman hutton_inc . the offer consists of $ 410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes . acadia would sell up to 10_% of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution , but creditors and bondholders would_receive no discount for their shares . revco 's chairman and chief_executive officer , boake a. sells , said_0 both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans , but little progress has_been made since negotiations began this_summer . he said_0 he has not met_with representatives from acadia . any reorganization proposal , mr. sells said_0 , is difficult 0 to assess because it must_be agreed upon by the company , bondholders , banks and other creditors . revco has $_1.5 billion in claims outstanding . `` it 's not like the board can decide '' by itself , mr. sells said_0 , adding , ``_we 're indifferent to -lrb- the bass -rrb- plan . we just want a plan that satisfies creditors and at the end leaves a healthy revco . '' but mr. schulte , the bondholders ' adviser , said_0 revco was dragging its feet in responding to the proposal . `` they_want to pretend 0 it_does n't exist , '' he said . mr. schulte , who met_with acadia representatives on_oct. 10 , said , `` it 's certainly a responsible offer . it 's not an_effort to steal the company '' in the middle of the night .
