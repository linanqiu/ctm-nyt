japan air_lines , lufthansa german airlines and air_france reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this_year , a move that could further consolidate the industry . japanese newspaper nihon keizai shimbun reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems . they reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion_yen -lrb- $_140 million -rrb- in the venture , whose headquarters would_be in france or west_germany . the action follows federal_express corp. 's acquisition of flying tiger line inc. in_august . after that , `` it would make_sense for airlines to talk_about doing things jointly , '' said_0 cotton daly , director of cargo services for new_york consulting_firm simat , helliesen & eichner inc . mr._daly said_0 such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by federal_express , united parcel service of america inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies . many airlines are talking_about cargo ventures , and there have_been rumors about such a tie between jal and european airlines . in tokyo , a jal spokesman_said 0 he could_n't confirm or deny the latest japanese report . but he said_0 jal is talking to lufthansa and air_france about some_sort of cargo venture . `` it is just one of a number_of strategies 0 jal has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in europe after 1992 , '' the deadline for ending trade_barriers in the ec , he said_0 . in frankfurt , a lufthansa spokesman confirmed 0 talks are under_way , but declined to comment . a lufthansa spokeswoman in tokyo said_0 the head of lufthansa 's cargo operations had_been in toyko last_week for talks_with jal . in paris , air_france declined to comment . `` nothing is defined or signed at this point , '' mr._daly said of the talks . whatever accord the three carriers reach , he said_0 , he is skeptical 0 it would_create a separate airline . if the three companies pool their air-freight businesses , their clout would_be considerable . according_to figures from the international air_transport association , they carried a combined 1.8_million tons of freight last_year . federal_express and flying tiger , as separate companies , carried a combined 2.6_million tons . air_france and lufthansa last_month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities . they plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer_system 0 to process cargo . other airlines would_have access to the system , they said_0 , and negotiations_with partners were already under_way . both european airlines operate extensive fleets of boeing 747 freighters and 747 combis , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck . they currently have large orders for cargo planes . several airlines , including lufthansa , jal and cathay pacific airways , are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying_to attract other carriers to join , mr._daly said_0 . jal also has signaled 0 it is looking_for toeholds in europe before the end of 1992 . last_month , the carrier said_0 it wanted to lease crews and planes from british_airways so it could funnel its passengers from london to other european destinations . british_airways said_0 it has n't received a proposal from jal . but last_week there_were air-traffic negotiations between the u.k. and japan , a likely first_step to any commercial agreement_between jal and british_airways or another u.k. carrier .
