the commercial was absolutely silent . breaking into the raucous chicago bears-cleveland browns match during last_week 's monday night football game , it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed on the tv screen . `` due to the earthquake in san_francisco , nissan is donating its commercial air time to broadcast american red_cross emergency relief messages . please contribute what you_can , '' the ad said . the nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment , and then came a taped plea for donations from former_president reagan -- followed_by the silent print telling viewers where to call . within_two hours , viewers pledged over $_400,000 , according_to a red_cross executive . call it disaster marketing . nissan_motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating san_francisco quake and hurricane_hugo . sometimes , the ads attempt_to raise money ; always , they try_to boost good will . by advertising disaster_relief , these companies are hoping to don a white hat and come_out a hero . but the strategy can backfire ; if the ads appear too self-serving , the companies may end_up looking like rank opportunists instead of good samaritans . that has n't deterred plenty_of companies . along_with nissan , grand_metropolitan plc 's burger_king and new_york life_insurance have tied ads to red_cross donations . other ads do_n't bother with the fundraising ; a touching , if self-congratulatory , american_telephone &_telegraph ad that aired sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in san_francisco and charleston , s.c. , with interviews of people recounting how at&t helped . at nissan , ``_we felt 0 we_wanted to do_something to help them gather money , and we had this airtime on monday night football , '' explains 0 brooke mitzel , a nissan advertising creative manager . `` what did we get_out of it ? we got some exposure ... and pretty_much good will . '' the ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw . while tv commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past_couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even hours . the big brokerage_houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987_crash , when they turned_out reassuring ads inviting investors right back_into the stock_market . they trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few_weeks ago . nissan created its quake ad in a weekend . but as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency , they risk hurting themselves as_much as helping the cause . they chance alienating the customers 0 they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks . `` people see extra messages in advertising , and if a manufacturer is clearly trying_to get something out of it ... if it 's too transparent ... then consumers will see through that , '' warns john philip jones , chairman of the advertising department at the newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university . `` it can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too_far , be too pushy , '' agrees gary stibel , a principal with new_england consulting group , westport , conn . `` the ultimate form of charity is when_you do_n't tell anyone . '' still , he_says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have_been `` tasteless '' and that `` the majority have_been truly beneficial to the people_who need the help . we_do n't consider that ambulance chasing . '' the companies running the disaster ads certainly do_n't see themselves as ambulance chasers , either . burger_king 's chief_executive officer , barry gibbons , stars in ads saying that the fast-food_chain will donate 25_cents to the red_cross for every purchase of a bk doubles hamburger . the campaign , which started last_week and runs through_nov. 23 , with funds earmarked for both the quake and hugo , `` was barry 's idea , '' a spokeswoman says_0 . `` barry felt very committed . he felt 0 we should_be giving something back . '' while the campaign was mr. gibbons 's idea , however , he wo_n't be paying for it : the donations will come_out of the chain 's national advertising fund , which is financed_by the franchisees . and by basing donations on bk doubles , a new double-hamburger line 0 the fast-food_chain is trying_to push , burger_king works a sales pitch into its public-service message . toyota 's upscale lexus division , a sponsor of the world_series , also put in a plug for red_cross donations in a world_series game 0 it sponsored . `` the world_series is brought to you by lexus , who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused_by the recent earthquake ... , '' the game announcer said . and new_york life made a plea for red_cross donations in newspaper ads in the san_francisco area , latching onto the coattails of the red_cross 's impeccable reputation : `` the red_cross has_been helping people for 125 years . new_york life has_been doing the same for over 140 years . '' nancy craig , advertising manager for the red_cross , readily admits `` they_'re piggybacking on our reputation . '' but she has no problem with that , she_says 0 : `` in the meanwhile , they_'re helping us . '' the red_cross does_n't track contributions raised by the disaster ads , but it has amassed $ 46.6 million since it first launched its hurricane relief effort sept. 23 . ad_notes ... . new account : northrup king co. , golden valley , minn. , awarded its $_4 million field-crop-seeds account to creswell , munsell , fultz & zirbel , a cedar rapids , iowa , division of young_& rubicam . the account had previously been handled by saatchi_& saatchi wegener , new_york . tv guide : wieden & kennedy , portland , ore. , was_named to handle the news corp. publication 's $_1 million to $_2 million trade-ad account . n w ayer , the new_york agency that had handled the account since 1963 , resigned the account about two_weeks ago . no alcohol : miller_brewing co. will introduce its first non-alcoholic beer jan._1 . the brew , called miller sharp 's , will_be supported_by ads developed_by frankenberry , laughlin & constable , milwaukee .
