general_motors corp. 's general_counsel hopes to cut the number_of outside law_firms 0 the auto_maker uses from about 700 to 200 within_two years . harry j. pearce , named general_counsel in may 1987 , says_0 the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an_effort to let the no._1 auto_maker 's 134-lawyer in-house legal department take on matters 0 it is better equipped and trained to handle . gm trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list , mr. pearce says_0 . the move is consistent_with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house , instead of farming it out to law_firms . mr. pearce set_up gm 's first in-house litigation group in may with four lawyers , all former assistant_u.s. attorneys with extensive trial experience . he intends_to add to the litigation staff . among the types_of cases 0 the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing_business with gm and product-related actions , including one in which a driver is suing gm for damages resulting_from an_accident . mr. pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with gm 's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation . gm lawyers have_been working with technicians to develop more uniform welding procedures -- the way_0 a vehicle is welded has a_lot 0 to do with its durability . the lawyers also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems . mr. pearce says law_firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with gm will_be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from gm 's auto operations to suppliers . this does_n't necessarily_mean 0 larger firms have an advantage ; mr. pearce said_0 gm works with a number_of smaller firms 0 it regards highly . mr. pearce has shaken up gm 's legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions , including a special-projects group that has made films on safety and drunk driving . federal_prosecutors are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials . that 's a finding of a new study of the justice_department by researchers at syracuse university . david burnham , one of the authors , says_0 fewer trials probably means a growing_number of plea bargains . in 1980 , 18_% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial ; in 1987 , only 9_% did . the study covered 11 major u.s._attorneys ' offices --_including those in manhattan and brooklyn , n.y. , and new_jersey -- from 1980 to 1987 . the justice_department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing_to plea bargain . `` our felony caseloads have_been consistent for 20_years , '' with about 15_% of all prosecutions going_to trial , a department spokeswoman_said 0 . the discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the syracuse researchers said_0 they based their conclusions on government statistics . `` one possible explanation for this decline '' in taking cases to trial , says_0 mr. burnham , `` is that the number_of defendants being charged_with crimes by all u.s._attorneys has substantially increased . '' in 1980 , the study says_0 , prosecutors surveyed filed charges_against 25 defendants for each 100,000 people aged 18 years and older . in 1987 , prosecutors filed against 35 defendants for every 100,000 adults . another finding from the study : prosecutors set significantly different priorities . the manhattan u.s._attorney 's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987 , averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults . but the new_jersey u.s._attorney averaged 16 . on the civil side , the manhattan prosecutor filed an_average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same_period ; the san_francisco u.s._attorney averaged 79 . the study is to provide reporters , academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries . imelda marcos asks for dismissal , says_0 she was kidnapped . the former first lady of the philippines , asked a federal_court in manhattan to dismiss an indictment against her , claiming among_other things , that she was abducted from her homeland . mrs._marcos and her late husband , former philippines president ferdinand marcos , were_charged with embezzling more_than $_100 million from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real_estate in manhattan . mrs._marcos 's attorneys asked federal_judge john_f. keenan to give_them access to all u.s. documents about her alleged abduction . the u.s._attorney 's office , in documents 0 it filed in response , said_0 mrs._marcos was making the `` fanciful -- and factually unsupported -- claim that she was kidnapped into this_country '' in order to_obtain classified material in the case . the office also said_0 mrs._marcos and her_husband were n't brought to the u.s. against their will after mr. marcos was ousted as president . the prosecutor quoted statements from the marcoses in which they said_0 they_were in this_country at the invitation of president_reagan and that they_were enjoying the hospitality of the u.s. . lawyers for mrs._marcos say that because she was taken to the u.s. against her wishes , the federal_court lacks jurisdiction in the case . the federal_court of appeals in manhattan ruled_that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former bank of crete owner george koskotas should_be reconsidered . the indictment , which was sealed and apparently forgotten by investigators until 1987 , charges mr. koskotas and three others with tax fraud and other violations . he made numerous trips to the u.s. in the early_1980s , but was n't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-vice president george_bush at a government function . a federal_judge in manhattan threw out the indictment , finding that the seven-year delay violated the defendant 's constitutional_right to a speedy trial . the appeals_court , however , said_0 the judge did_n't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial . mr. koskotas is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to greece , where he is charged_with embezzling more_than $_250 million from the bank of crete . his attorney could_n't be_reached for comment . pro_bono voluntarism : in an_effort to stave off a plan that would_require all lawyers in new_york state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year , the state bar recommended an_alternative program 0 to increase voluntary participation in pro_bono programs . the state bar_association 's policy making body , the house of delegate , voted saturday to ask chief judge sol wachtler to give the bar 's voluntary program three_years 0 to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro_bono . ``_we believe_0 our suggested plan is more likely_to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro_bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness , distraction , administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear 0 would accompany an_attempt to impose a mandatory plan , '' said justin l. vigdor of rochester , who headed the bar 's pro_bono study committee . dallas and houston law_firms merge : jackson & walker , a 130-lawyer firm in dallas and datson & scofield , a 70-lawyer firm in houston said_0 they have agreed in_principle to merge . the consolidated firm , which would rank among the 10 largest in texas , would operate under the name jackson & walker . the merger must_be formally approved_by the partners of both firms but is_expected to be_completed by year end . jackson & walker has an office in fort_worth , texas , and dotson & scofield has an office in new_orleans . piling on ? piggybacking on government assertions that general_electric co. may_have covered up fraudulent billings to the pentagon , two shareholders have filed a civil racketeering suit_against the company . the suit was filed by plaintiffs_' securities lawyer richard d. greenfield in u.s._district court in philadelphia . he seeks damages from the company 's 15 directors on grounds that they either `` participated in or condoned the illegal acts ... or utterly failed to carry_out their duties as directors . '' ge is defending itself against government criminal_charges of fraud and false claims in_connection with a logistics-computer contract for the army . the trial begins today in federal_court in philadelphia . the government 's assertions of the cover-up were made in last_minute pretrial motions . ge , which vehemently denies the government 's allegations , denounced mr. greenfield 's suit . `` it is a cheap-shot suit -- procedurally defective and thoroughly fallacious -- which was hurriedly filed by a contingency-fee lawyer as a result of newspaper reports , '' said a ge spokeswoman . she_added that the company was considering bringing sanctions_against mr. greenfield for making `` grossly inaccurate and unsupported allegations .
