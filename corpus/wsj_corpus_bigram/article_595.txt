wall_street , shake hands with george orwell . the author of the futuristic novel `` 1984 '' invented a language called newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the state . wall_street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start . its language -- call it streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are . when something undeniably nasty happens , a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear , much_as a fresh grave may_be covered_by a blanket of flowers . for_example , we_'ll bet 0 you thought that the stock_market crashed two_years ago . wrong . according_to some of the grand panjandrums of the market , it never happened . in their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the dow_jones industrial_average on_oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip . trotting out a much-beloved streetspeak term , new_york stock_exchange chairman_john phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only `` a major technical correction . '' -lrb- another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain english , holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck . on_oct. 29 , 1929 -- a date 0 historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded c-word -- the dj industrials fell 12.8_% . in the `` technical correction '' of two_years ago , they lost a whopping 22.6 % . -rrb- customers hear a_lot of this stuff from people_who try_to sell them stock . these people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too_many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could_n't raise brokers on the phone . either_way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor . of the major new_york-based securities_firms , only morgan_stanley &_co. still calls its salespeople brokers . at merrill_lynch &_co. and shearson_lehman hutton_inc. , they_are `` financial consultants . '' at drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , prudential bache securities , and dean_witter reynolds_inc. , they_are `` account executives . '' at painewebber_inc. , they_are `` investment executives . '' such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products . it is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up 0 for them to peddle , do_n't feel . `` it s almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at dean_witter . the transmogrified brokers never let the c-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even_though these terms may_be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product . the names of some of these products do_n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either . a case in point : `` government-plus '' bond_funds . what could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ? what could_be better_than getting a tad more income from them -lrb- the plus -rrb- than other people ? indeed , conservative investors , many of them elderly , have poured more_than $ 50 billion into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary treasury_bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part_of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a gambler 's game . when a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for wall_street to give it a new moniker . this seems to be happening now to limited_partnerships , many of which either have_gone into the tank in recent_years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments . they_are still being_sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks 0 they had under the old label . in such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name . in others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has_changed . for_example , `` no load '' mutual_funds remain a favorite with investors because_they do_n't carry a frontend sales commission . getting_out of them , however , may_be a different story now . traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do_n't . in recent_years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have_been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6_% -- when an_investor sells his shares . should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ? the mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do_n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well . and do_n't expect anyone to change the term `` blue chip , '' either , even_though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may_be riskier investments than they_were . american_telephone &_telegraph co. , for one , is still a favorite of widows , orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture . also , blue_chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent_years . larry biehl , a money_manager in san_mateo , calif. , blames that on the advent of program_trading , in which computers used by big_institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big_blocks when certain market_conditions prevail . blue_chips , he_says 0 , `` are now being referred to as poker chips . '' finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no_longer means what it once did . before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects . now , says_0 mr. biehl , value investing often means `` looking_for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble . '' to institutional_investors or brokers , he_adds 0 , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up . ms. bettner covers personal finance from the wall_street journal 's los_angeles bureau .
