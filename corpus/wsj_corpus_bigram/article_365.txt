in terms of sheer brutality , the somali regime of siad barre may rank as no._1 in the world . the only reason that somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5_million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of texas . the barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people 0 it can torture and kill . beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the somali armed forces have_been engaged_in over the past_two years . up to 500,000 somalis have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops . in the port of berbera , for_example , hundreds_of men of the rival issak clan were rounded up in may 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be_executed without_any judicial process whatsoever . guns were never used : each man was stabbed to death with a large knife . the horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based_on hundreds_of interviews with randomly selected refugees . the study was done by robert gersony , a consultant to the u.s. state_department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both_sides of the left-right ideological divide . what gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact_that they_are part_of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet_union on the horn of africa . not since the late_1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past_few weeks . mr. barre 's rule is crumbling fast . mutinies wrack his armed forces -lrb- really just an armed gang -rrb- , which control less_than half the country . inflation is at record levels . desperate , he has called in the libyans to help fight the rebels of the somali national movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of mogadishu . seventy years_old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' president barre has a power base , composed only of his minority mareham clan , that according_to observers is `` narrowing . '' the u.s. 's interest in somalia consists of a single runway at the port of berbera , which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the gulf of aden and the indian_ocean . that strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a_handful of american nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft_drinks and back issues of sports illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . in the past_two years , the desert behind them has_become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to mr. barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . as long as the rival soviet-backed regime of mengistu haile mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring ethiopia , the u.s. was forced to accept that lonely berbera runway as a distant no._2 to the soviets ' array_of airfields next_door . but due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past_few days and weeks , those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the american runway . on sept. 7 , i wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 ethiopian soldiers by eritrean and tigrean guerrillas . recently , in wollo province in the center of ethiopia , tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an_additional 20,000 government troops . -lrb- think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds_of deaths in lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance ! -rrb- tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of addis ababa , threatening the town of dese , which would cut_off mr. mengistu 's capital from the port of assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach addis ababa . as a result , mr. mengistu has_been forced to transfer thousands_of troops from eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in eritrea only to_keep the tigreans at bay . mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : half his army is tied down defending the northern city of asmara from the eritreans . the weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the u.s. for help . while the tigreans are communists , like the eritreans they_are among the most anti-soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more_than a decade of aerial bombardment by the soviet-supplied mengistu air_force . what this all means in shorthand is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is collapsing as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is . the u.s. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human_rights in somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late_1970s on the horn of africa . back to somalia : the state_department , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from mr. barre , evinced by its decision to publish the gersony report -lrb- which the press has ignored -rrb- . what 's more , the u.s. has suspended $_2.5 million in military_aid and $_1 million in economic aid . but this is not enough . because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre , when he goes the runway could go too . considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would_be for the bush_administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential somalis to understand . it is a certainty that mr. barre 's days are numbered . the u.s. should take care , however , that its_own position in the country does_not go down with him . nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might_be . but as one expert tells me : `` whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse_than barre . '' while the state_department positions itself for the post-barre period in somalia , it should continue to back former_president carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between mr. mengistu and the eritrean guerrillas in ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the tigrean rebels through neighboring sudan . ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and byzantine in all of black africa . remember that it took mr. mengistu many months , in what became known_as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple emperor haile selassie in 1974 and 1975 . there_is simply no_way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent . but the u.s. has one great advantage : the soviets are universally loathed throughout ethiopia for what they_did to the country this past_decade -- famine and all . it 's not just in eastern_europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side , but on the horn of africa as_well . the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre , and that should_be cut fast . mr. kaplan , author of `` surrender or starve : the wars behind the famine '' -lrb- westview press , 1988 -rrb- , lives in lisbon .
