garry kasparov went to combat sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered deep thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . then he unleashed his_own , unstoppable , attack . and in the second game , with mr._kasparov advancing ferociously as white , d.t. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster . well , mankind can rest easier for now . though almost everybody at the playing site had_been looking_for the 26-year-old soviet to beat the pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected . and when mr._kasparov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome . as if he were iron mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : ``_i 'll_be able_to beat any computer for the next five_years . '' his strategy against d.t. was based_on a thorough study of dozens_of its games , he said_0 , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters bent larsen of denmark and robert byrne of the u.s. . mr._kasparov was underwhelmed . `` the computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said_0 . the champion apparently was not worried at all about d.t. 's strong points . its chief builder , taiwan-born feng-hsiung hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions . d.t. also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could_n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the new_york academy of art . in fact , d.t. never left home , carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link . they conceded_that the odds favored mr._kasparov , but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 . but the handlers mistakenly stuck_with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . this became_apparent as game one , a sicilian defense by mr._kasparov , proceeded . no human can examine millions of moves , but mr._kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very_good ones . after eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which nigel short of great_britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . but the computer did_n't play mr. short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly . instead of castling , a standard measure 0 to safeguard the king , d.t. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16 . `` only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said edmar mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds_of chess fans . by move 21 , d.t. had_fallen into a deep positional trap . it allowed mr._kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of d.t. 's knights . bishops usually are worth slightly_more than knights , but in this case mr._kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity . indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it . consistently , d.t. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form . when most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought_0 it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down . such evaluations met_with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as_soon as humans would_have -- prompting more derision . while d.t. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , mr._kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost . he also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude d.t. 's king . no amount of weasling could have saved this game for d.t . a piece down , the computer resigned . now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast mr._kasparov could win game two . with the advantage of playing white -lrb- which moves first -rrb- , mr._kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a queen 's gambit accepted . as early as move six , mr._kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight . this left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development . `` in a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' mr._kasparov said later . in such positions , he explained 0 , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able_to do that right_now . '' after only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky . greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack . and when a defensive move was called for , d.t. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . mr._kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would_have avoided the queen move . now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking_for a mating combination . on a demonstration board , emcee shelby lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . mr._kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly . he won d.t. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , 0 to give the computer much hope . in a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather_than make its 37th move . and mr._kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back_into the analysis room . `` in both games i got exactly_what i wanted , '' he said . what he had demonstrated , he_added 0 , is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation . undeterred , d.t. 's handlers vowed to press on . indeed , three of them will_be building a successor machine for international_business machines corp . promises feng-hsiung hsu : `` in three_years we_'ll mount a better challenge .
