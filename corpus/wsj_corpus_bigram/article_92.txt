'' axa would also maintain farmers_' relationships_with the insurance exchanges that it manages . mr._bebear made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as_part of a tour in which he is trying_to rally support in the u.s. for the proposed_acquisition . the bid is part_of sir_james goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover_attempt for b.a.t_industries plc , the british tobacco , retailing , paper and financial-services giant that acquired farmers last_year for $ 5.2 billion . axa has_agreed to_acquire farmers from sir_james 's investment vehicle , hoylake investments ltd. , for $_4.5 billion plus a $_1 billion investment in hoylake . any acquisition of farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers operates , and mr._bebear 's trip will_take him to idaho , arizona and new_york after his stay here ; he will meet with insurance regulators , legislators , industry excutives and the press . hearings on axa 's acquisition application have_been set for nov._13 in idaho ; nov._20 in illinois ; nov._24 and dec._4 in arizona ; dec. 11 in washington state ; and jan. 8 in oregon . hearings have n't_yet been set in texas , ohio and kansas . california 's insurance commissioner does_n't hold hearings on acquisition applications . although axa has_been rebuffed by farmers and has n't had any meetings with management , mr._bebear nonetheless appears to be trying_to woo the company 's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under axa . he said_0 mr. denlea would_be a member of the top_management team of the axa-midi group of companies , and would `` help define policies and strategies of the group .
