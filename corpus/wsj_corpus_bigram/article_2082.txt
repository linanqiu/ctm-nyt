cie. de navigation_mixte chairman marc fournier said_0 his board unanimously rejected as too_low the $ 1.77 billion bid by cie. financiere_de paribas to bring its stake_in navigation_mixte to 66.7 % . at a news_conference , mr._fournier accused paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company , whose interests include insurance , banking , tuna canning , sugar and orange juice . the chairman said_0 his board members , including representatives of west_german insurance giant allianz ag and french banks credit_lyonnais and societe_generale , hold nearly 50_% of navigation_mixte 's capital . mr._fournier said that as navigation_mixte chairman , he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his_own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business . but sources_said 0 he will_be urging his allies to boost their stakes in navigation_mixte , which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday . at the same_time , he is_expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid . for the moment , the sources_said 0 , he has decided against seeking a white_knight or organizing a counterbid for paribas . mr._fournier said_0 navigation_mixte 's 1989 unconsolidated , or parent-company , profit is_likely to be 4.7 billion_francs -lrb- $ 754.4 million -rrb- , up from 633.8 million_francs last_year . that is due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the 50_% stake 0 it has_agreed to_acquire in navigation_mixte 's insurance business . mr._fournier said_0 the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice_as high a dividend this_year as last . if holders avoid tendering to paribas , he_added 0 , they_can expect strong dividends again next_year . analysts noted_that over the past 20_years , mr._fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at_least three takeover attempts . this time , however , some_analysts think_0 he could face a real battle . `` without some unexpected `` coup de theatre '' , i_do n't see what will block the paribas bid , '' said philippe de cholet , analyst_at the brokerage cholet-dupont & cie . mr. de cholet said_0 mr._fournier 's_biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid . paribas still needs the go-ahead from the commission des operations de bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said_0 that is considered likely . mr._fournier also_noted that navigation_mixte joined paribas 's core of shareholders when paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said_0 it now holds just under 5_% of paribas 's shares . once he realized that paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said_0 , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his paribas stake above 10_% . the petition is still pending , but mr._fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover_bid of his_own for the much-larger paribas . one big question now is the likely role of mr._fournier 's allies . mr._fournier said_0 the large institutions that hold nearly 50_% of navigation_mixte 's capital all strongly support him , but some_analysts said_0 they_are n't so sure . allianz , for_example , has said in official comments so_far that it will_remain neutral . paribas is allianz 's lead french bank . paribas said monday that it_intends to bid to boost its stake_in navigation_mixte to 66.7 % , from the 18.7 % 0 it already_owns . the purchase of the additional 48 %_stake is_expected to cost more_than 11 billion_francs -lrb- $ 1.77 billion -rrb- . paribas says_0 it will offer 1,850 francs_-lrb- $ 296.95 -rrb- each for navigation_mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights , and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued july 1 , which will_receive only partial dividends this_year . alternatively , it is to offer three paribas shares for one navigation_mixte share . the paribas offer values navigation_mixte at about 23 billion_francs , depending_on how_many of navigation_mixte 's warrants are converted_into shares during the takeover_battle .
