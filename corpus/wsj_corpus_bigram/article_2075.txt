an enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed : he has made speaking filipino respectable . the 6 1\/2-foot-tall turtle , pong pagong , is a character who stars in the children 's television show ``_batibot . '' he speaks only in filipino . ``_batibot , '' which started in_1983 as a hybrid of the u.s. program `` sesame street , '' has_developed into a distinctly philippine effort . radio programs and books have followed the daily television show . in the process , ``_batibot , '' an archaic filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring , '' has_become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language . `` it impresses on ordinary , young filipinos that there 's nothing 0 to feel inferior about in using their_own language , ''_says randy david , a sociologist and host of a popular television talk_show . `` when we started the program six_years ago , the use of filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class , ''_says lydia brown , the program 's creator . now , she_says 0 , `` it 's no_longer an issue . '' the success of ``_batibot '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts_to promote filipino as a national language . filipino -- once known_as pilipino -- is predominantly tagalog , the malay-based language spoken in a part_of the country 's principal island of luzon . resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite , who generally prefer english . but while better-off filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english , they_are often slow to reveal that they_are prejudiced against filipino , say_0 advocates of the native language . `` for the middle and upper-middle class -lcb- filipino -rcb- is declasse , ''_says bien lumbera , a philippine-studies professor_at quezon city 's university of the philippines . there 's also resentment . other opponents of filipino come from non-tagalog regions . they_argue that their_own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more_than any other language . -lrb- there_are seven major languages and more_than 70 dialects in the country . -rrb- what tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines . it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. , in philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography . as they_did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. , teachers for the most part teach in english , even_though it is a foreign language for most philippine children . as a result , they often speak one language at home , another at school . mrs. brown calls the modern-day cultural ambivalence to filipino a `` language schizophrenia . '' the issue has_been simmering for years . it_does n't take much to provoke an intense debate . when president corazon aquino , whose command of filipino is spotty , announced last_year that the language would_be used in official communications , there was an uproar from many legislators , who continue to conduct debates mostly in english . but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling . they believe the media , including ``_batibot , '' have played a crucial role . according_to chief scriptwriter rene villanueva , ``_batibot '' does_n't set out to advance the cause of filipino . `` it 's not as if we_'re teaching language per se , '' he_says , ``_we 're just using it . '' these_days , ``_batibot '' is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 a one-hour segment . it is shown weekdays on two of the country 's five networks . with an audience totaling more_than 400,000 , ``_batibot '' consistently ranks in the country 's top-four most-watched daytime programs . but advertising revenue is inadequate . periodically , there_are threats that the program will fold . ``_batibot '' lacks the polish of `` sesame street . '' sound stages echo . acting sometimes falls flat . there_are only two large puppets in the program : pong pagong and a monkey named kiko matsing . but the production is the equal of any local program . and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies . the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such_as nuclear_weapons and the environment . not that the language war is won , even on ``_batibot . '' during one recent episode , all the advertisements were in english .
