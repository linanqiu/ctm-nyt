for cathay pacific airways , the smooth ride may_be ending . the first signs of trouble came last_month when the hong_kong carrier , a subsidiary of swire pacific ltd. , posted a 5_% drop in operating_profit for the first_six months and warned_that margins will_remain under_pressure for the rest of the year . securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cathay 's interim figures , believe_0 more jolts lie ahead . fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through hong_kong remains clouded by china_'s turmoil since the june_4 killings in beijing . in_addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had_been hired to man the planes . and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an_important sideline . there also is concern that once hong_kong reverts to china_'s sovereignty in 1997 , cathay will_be forced to play second fiddle to china_'s often-disparaged flag carrier , civil aviation_administration of china , or caac . `` the sense is 0 we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way_0 it did before , ''_says rod eddington , cathay 's commercial director . sarah hall , an_analyst at james_capel -lrb- far_east -rrb- ltd. , says_0 there_is n't much 0 cathay can_do about rising costs for jet fuel , hong_kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the u.s. dollar . these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , ms. hall says_0 . ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around 13_% annually this_year and next . in 1988 , it earned_$ 2.82 billion hong_kong -lrb-_us$ 361.5 million -rrb- on revenue of hk$ 11.79 billion . cathay is taking several steps to bolster business . one step is to beef up its fleet . in_addition to aircraft from boeing_co. , cathay announced earlier_this year an order for as many as 20 airbus a330-300s . the expansion , which could cost as_much as us$ 5.7 billion over the next eight_years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last_year , according_to sun hung kai securities ltd . the fuel-efficient airbus planes will_be used largely to replace cathay 's aging fleet of lockheed tristars for regional flights , while the boeing aircraft will_be used on long-haul routes to europe and north_america . cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside hong_kong . fierce bidding for young employees in hong_kong is pushing up cathay 's labor_costs by 20_% a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as_part of the brain drain . some jobs already have_been moved to australia , and there_are plans to place others in canada . david bell , a spokesman for the airline , says_0 the move is partly aimed_at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . cathay is working to_promote hong_kong as a destination worth visiting on its_own merits , rather_than just a stopover . although the june_4 killings in beijing have hurt its china flights , cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors . mr._eddington regards promoting hong_kong as an_important part_of attracting visitors from japan , south_korea and taiwan , where the number_of people looking to travel abroad has surged . there also has_been speculation_that cathay will_be among the major private-sector participants in the hong_kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its_own terminal . cathay officials decline to comment_on the speculation . mr._eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly cathay 's recent link with amr_corp. 's american_airlines -- as an_important part_of cathay 's strategy . but he emphasizes that cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa , the west_german airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . analysts_believe 0 cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has_grown among european carriers . ``_we think_0 alliances are very_important , '' mr._eddington says . `` but we_'d rather put funds into our_own business rather_than someone_else 's . i_'m not sure_0 cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . '' in a pattern 0 it aims to copy in several_key u.s. destinations , cathay recently_announced plans to serve san_francisco by flying into american_airlines ' los_angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier . ``_we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. , and they_'ll never have one as big as us in the pacific , '' mr._eddington says . `` but this way , american will coordinate good extensions to boston , new_york , chicago and dallas . we_'ll coordinate on this end to places like bangkok , singapore and manila . '' asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65_% of cathay 's business , is_expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay . cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into vietnam . further expansion into southern europe is also possible , says_0 mr. bell , the spokesman . while a large_number of hong_kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an_option for cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in hong_kong . and mr._eddington emphatically rules out a move to london : `` our lifeblood is hong_kong traffic rights . '' he_says 0 the airline is putting its faith in the sino-british agreement on hong_kong 's return to china . a special section dealing_with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong_kong 's airlines , which include the smaller hong_kong dragon airlines , will_continue to be negotiated by hong_kong 's government . but critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will_be responsible to beijing . `` my feeling is 0 -lcb- cathay does_n't -rcb- have a hope in the long_run , ''_says an_analyst , who declines to be_identified . `` cathay would love to_keep going , but the general sense is 0 they_'re going_to have to do_something . '' mr._eddington acknowledges_that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the sino-british agreement is firm ground 0 to build on for the foreseeable future . ``_we 're confident_that it protects our route structure , '' he_says , `` and our ability_to grow and prosper .
