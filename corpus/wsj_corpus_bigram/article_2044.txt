the surprise resignations of two top economic government_officials heaped more uncertainty on london 's financial_markets , which already have_been laboring under worries_about britain_'s ailing economy . `` the last thing 0 markets like is uncertainty , '' said ian harwood , chief_economist at s.g. warburg &_co. , of the resignations of chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson and chief economic adviser sir_alan walters . ``_i think_0 you_'ll see share prices go down , and sterling now is under something of a cloud . '' the pound immediately began to take a buffetting after the resignations were announced . in late new_york trading , sterling stood_at $ 1.5765 , down from $ 1.6145 late_wednesday . the british economy is hardly the picture of health these_days . at 15_% , base interest_rates are the highest in eight_years , and the 7.6 % annual inflation_rate is by far the highest in the european_community . unions are pressing demands for wage_increases of more_than 10_% despite general belief_that economic_growth next_year will_be less_than 2_% . increasingly , the financial_markets are reflecting the gloom . the financial_times 100-share_index has dropped about 12_% from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on sept. 8 . yesterday , even_before the resignations were announced , the index dove 32.5 points to close_at 2129.4 . ``_we are expecting a recession , ''_says donald franklin , chief_economist at schroders investment_bank . `` the only question is , how deep is it going_to be ? the outlook for corporate earnings is fairly bleak . it 's quite likely 0 we_'re going_to get repeats '' of the mid-october market shocks . red_ink already_has begun to flow in the wake_of the u.s.-u.k. market breaks of oct._13 and oct._16 . london-based lit holdings , the largest financer of traders in the chicago options and futures_markets , said yesterday 0 it will incur a second-half loss as a result of the market_plunge . the company , which also will omit its second-half dividend , did_n't specify the size . but company insiders estimated that the loss could approach the equivalent of $ 10 million . christopher castleman , lit chief_executive , said in an_interview that the loss stemmed_from the default of three options_traders who had bet on a price rise in ual_corp. shares before oct._13 . the price plummeted after a proposed leveraged_buy-out of the airline fell through . lit holdings shares plummeted 36 pence to close_at 54 pence_-lrb- 85 cents -rrb- , a 40_% drop , on london 's stock_exchange . denizens of london 's financial_district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows . `` a_lot more of our_customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time , ''_says christopher brown , managing_director of corney & barrow restaurants ltd. , which runs five tony wine bars in the district . `` there 's a strong sense among the martini set that there 's more -lcb- bad_news -rcb- 0 to come , '' asserts roger yates , chief investment officer at morgan_grenfell asset_management . `` people in the stock_market were very_much thatcher 's children -- very young and wealthy optimists . now it 's dawning on them that they_can be non-wealthy . '' the malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s , before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry 's deregulation in 1986 . `` people come to us saying_0 they_'d like to be back where they_were a few_years ago , in a more collegial atmosphere , with less tension , ''_says stephen waterhouse , managing_director of hanover partners ltd. , a financial_district head-hunting firm . but after trading losses in the mid-october market jolts here , many_people will_be lucky to have jobs at all , executives predict 0 . the industry , which currently employs_about 25,000 people in london , has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past_two years . ``_i can see cuts of at_least 20_% more , ''_says the head of the london office of a major u.s. firm . the mergers and acquisitions market has_been a saving grace for the industry , but uncertainties are beginning to mount even there . intra-european takeovers are_expected to continue at their brisk pace . but investment_bankers say that stock_market uncertainties in the u.s. may cause many european companies to mark time before bidding for american companies , in the hope that share prices will come down . `` if prices in the states go down , industrial buyers in europe have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the u.s. , ''_says francois von hurter , chief of continential m&a at credit_suisse first_boston ltd . but he_adds : `` everybody and his sister have opened up m&a shops . it 's difficult to see that there 's going_to be enough business 0 to go around . about eight firms will get the lion 's share . at the others , there_are going_to be a_lot of disappointments , after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to people . '' it all adds up to a cold winter here . says allen d. wheat , head of trading at bankers_trust co. : `` people are just plain scared . '' one_person who is past worrying_about london 's blues is christopher hartley . last_summer , he chucked his 10-year career as a london stockbroker and headed for the mountains . he did_n't stop until he got to jackson hole , wyo . ``_i 'm glad to be out , '' said the 32-year-old mr. hartley in a phone interview . `` the percentage of your day spent twiddling your thumbs got greater , and the work day kept getting longer . what am i doing in jackson hole ? not a great_deal . my wife and i will stay through the skiing season , or until the money runs out -- whichever comes first . but unlike london , out here i_'ve never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger .
