business week subscribers may hear this_week 's issue talking back to them . a four-page ad from texas_instruments inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the oct._20 `` corporate elite '' issue of the mcgraw-hill_inc. publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages . readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human-sounding -- voice announce , ``_i am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15-second discourse on its_own attributes . the talking chip is n't cheap -- the per-ad cost to texas_instruments is about $_4 , and that 's without adding in business week 's charge -- but texas_instruments believes_0 it is a first . previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more_sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for_example , when calling telephone directory services . and for those_who miss the message the first_time around , not to worry : three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays .
