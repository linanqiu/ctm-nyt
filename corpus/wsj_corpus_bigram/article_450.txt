confidence in the pound is widely_expected to take another sharp dive if trade_figures for september , due for release tomorrow , fail to show a substantial improvement from july and august 's near-record deficits . chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson_'s restated commitment to a firm monetary_policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past_week . but analysts reckon 0 underlying support for sterling has_been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his mansion house speech last_thursday . this has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16_% from their current 15_% level to defend the pound , economists and foreign_exchange market analysts_say 0 . `` the risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily_on the down side , '' said chris dillow , senior u.k. economist_at nomura research_institute . `` if there_is another bad trade number , there could_be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted simon briscoe , u.k. economist for midland montagu , a unit of midland bank_plc . forecasts for the trade_figures range widely , but few economists_expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # 2_billion -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- deficit in the current_account reported for august . the august deficit and the # 2.2_billion gap registered in july are topped only by the # 2.3_billion deficit of october_1988 . sanjay joshi , european economist_at baring brothers &_co. , said_0 there_is no_sign that britain_'s manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports . at the same_time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital_goods inflows . he reckons 0 the current_account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8_billion in_september . however , mr. dillow said_0 he_believes that a reduction in raw_material stockbuilding by industry could_lead to a sharp_drop in imports . combined_with at_least some rebound in exports after august 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3_billion . mr. briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3_billion current_account gap , warns that even_if the trade_figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo_n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions . nevertheless , he_noted 0 , `` no_one will want to go_into the trade_figures without a flat position '' in the pound . meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded . in his mansion house speech , mr._lawson warned_that a further slowdown can_be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest_rates earlier_this month takes effect . u.k. base rates are at their highest_level in eight_years . but consumer expenditure data released friday do_n't suggest_that the u.k. economy is slowing that quickly . the figures show that spending rose 0.1_% in the third_quarter from the second_quarter and was up 3.8_% from a year_ago . this compares_with a 1.6 %_rise in the second from the first_quarter and a 5.4 %_increase from the second_quarter of 1988 . mr. dillow said_0 the data show 0 the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather_than consumer_goods should reduce fears of more import rises . certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest_rates again if_necessary to both ensure_that a substantial slowdown does take_place and that sterling does_n't decline further . thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can_not allow the necessary rigor of monetary_policy to be undermined by exchange_rate weakness . '' analysts agree 0 there_is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than mr._lawson 's promise that rates will_be pushed higher if_necessary . and , they warn 0 , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow . sterling was already showing some signs of a lack_of confidence in mr._lawson 's promise friday . in european trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks_late thursday . economists suggested_that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will_be forced to increase rates to 16_% , both to halt any further decline and ensure_that the balance of monetary_policy remains unchanged . friday_'s market_activity the dollar posted gains in quiet_trading as concerns_about equities abated . foreign_exchange dealers_said that the currency market has_begun to distance itself from the volatile stock_exchange , which has preoccupied the market since oct._13 , when the dow_jones industrial_average plunged more_than 190_points . currency analysts_predict that in the coming week the foreign_exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by u.s. federal_reserve . late in the new_york trading day , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470_marks late_thursday in new_york . the u.s._currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in new_york late_thursday . in tokyo on monday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen , up from friday_'s tokyo_close of 141.35 yen . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery settled_at $ 367.30 an_ounce , up 20 cents . estimated_volume was a light 2.4_million ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong monday , gold was_quoted at $ 366.50 an_ounce .
