there may_be a truce in the long war of nerves between the white_house and congress over how this_country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad . after years of mistrust born of watergate , past misdeeds of the central_intelligence agency , and the iran-contra scandal , president_bush and the senate_intelligence committee appear ready -- for now , at_least -- to trust each_other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities . if that attitude lasts , it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years . over the past_week , the president has_agreed to_keep the committee informed , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing . that was n't_always the way_0 the reagan_administration handled such matters . mr._bush has pledged as_well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring u.s. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do_so . congress never fully trusted former cia chief william casey and national_security adviser john poindexter to honor the ban . despite objections by the cia , mr._bush also has_agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the cia who would_be independent of the cia director . in return , the senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity . it also has removed a ban_on cia use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has_agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions_on coup planning put in place to ensure_that the cia did_n't get_back in the assassination game . ``_we 've finally been_able to convince them that casey and -lcb- oliver -rcb- north do_n't work here anymore , ''_says one administration official . the new understanding did_n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light . it emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this_month 's failed_coup attempt in panama . the white_house used television appearances and leaks to argue_that congressionally imposed restrictions_on covert actions made u.s. support for such coups difficult . mr._bush even disclosed privately that one reagan-era deal_with congress required him to notify the odious panamanian dictator , manuel_noriega , if the u.s. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life . the president also hinted 0 he might veto this_year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive . intelligence_committee chairman david_boren -lrb-_d. , okla . -rrb- and vice_chairman william cohen -lrb-_r. , maine_-rrb- , for their part , angrily accused the white_house of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to congress for the bungled attempt_to topple gen._noriega . the white_house got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind_of constitutional confrontation sought_by conservative republicans who do_n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities . instead , mr._bush and his aides made it clear 0 they respected congress 's role and felt 0 they could work with the conservative mr._boren and the moderate mr. cohen to iron out their differences . the senators responded in kind . sen. boren happily told_reporters that there had_been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the white_house , and that the committee had given mr._bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the reagan years . sen. cohen said_0 the relationship has reverted to its pre-reagan character . there still are some details 0 to be nailed down . mr._bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to_keep congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative 0 the committee does_n't recognize . and a pending justice_department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would_have to be settled . moreover , both_sides may face political critics . some conservatives will accuse the president of promising congress too_much . and they continue anonymously attacking cia director william webster for being too accommodating to the committee . at the same_time , some congressional liberals will accuse sens. boren and cohen of wimping out , and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of nicaraguan harbors and the iran arms sales . but if the cooperative attitude holds and there_is greater consultation on covert activities , the country could_be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards , while risky but well-planned secret operations can_be undertaken without fear that a panicky congress will balk .
