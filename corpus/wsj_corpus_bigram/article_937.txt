within minutes after the stock_market closed friday , i called sen. bill bradley of new_jersey , advised him that the dow_jones industrial_average had declined by 190_points late that afternoon , and cheerfully informed him that he and his_fellow democrats were to blame . they had dealt a major setback that afternoon to president_bush 's capital-gains_tax cut proposal , which had seemed in the bag after it passed the house overwhelmingly earlier in the month . sen. bradley has it in his mind that such a tax_cut would unravel the tax_reform 0 he helped engineer in 1986 . but he knows that as many as 20 of his_fellow democrats are disposed to vote for the cut , popular among their constituents . as a result , he took the lead in arguing_that the cut should_be blocked on procedural grounds . he helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and majority_leader george_mitchell on these grounds . the budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the oct._15 deadline , and these senate_democrats refused_to agree to allow a vote 0 to append capital_gains to the budget bill , knowing 0 it would pass . denied a vote_on substance , the gop leadership in the senate on friday morning was confronted with a hard choice . it could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital_gains late this_month , or it could follow the white_house strategy , to veto reconciliation unless capital_gains was appended . the u.s. chamber of commerce has_been in the forefront in supporting the bush proposal . it endorsed the white_house strategy , believing it to be the surest way to victory . at noon friday , a senior white_house official advised richard rahn , the chamber 's chief_economist , that the white_house would not agree to a budget reconciliation_bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote_on substance would_be permitted in the senate . two_hours later , the first word emerged on_capitol hill that the administration had agreed_to reconciliation with no such assurances from senate_democrats . mr. rahn was shocked , telephoning the office of richard_darman , director of the office of management and budget , and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue . he left a message accusing mr. darman of selling out . it was the senate_republicans , though , who had edged away_from the veto strategy . the stock_market reacted as mr. rahn did , crumbling as it absorbed the news that mr. darman 's strategy had_been abandoned . the stock_market , after all , represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation_'s capital stock , discounted to present value . why_should it be so surprising that a 30_% cut in the capital-gains_tax would_have such an enormous impact_on the value of the nation_'s capital stock ? the total_value of privately held assets is easily more_than $ 15 trillion . the value traded on the exchanges is close to $_3 trillion . if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled , would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets ? is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset 0 you own would_be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if_you sold it , you would_be able_to keep 30_% more of its gain than you previously believed 0 ? indeed , the stock_market 's steady advance this_year tracked with president_bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal . a 30_% cut in this_year 's capital_gains alone amounts to roughly $ 50 billion . we_'re talking real money . when richard rahn advised the financial press that the market_crash was caused_by the setback to capital_gains , he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed . instead , the press corps readily accepted the notion_that a snag in the takeover financing of united_airlines instantly knocked 7_% off the value of the nation_'s capital stock and caused convulsions around the world . mr. rahn was pointing_out an elephant rumbling through wall_street while conventional_wisdom had fastened on the ual flea . why is this happening ? for one_thing , quite a number_of the leading spokesmen on_wall street are not portfolio_managers , who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected_by how government taxes those assets . they_are economists and financial reporters who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains_tax cut benefits the rich . yet they somehow think that wall_street is indifferent to losing the tax_cut that seemed so close friday morning and is now problematic . the market rebound monday followed weekend assurances from mr. darman that the administration has other plans 0 to win the cut , which is alive and well . sen. bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains_tax cut would_be bad for the economy in the longer run . it would inevitably lead to an_increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 , he_thinks 0 , when the white_house is forced to ask for higher taxes 0 to meet budget targets . that is , with capital_gains cut , the glue of the 1986 accord will_be gone , and political realities will push up income-tax rates . the counter-argument , which he has heard , is that if he and his_fellow democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal , the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy . in this atmosphere , there would_be no serious consideration of tax increases . if sen. bradley would_permit a vote_on capital_gains , though , it would pass , christmas retail_sales would_be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock_market , the 1990 economy would_be robust , and the revenue gains at every level of government , including new_jersey 's , would_be surprisingly high . no tax increases would_be necessary . the struggle over capital_gains is the most_important game in town . in washington and on_wall street . mr. wanniski is president of polyconomics inc. , of morristown , n.j .
