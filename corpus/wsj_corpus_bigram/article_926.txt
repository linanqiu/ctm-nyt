egon_krenz , the man tapped yesterday to become east_germany 's new leader , faces the same task that has_fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues : reforming a country in crisis . but unlike the other new leaders in the east_bloc , mr._krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation_'s very existence : german reunification . mr._krenz , age 52 , is known_as an old-guard ironfist , one likely_to continue the method of running a country that the berlin_wall made famous . even_if he were to change his stripes and become another milton friedman , however , he would still stand a good chance of losing a country . mr._krenz almost_certainly will_be a younger version of erich honecker , his rigid predecessor as dictator . mr._krenz has followed much the same career path as mr._honecker : both spent years overseeing the freie deutsche jugend , the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for stamping young germans into socialist citizens . more recently , mr._krenz has_been in charge of east_german security , and is the youngest member of the ruling politburo . faced_with another mr._honecker , so_many despairing east_germans are_likely to flee that the two german peoples will get their reunification , de facto , on west_german ground . but if east_germany 's arthritic politburo does loosen up enough to permit mr._krenz to make serious efforts at reform , he will face a challenge just as fundamental . abandoning socialism means abandoning the east_german state 's reason for existence , and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its wall . in this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the federal republic could avoid being pulled into some_kind of tie -- economic , federal or stronger -- with west_germany . mr._krenz may need a_bit of time to consolidate his empire , which would do a_lot 0 to_promote reunification scenario one . cartoonists in west_germany have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by mr._honecker : `` wanted : one people . '' the west_german embassies in prague , budapest and warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates . of course east_germany , true to its tradition , could tighten its borders yet further . two of the last gestures of the honecker regime were to close the border to czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier . but with world-wide opinion -- even , apparently in moscow -- against east_germany , the country would_have to turn itself into an albania to clamp down further on refugees . there have_been some reports that mr._krenz is moving to `` soften '' his_reputation , notably rumors_that it was he who kept east_germany 's state police off protesters ' backs at the country 's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier_this month . but even_if he effects a hyde-to-jekyll transformation , he will face a serious ideological crisis and reunification scenario two . the problem is one that east_germany shares with other half-states , such_as north korea , but one 0 it must shoulder alone in the east_bloc . when poland moves to reform , it can at_least lean on its past : however flawed and short-lived joseph pilsudski 's interwar republic , it was a nonsocialist democracy . czech reformers can recall the wilsonian ideals of the same_period in their country . even the soviet_union has peter the great 0 to rediscover , should it choose to . but east_germany is merely `` the land of truly existing socialism . '' beyond that , it has to compete_with west_germany for a claim to the german identity . up to now , the main weapon of the `` worker and peasant state '' has_been the ideology of socialism . with talk today of a second economic miracle in west_germany , east_germany no_longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league . without moscow 's military and party behind it , east_germany runs the risk of disintegrating . if it goes capitalist , and increases trade with west_germany , it will convert itself , willy-nilly , into an economic annex of the federal republic . there 's a certain cruel logic at work here : it 's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced karl marx should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its_own people as controls . there may_be forces that would delay this scenario . ideologues are the last 0 to surrender , and germans are an ideological people . the protesters who greeted mikhail_gorbachev at east_berlin 's airport earlier_this month were n't shouting `` go u.s.a '' -- they_were chanting `` gorby , help us . '' ideologues on the other_side of the border can also slow the process . helmut_kohl 's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the west_german constitution by making more_than 500,000 people of german descent automatic citizens this_year alone . but within the government and in the think tanks outside it , many west germans maintain that they do_n't want immediate reunification . politically , this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring france . but it would_be ironic if germany 's reunification , just like its division , eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than bonn and berlin . in a statement that was as close as east_germany gets to practicing `` glasnost '' , otto reinhold , an east_german party theorist , actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma . `` the main problem , '' mr. reinhold said_0 in an east_german radio interview monitored by radio_free europe in munich , stems_from the fact_that `` the gdr is different '' from other east european states . `` what kind_of right to exist , '' he asked , `` would a capitalist german democratic republic have alongside a capitalist federal republic ? '' that 's a question 0 east_germany ca_n't answer easily , no_matter what its new leader does . miss shlaes is editorial features editor of the wall_street journal\/europe .
