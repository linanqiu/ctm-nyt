at_least 10 states are resisting drexel_burnham lambert_inc. 's nationwide effort 0 to_settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try_to revoke the firm 's license 0 to sell securities within their borders . the reluctance of some states 0 to let drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts_to polish its image after its guilty_plea to six felonies last_month , say_0 several people_familiar with the discussions . up to now , drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of puerto_rico . just yesterday , new_hampshire announced 0 it made a $ 75,000 settlement with drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . these states have_been entering into settlements with drexel as_part of the firm 's efforts 0 to operate freely anywhere in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted felon . but individuals_familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say_0 the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including new_jersey , new_york , california , pennsylvania , connecticut and missouri . officials in some of these states say_0 they do_n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel . they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many_small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . drexel has to_settle with state securities regulators in the wake_of its criminal guilty_plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange_commission that includes payment of $_650 million in penalties . these stem_from a two-year federal investigation of insider_trading and securities fraud on_wall street . ohio , the district of columbia , tennessee and illinois have_been less resistant to drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused_to settle so_far , say_0 those familiar_with the discussions . drexel says_0 it_does n't_expect 0 any of its state brokerage licenses will_be revoked , and even_if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt . it already_has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities_firms do_n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such_as investment_banking . still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could_be a burden because it must_be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could_be involved . securities regulators praise drexel for its energetic effort , led_by government-approved general_counsel saul s. cohen , 0 to_settle its legal problems with the states . but they disagree about the message 0 these settlements give to the public . `` there was a_lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said susan bryant , oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the north_american securities administrators association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with drexel . the question , she said_0 , is whether drexel should_be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -lrb- simply -rrb- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . '' while ms. bryant 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $_25,000 , she said : ``_i do_n't have any argument with those_who came to different conclusions . i can see both_sides . '' similarly , alfred rubega , new_hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said_0 his state had n't received any complaints about drexel , so it really could_n't press the issue . still , ``_i understand the reasons '' that other_states are holding out , he said_0 . mr. cohen , the drexel general_counsel , said , ``_i do_n't think , as we say in investment_banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we_'ll be losing any licenses . '' asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` there_are states that have asked for additional_information , which we are providing to them . '' mr. cohen said_0 more_than $_2.8 million has_been paid to 26 states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million . by the end of this_week , drexel should have another three to four settlements , mr. cohen said . `` the rate 0 we_'re going , i_think that by the end of the month , we_'re looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said . that total would_be important for drexel . the investment_bank has previously_announced that as_part of its punishment it would_create an_independent foundation 0 to_promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . a proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next_tuesday . there_are , according_to several securities commissioners , at_least 16 states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who do_n't appear opposed to settling . drexel 's proposed state fines have_been based_on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state . new_jersey , for_example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused . the state is n't ruling out revoking drexel 's brokerage license . the state can also bar drexel as an investment_adviser . state officials wo_n't describe their position in detail , but james mclelland smith , state securities chief , said : ``_we really are still looking_at it and have informed -lrb- drexel -rrb- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' connecticut already_has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke drexel 's brokerage license . it is one of the states that have met_with mr. cohen and asked for additional_information about investors_' accounts and other matters . `` this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state banking commissioner howard brown said . a banking department spokesman added : `` commissioner brown does_n't feel 0 that money alone is the issue here . '' particularly touchy are the cases of new_york , which is drexel 's base , and california , the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties . neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo_n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . but drexel has made it clear 0 it could mount a significant legal_battle in each state if its license is revoked , according_to state officials . ms. bryant , the head of the state securities group , said_0 drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than e.f. hutton did after its guilty_plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several_years ago . still , she said_0 , drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . `` this process should point_out that it 's not_going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back_into the retail business , '' ms. bryant said . ``_we need to have somebody worried so they do_n't do this again . '' these are the 26 states , including the commonwealth of puerto_rico , that have settled with drexel : alaska , arkansas , delaware , georgia , hawaii , idaho , indiana , iowa , kansas , kentucky , maine , maryland , minnesota , mississippi , new_hampshire , new_mexico , north dakota , oklahoma , oregon , south_carolina , south dakota , utah , vermont , washington , wyoming and puerto_rico .
