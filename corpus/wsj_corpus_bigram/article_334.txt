when last we left him , fbi agent nick mancuso had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a washington political scandal , and racked_up some pretty_good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` favorite son . '' what next for the crusty fbi agent with the heart of gold ? a spinoff series , of course . there_are plenty_of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable orphans . a den mother raising some lovable teen models . a bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards . in that context , robert loggia 's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most . week by week on `` mancuso fbi '' -lrb- nbc , fridays , 10 p.m . et -rrb- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the fbi . over the first few_weeks , `` mancuso fbi '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack_of imagination , or both . the opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -lrb- a la john tower -rrb- . when his secretary is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , mancuso is called in to investigate . last_week , a young black girl claimed 0 she had_been raped by a white police officer -lrb- a la tawana brawley -rrb- . in this_week 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility -lrb- a la rocky flats -rrb- . along the way , we_'re introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -lrb- randi brazen -- her real name , honest -rrb- , a scheming young boss -lrb- fredric lehne -rrb- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -lrb- lindsay frost -rrb- , and a forensics expert -lrb- charles siebert -rrb- . if all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists : the usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime . -lrb- in last_week 's rape case , for_example , the girl turns_out to have_been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -rrb- most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of mancuso . what makes the veteran fbi man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil_rights movement back in the 1960s . he was n't protecting the freedom marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives . this is not the `` mississippi burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` kid , you_'ve been reading classic comics too_long , '' mancuso says . `` back in 1964 , the fbi had five black agents . three were chauffeurs for j. edgar hoover , and two cleaned his house . '' at the core of mr. loggia 's mancuso is his world-weary truculence . he describes a reporter as `` miss first_amendment . '' he describes a drowned corpse as `` esther williams . '' and when he 's told `` try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back ``_i 'm_going home to try a little linguine . '' yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the american way . he 's the kind_of guy_who rescues trampled flags . if `` mancuso fbi '' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw : it 's wildly overwritten . executive producers steve sohmer and jeff bleckner -lrb- and writer\/producers ken solarz and steve bello -rrb- have revved this show up to the breaking point . to start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` what if the press gets a hold of this ? '' at_least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans . at_least once mancuso 's boss yells `` in here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down : `` you are a dinosaur ... a hangover in a $ 10 suit ... one more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . '' finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : ``_i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy , you_'ll be chasing stolen cars in anchorage . '' in fact , throughout `` mancuso fbi , '' we_do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches . witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : `` ... a dream that the planet could_be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try_to tear down every decent man_who raises his voice . '' and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` how the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician . `` you twist people 's trust . you built your career on prejudice and hate . the scars will_be here years after the polls close . '' in each show , mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : `` where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ? you_'re the real criminal here ... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . '' and , at_least once a show , someone delivers the line `` get off that soapbox . '' now that 's advice 0 the writers should take to heart . they have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they_'re ruining it . why , when a key witness disappears , does mancuso trash her apartment , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ? it 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz . that 's not plot . that 's not character . that 's hyperventilating . there_is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner david . asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries_to talk , but he 's too choked up 0 to get the words out . he bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away . it was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and robert loggia 's acting resonated in the silence . there 's a pretty_good program inside all the noise of `` mancuso fbi . '' if the show 's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it .
