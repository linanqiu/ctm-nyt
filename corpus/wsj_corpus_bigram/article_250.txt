crude_oil futures_prices fell further as analysts and traders_said 0 opec oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first_quarter . in trading on the new_york mercantile_exchange , the u.s. benchmark west_texas intermediate crude fell 39_cents a_barrel to $ 19.76 for december_delivery . petroleum products prices also declined . analysts pointed to reports that the organization of petroleum exporting_countries is producing substantially more_than its official limit of 20.5 million_barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million_barrels a day . that level of production did_n't take its toll on futures_prices for the fourth_quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . but because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market_participants say_0 , opec production will have to decline to_keep prices from eroding further . the group plans to meet in a month to_discuss production strategy for early 1990 . with prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major phillips_petroleum co. chemical facility on the houston ship channel also was bearish for prices . even_though such facilities use a relatively_small amount of crude , analysts_say 0 , now the facility wo_n't need any , at a time of already high availability . the phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . a company official said_0 the explosions began when a seal blew out . dozens_of workers were_injured , authorities said_0 . there was no_immediate estimate of damage from the company . some petroleum futures traders_say 0 technical considerations now will_help to put downward pressure_on futures_prices . for_instance , one_trader said that prices inevitably will_go lower now that they_'ve fallen below $ 20 a_barrel . `` our technician is a little bearish now that we_'ve taken out $ 20 , '' he said . in other_commodity markets yesterday : copper : the selling that started on friday continued yesterday . the december_contract fell 3.85 cents_a pound to $ 1.1960 . london metal exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric_tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late_last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . the new_york market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked_up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further_declines -- moved in . fund selling also picked_up at that point . according_to bernard savaiko , senior commodity analyst_at painewebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts . this activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling . mr._savaiko noted_that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the u.s. copper market . such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong british_pound to buy copper in new_york . `` the sell-off would probably have_been worse if the dollar had_been strong , '' he said . copper has_been stuck in a trading range of $_1.19 to $ 1.34 . mr._savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will_be about $_1.04 . precious_metals : platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold_fusion experiments , which use both metals , showed signs of producing extra heat . january_platinum closed_down $ 2.80 an_ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $_4 above its low for the day . december palladium was off $_1.55 an_ounce at $ 137.20 . platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $_130 . some traders were thought to be waiting_for the auto sales report , which will_be released today . such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters . mr._savaiko theorized that the news on cold_fusion did_n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories . he said_0 the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again . also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the soviet_union . many analysts_believe that the soviets ' thirst for dollars this_year 0 to buy grain and other western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very_much . grains and soybeans_: prices_closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news . on the chicago_board of trade , soybeans for november_delivery closed_at $ 5.63 a_bushel , down half a cent , while the december wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a_bushel . supporting prices was the announcement late_friday of additional grain sales to the soviet_union . but acting as a drag_on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this_week over much of the farm belt . strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices . sugar : world prices tumbled , mostly from their_own weight , according_to analysts . the march contract ended at 13.79 cents_a pound , down 0.37 cent . for the past_week or so , traders have_been expecting india to buy between 150,000 and 200,000_tons of refined sugar , and there have_been expectations of a major purchase by japan . but with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said_0 , futures_prices became vulnerable . developing_countries such_as india , some_analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . but erik dunlaevy , a sugar analyst_with balfour maclaine international_ltd. , said_0 the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : speculators , he said_0 , `` got too_long too_soon and ran_into resistance around the old contract highs . '' a painewebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric_tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely_to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country . cocoa : futures rallied modestly . the december_contract rose $ 33 a metric_ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day . gill & duffus ltd. , a british cocoa-trading house , estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would_be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous_year . market technicians were encouraged_by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies . recent prices for cocoa have_been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s . at such prices , according_to mr._savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon . but mr._savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level . he also_noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might_have helped cocoa in new_york as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move . sandra kaul , research analyst_at shearson_lehman hutton , said_0 the market pushed higher mainly in_anticipation of a late harvest in the ivory_coast , a major cocoa producer .
