when westinghouse_electric corp. shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in lester , pa. , three_years ago , it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business . but now westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand_for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers . and with its new venture with japan 's mitsubishi heavy_industries ltd. , announced last_week , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas . for the first_time since the mid-1970s , westinghouse this_year has seen a significant increase in orders for power_plants . most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and westinghouse believes_0 it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six_years . analysts agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost westinghouse 's bottom_line in coming years . `` westinghouse 's earnings could_be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , ''_says russell l. leavitt , of salomon_brothers inc . the company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the u.s. over the next decade . already this_year , it has received orders for four 150-megawatt advanced combustion turbines from florida power & light co. and for two 300-megawatt plants from intercontinental energy corp. , among_others . westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing . in the past , the company usually took token equity positions in power_plants 0 it supplied as a `` kicker '' to close deals . but last_june 's annnouncement that westinghouse would put_up all of the $_70 million 0 to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age . westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the southern_california edison_co. and backup power and steam to the u.s. borax & chemical co . ``_we have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an_independent producer depending_on whether we_'re the developer or just the supplier , ''_says theodore stern , executive_vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group . at the same_time , westinghouse hopes 0 its venture with mitsubishi will_help fend_off growing competition , particularly in the u.s. , from such european competitors as asea_brown boveri ag , siemens ag , and british general_electric co . under the agreement , westinghouse will_be able_to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its japanese partner , and package and sell them with its_own generators and other equipment . westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with misubishi , giving it an edge in developing asian markets . in_addition , the two_companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such_as the plants ordered by florida power , and even utilize each_other 's plants at times to take_advantage of currency fluctuations . `` even_though we_'ll still compete against mitsubishi , we_can also work jointly on some projects , and we_'ll gain a_lot of sourcing flexibility , '' mr. stern contends . the westinghouse-mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction , circumventing any possible antitrust concerns . westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement because the justice_department earlier_this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint_venture with asea_brown boveri . it is_expected that the current surge in demand_for new power will_be filled primarily by independent producers which , unlike utilities , are n't regulated and therefore do_n't need government approval to construct new plants . westinghouse expects about_half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at_least the next six_years . despite shutdowns of the company 's lester and east pittsburgh plants , the company believes_0 it has sufficient capacity 0 to meet near-term demand with its much_smaller and more_efficient manufacturing facilities in north_carolina . still , westinghouse acknowledges_that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such_as natural_gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities , which have_been pressured by regulators to_keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity . even_if that scenario occurs , westinghouse figures 0 it is prepared . the company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear_power even_though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade . john_c. marous , chairman and chief_executive officer , says_0 he_expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's ap600 nuclear_power plant , which is under development . `` once we see an order , we_expect 0 it 'll_be on line by 2000 .
