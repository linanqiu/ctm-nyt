switzerland 's most famous raider says_0 he is n't one . werner k. rey believes_0 fortunes are made by being friendly . and in little more_than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same_time rocking the staid swiss business community with some u.s.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old mr._rey has_grown from a modest banker to a billionaire . he achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established european companies . his latest coup : september 's masterminding of the five billion swiss-franc -lrb- $ 3.07 billion -rrb- merger between adia s.a. , the world 's_second-largest temporary employment agency , and inspectorate international s.a. , a rey-controlled product-inspection company . shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two_companies in late_november . but approval is almost_certain since mr._rey and a friendly adia management are in control . after the transaction , mr._rey estimates 0 the value of his 20_% stake_in the new company , 0 to be held by his omni holding ag , will_be about 1_billion swiss_francs . this will_be his return on an original investment of between 50_million swiss_francs and 80_million swiss_francs . mr._rey bought a controlling stake_in inspectorate for 18 million_swiss francs in 1982 , building up the little-known engineering company with european and u.s. acquisitions . ``_i like to succeed , ''_says mr._rey during a recent morning of working at home , which he also likes . home is an estate with green meadows opening onto lake geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the french alps . in the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers . there_is a small renoir on the wall . zurich-based magazine bilanz lists mr._rey as having a fortune of about 1.5_billion swiss_francs . writes bilanz : `` no_one in switzerland ever came so_far so fast ... he was simply the first in this_country 0 to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked_up . in short : rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets . '' however , the swiss financial press in general , as_well as many analysts , have had a hard time making up their minds about mr._rey and his un-swiss ways . for switzerland 's most prestigious newspaper , neue zuercher zeitung , mr._rey seems destined to remain the `` former bally raider , '' an image that has proved hard 0 to overcome . in 1976 , as an upstart in the eyes of switzerland 's establishment , mr._rey laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on bally , the country 's traditional shoemaker . sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in london , where he was working as a financial consultant , he learned that a large packet of bally 's shares was up for sale . looking into bally , he could hardly believe what he saw : a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major european cities and a market_capitalization of 28 million_swiss francs ; it had 7,000 employees . investing four million_swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million_swiss francs from his parents and his_wife , mr._rey acquired 20_% of bally 's shares . but such tactics were alien to switzerland in 1976 , and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain . eventually , mr._rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker oerlikon-buehrle holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys ' network . mr._rey made 50_million swiss_francs on the sale . `` bally was not an unfriendly takeover , '' he insists . buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible , mr._rey contends_0 . ``_i bought from willing shareholders . '' nevertheless , mr._rey has_been very careful since_then to make_sure 0 his moves are welcome . and he has worked to shed his raider image . in 1979 , his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works selve , based in thun . with the nonferrous metals business undermined in switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs , this looked_like a dull undertaking . but mr._rey brought about a merger in the next_few years between the country 's major producers ; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry . three_years later , machinery producer ateliers de constructions mecaniques de vevey s.a. was to become part_of the rey empire . once_again the company 's future looked less_than rosy . but after restructuring under new management , the profits began rolling in . a major boost to mr._rey 's respectability among the swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60_% of his phibro bank to the conservative swiss cantonal banks . they renamed it swiss cantobank and are using it to_expand abroad . in 1987 , mr._rey bested leading publishing houses to take_over switzerland 's jean frey ag , a major producer of magazines and newspapers . and with the recent acquisition of 30_% of winterthur-based machinery manufacturer gebrueder sulzer ag , mr._rey has enjoyed the status of white_knight . sulzer preferred him to financier tito tettamanti , whose secretive raid on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle . meanwhile , as such strategic investments have mounted , the merchant-banking arm of mr._rey 's omni holding has_been busily buying and selling dozens_of companies , often after a financial or corporate restructuring . today , this branch of mr._rey 's empire runs under the name omnicorp offering services and handles mergers and acquisitions , placement of securities and real_estate . in its portfolio are such diverse companies as united kingdom-based air europe ; checkrobot inc. , a u.s. company that makes supermarket checkout machines ; norment industries , a u.s. manufacturer of securities systems ; com systems_inc. , a u.s. regional telephone company ; and major real-estate projects in the u.s. and europe . for financial analysts , reading omni 's accounts is a tough challenge . `` companies move in and out , ''_says helga kern of kk swiss investment . financial analysts note that mr._rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests . in_august , omni unexpectedly bought inspectorate 's 80_% stake_in harpener ag of west_germany , a land-rich company . the internal transaction within the rey empire puzzled harpener 's small shareholders , but analysts_say 0 it makes_sense for inspectorate-adia to focus_on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help . mr._rey says_0 the move is yet_another example of his conservatism . he_explains that companies with real_estate give `` security . '' the real_estate can_be used , he points out 0 , as guarantees for bank_loans for corporate development . he_says 0 he_wants to `` influence '' but not `` manage '' companies . ``_i do_n't want to be like -lcb- financier alan -rcb- bond and the other australians . i_do n't_want companies to be_built around me as a person . i want them to stand alone .
