-lrb- during its_centennial year , the wall_street journal will report_events of the past_century that stand as_milestones of american business_history . -rrb- tax shelters called individual_retirement accounts , or `` iras , '' were created without fanfare on sept. 2 , 1974 , but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving . that labor day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned richard_nixon as president , gerald r. ford signed the employee retirement income security act . pension reform was its main thrust . labor and business_leaders , quoted_at the white_house rose garden rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits . iras were like stepchildren there . the ira 's conception is murky . in 1972 , then treasury_secretary george shultz , with the key support of sen. carl curtis , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered . that year a four-man group headed_by william lieber in the legislation and regulations division of the office of the chief counsel for the internal_revenue service , was assigned the task of designing a plan . they used the 1962 keogh plan , a pension plan created_by a new_york congressman for the self-employed , as a partial model . this team initially called its new model personal retirement account , or `` pra . '' but it did_n't sing . so they opted for ira , naming it after ira cohen , a brilliant irs actuary who helped them . ira , himself , confirms this account . ira rules have_been changed over the years . one in 1981 raised to $_2,000 a year from $ 1,500 the amount 0 a person could put , tax-deductible , into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans . this caused an_explosion of ira promotions by brokers , banks , mutual_funds and others . but in 1986 congress sharply reduced the number_of people_who could qualify_for its benefits and ira tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth . ira account assets have_grown to about $_400 billion from $ 393 billion last_year and just $ 26 billion in 1981 .
