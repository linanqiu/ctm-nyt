the dollar_finished softer yesterday , tilted lower by continued concern about the stock_market . ``_we 're trading with a very wary eye on_wall street , '' said trevor woodland , chief corporate trader_at harris trust & savings_bank in new_york . `` no_one is willing_to place a firm bet that the stock_market wo_n't take another tumultuous ride . '' news of the major earthquake in california tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early asian trade , but most foreign-exchange dealers_said 0 they_expect the impact of the quake on financial_markets to be short-lived . despite the dollar 's lackluster performance , some foreign-exchange traders maintain that the u.s. unit remains relatively well bid . harris trust 's mr. woodland noted_that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of `` headline negatives '' in recent_weeks , including rate_increases in europe and japan , aggressive central_bank intervention , a 190-point_plunge in new_york stock_prices , an unexpectedly poor u.s._trade report and action by the federal_reserve to nudge u.s. rates lower . while mr. woodland does_n't predict a significant climb for the u.s. unit in light of recent moves in interest_rates around the world , he_noted that `` its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- `` impressively '' limited . in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8485 marks , down from 1.8667 marks_late tuesday , and at 141.45_yen , down from 142.75_yen late_tuesday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.5920 , up from $ 1.5753 late_tuesday . in tokyo_thursday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen , down from wednesday 's tokyo_close of 142.10_yen . since friday_'s dive in stock_market prices , the fed has injected reserves into the banking_system in an_effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987 's stock_market debacle . some_analysts note that after last_week 's stock_market tailspin and tuesday 's california_earthquake , it 's hard to gauge where the central_bank wants the key federal_funds rate . they say that the earthquake , by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity , has given the fed an_additional reason 0 to_keep liquidity at a high level . the fed did , in fact , execute $_1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements , the third set of repurchase orders in three_days . analysts said_0 the additional liquidity should tend_to reduce the federal_funds rate . for now , traders_say 0 the foreign_exchange market is scrutinizing both federal_funds and events on_wall street . they note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad_news from the stock_exchange . indeed , the u.s. unit edged lower as the dow_jones industrial_average dropped about 13 points in early_trading . a slight recovery in the stock_market gave currency traders confidence 0 to push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by day 's end . some dealers noted_that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock_prices could intensify following suggestions by bank of japan governor satoshi sumita that appeared to advise japanese_investors to be very careful in investing in u.s. leveraged_buy-outs . dealers suggest_that the only positive news on the horizon that could detract attention from equities transactions is september 's u.s. consumer_price data . the figures , due for release friday , are_expected to show an uptick in inflation to 4.8_% from 4.7_% in_august . if the figures show a hefty rise in inflation , they could militate against easing by the fed . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery rose $ 1.30 to $ 368.70 an_ounce in moderate_trading . estimated_volume was three million_ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong thursday , gold was at $ 368.15 an_ounce .
