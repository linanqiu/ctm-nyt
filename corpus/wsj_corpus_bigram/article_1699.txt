medical scientists are starting to uncover a_handful of genes which , if damaged , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer . scientists say_0 the discovery of these genes in recent_months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops . an emerging understanding of the genes is_expected to produce an_array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention . that is for the future . already , scientists are developing tests based_on the newly identified genes that , for the first_time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is_likely to get cancer . `` it 's a super-exciting set of discoveries , ''_says bert vogelstein , a johns_hopkins university researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon_cancer . `` only a decade_ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level . today , we_know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . '' scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors , or simply anti-cancer genes . when functioning normally , they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check . but if the genes are damaged -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- their growth-suppressing proteins no_longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant . the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early_1980s called oncogenes . oncogenes must_be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found them in normal as_well as in cancerous cells , suggesting_that oncogenes do_n't cause cancer by themselves . in recent_months , researchers have come to believe_0 the two types_of cancer genes work in concert : an oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has_been damaged . like all genes , tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies , one from each parent . either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copies must_be impaired . a person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged early in life , is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop . emerging genetic tests will_be able_to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals , ushering in what some scientists believe_0 is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis . bill and bonnie quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings . the dedham , mass. , couple knew even_before bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50_% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma , an_eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births . mr. quinlan , 30_years old , knew 0 he carried a damaged gene , having lost an_eye to the rare tumor when he was only two_months old -- after his_mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby . because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene , it became possible last january to find_out what threat the quinlan baby faced . a test using new `` genetic probes '' showed that little will quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer . `` it made our new year , ''_says mr. quinlan . this test was the first 0 to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer . equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth , made by a boston doctor named thaddeus dryja , has opened a field of cancer study , which in recent_months has exploded . `` it turns_out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer , ''_says samuel broder , director of the national_cancer institute . `` all this may_not be obvious to the public , which is concerned_about advances in treatment , but i_am convinced 0 this basic research will_begin showing results there soon . '' to date , scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors . dr. dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986 . then last_spring , researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which , if impaired , turns healthy colon cells cancerous . soon_after that report , two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers . colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200,000 americans a year . right_now about a dozen laboratories , in the u.s. , canada and britain , are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes . they have about seven candidates . researchers_say 0 the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes , alone or in combination , appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix . there_is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes , they_are especially prone to cancer , perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem to haunt certain families . the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician named alfred g. knudson jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed_from two_separate genetic defects . he theorized that in the eye cancer , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other . the tumor , he suggested 0 , developed when the second , normal copy also was damaged . but there was no_way 0 to prove dr. knudson 's `` two-hit '' theory . back then , scientists had no_way of ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes . occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible . dr. knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. 13 from a parent who had had the disease . under a microscope he could actually see that a_bit of chromosome 13 was missing . he assumed 0 the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer . but he did_n't know which gene or genes had disappeared . then , a scientific team led_by molecular geneticist webster cavenee , then at the university of utah , found the answer . the team used a battery of the newly developed `` gene probes , '' snippets of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell . by analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors , they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome . the finding riveted medicine . it was the first_time 0 anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could_lead to the eruption of a cancer . `` it was extraordinarily satisfying , ''_says dr. knudson , now at fox chase cancer research_center in philadelphia . ``_i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would_be true for all cancers . '' it was an audacious claim . but in baltimore , dr._vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at johns_hopkins medical school , believed 0 dr. knudson was right , and set out to repeat the cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers . his was one of two research teams in 1984 0 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called wilm 's tumor . dr._vogelstein next turned his attention to colon_cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung_cancer . he believed 0 colon_cancer might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on cancer suppressor genes , because it often seems to develop in stages . it often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel , which in some_cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might_be occurring . dr._vogelstein and a doctoral student , eric fearon , began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching_for signs of genetic damage . they began uncovering a confusing variety_of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells . gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged . if both copies of a certain gene were knocked_out , benign polyps would develop . if both copies of a second gene were then deleted , the polyps would progress to malignancy . it was clear that more_than one gene had to be damaged for colon_cancer to develop . their report galvanized other molecular biologists . `` it was the confirming evidence 0 we all needed that -lcb- gene -rcb- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , ''_says ray white at howard hughes medical institute in salt lake city . but dr._vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damaged , flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy . they focused_on chromosome 17 . for months the johns_hopkins researchers , using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 , looking_for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells . such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene . when they found it last winter , dr._vogelstein was dubious that the search was over . his doubts stemmed_from the fact_that several_years earlier a princeton university researcher , arnold levine , had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones . the deletion 0 dr._vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 . but mr. levine had said_0 the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth , whereas the johns_hopkins scientists were looking_for a gene that suppressed growth . despite that , when the johns_hopkins scientists compared the gene 0 they had found in the human cancer cells with the mr. levine 's p53 gene they found 0 the two were identical ; it turned_out that in mr. levine 's cancer studies , he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene . the discovery `` suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , ''_says 0 robert weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at whitehead institute in cambridge , mass . evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too . researchers in edinburgh , scotland , have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies . the scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families , the gene , when inherited in a damaged form , may predispose women to the cancer . the p53 gene has just been implicated in lung_cancer . in a report out last_week , john minna and colleagues at the national_cancer institute say that about_half the cells taken from lung_cancer tissue 0 they tested are missing this gene . there also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney , brain and skin cancers . at the same_time , the johns_hopkins team and others are_rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes . dr._vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in colon_cancer . ray white in utah and walter bodmer , a researcher in great_britain , are close to finding another gene involved with some types_of colon_cancer , thought to be on chromosome 5 . dr. minna believes_0 people_who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung_cancer . recently , he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers , as_well as several other more common cancers , too . where these discoveries will lead , scientists can only speculate . already two major pharmaceutical companies , the squibb unit of bristol-myers_squibb co. and hoffmann-la roche inc. , are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies . some researchers_say 0 new cancer drugs 0 to slow or reverse tumor growth may_be based_on the suppressor proteins normally produced_by the genes . the idea would_be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes . it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions , though no_one has come close to doing that so_far . in any_case , says_0 dr. minna of the national_cancer institute , ``_we 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most_important steps in the genesis of cancer .
