unisys corp. 's announcement friday of a $ 648.2 million loss for the third_quarter showed that the company is moving even faster_than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare_for a turnaround next_year . at the same_time , the sheer size of the loss , coupled_with a slowing of orders , made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will_be at the computer_maker and defense-electronics concern . `` unisys is getting clobbered . just clobbered , '' said ulric weil , an_analyst at weil &_associates who had once been high on the company . `` the quarter was terrible , and the future looks anything but encouraging . '' unisys , whose revenue inched up 3.7_% in the quarter to $ 2.35 billion from $ 2.27 billion in the year-earlier_quarter , had an operating loss of about $ 30 million . on top of that , the blue bell , pa. , concern took a $ 230 million charge_related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees . that is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that unisys said a month ago 0 would_be laid off . unisys said_0 that should_help it save $_500 million a year in costs , again at the high end of the previously_reported range of $_400 million to $_500 million . the company also took a write-off of $_150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts , as some new managers took a hard look_at the prospects_for that slow-growing business . in_addition , unisys set_up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $ 60 million to $_70 million -- to cover the minimum amount 0 it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal . unisys also_noted that it paid $ 78.8 million in taxes during the quarter , even_though tax payments normally would_be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss . the tax payments will leave unisys with $_225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters . in_addition , unisys said_0 it reduced computer inventories a further $_100 million during the quarter , leaving it within $_100 million of its goal of a reduction of $_500 million by the end of the year . still , unisys said_0 its european business was weak during the quarter , a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the u.s. over the past_several quarters . the company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the unix operating_system . that would_be a huge problem if it were to continue , because unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away_from using operating_systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines . in_addition , unisys must deal_with its increasingly oppressive debt_load . debt has_risen to around $_4 billion , or about 50_% of total capitalization . that means 0 unisys must_pay about $_100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred_stock . jim unruh , unisys 's president , said_0 he is approaching next_year with caution . he said_0 the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does_n't see much revenue growth in the cards . he also said that the price_wars flaring up in parts of the computer_industry will_continue through next_year . he said_0 the move toward standard operating_systems means 0 customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down . that , he said_0 , is why unisys is overhauling its whole business : it needs to prepare_for a world in which profit_margins will_be lower_than computer companies have_been used to . ``_we 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental_change 0 the industry is going through , '' mr. unruh said . `` the information-systems industry is still going_to be a high-growth business , and we_'re confident_that we have tremendous assets as a company . but we_do n't minimize the challenges of the near_term . '' securities analysts were even more cautious , having been burned repeatedly on unisys this_year . some had predicted earnings of more_than $_4 a_share for this_year , up from last_year 's fully_diluted $ 3.27 a_share on earnings of $ 680.6 million . but the company said friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first_nine months , compared_with earnings a year_earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a_share fully_diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion . and unisys is_expected to do little better_than break even in the fourth_quarter . so steve milunovich at first_boston said_0 he is cutting his earnings_estimate for next_year to $_2 a_share from $_3 . ``_i was feeling like i was too_high to begin with , '' he said . mr. weil of weil &_associates said_0 he will_remain at $_1 a_share for next_year but said_0 he wonders whether even that low target is at risk . `` the break-even point for next_year is much lower , but is it low enough ? '' he asked . reflecting the concern , unisys stock fell a further 75_cents to $ 16.25 in composite_trading friday on the new_york stock_exchange .
