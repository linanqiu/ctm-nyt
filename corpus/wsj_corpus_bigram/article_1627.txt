'' the employment_report , which will provide the first official measure of the economy 's strength in october , is_expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs . other key economic_indicators due this_week include today 's release of the september leading_indicators index and new-home sales . tomorrow , the october purchasing_managers report is due and on thursday comes october chain-store sales . despite yesterday 's modest bond_market gains , economists say_0 investors are anxious about the treasury 's huge quarterly refunding of government debt , the timing of which depends_on congressional efforts to raise the debt_ceiling . although the treasury will_announce details of the november refunding tomorrow , it could_be delayed if congress and president_bush fail to increase the treasury 's borrowing capacity . the debt_ceiling is_scheduled to fall to $_2.8 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion at_midnight tonight . the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond rose 1\/8 point . mortgage-backed_securities were up less_than 1\/8 point and investment-grade_corporate bonds were_unchanged . strong_demand for new_york city 's $ 813 million general_obligation bonds

long-term tax-exempt new_york city bonds were among the highest , as a percentage of treasury rates , for any new_york city issue in recent memory . a spokesman for new_york city comptroller harrison

was 7.62 % . those rates are up from 7.52_% and 7.50_% , respectively , at last_week 's auction . due to the treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt expires at_midnight tonight , yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales . the treasury_bills sold yesterday settle today , rather_than the standard settlement day of thursday . and because of the early settlement , the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity , and the six-month_bills have an 184-day maturity . because of the early settlement , the federal_reserve
