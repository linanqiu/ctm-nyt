some house democrats are trying_to head_off an appointment by president_bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan_bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself . four democrats on the house_banking committee sent president_bush a letter stating their concerns_about the expected appointment of james simmons , an arizona banker and former fund-raiser for mr._bush , to the oversight board of the resolution_trust corp . the oversight board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in_august , sets policy for the rtc , which will sell hundreds_of the nation_'s sick_thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets . treasury_secretary nicholas_brady , federal_reserve board chairman_alan greenspan and housing and urban_development secretary_jack kemp are members of the board . president_bush must appoint two other members , one a democrat and one a republican . an administration official confirmed last_week that mr._simmons , the chairman of valley_national bank in phoenix , is the republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under_way . the democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said_0 . mr._simmons declined to comment , and the white_house said_0 the congressmen 's letter is under_review . the letter , dated last_thursday , cited the losses at valley_national , and at united bank , also of phoenix , where mr._simmons was chairman for 29 years . both banks have_been battered , as have other arizona banks , by falling real_estate prices . valley_national , for_example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of june . ``_we believe_that there_are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give_them your thorough consideration before making this key rtc appointment , '' the letter said . `` the rtc needs the most able , competent management available . '' but mr._simmons has long ties to both republicans and banking . he was co-chairman of mr._bush 's arizona campaign committee in last_year 's election , and also worked for mr._bush in the 1980 election . the two met more_than 30_years ago , when mr._simmons worked for commercial bank &_trust co. of midland , texas , where mr._bush was an organizing director . in 1986 , mr._simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed_by william seidman , chairman of the federal_deposit insurance corp. and the resolution_trust corp . that committee determined to open arizona to banking across state lines . arizona trend magazine referred to mr._simmons this_year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state . the letter to mr._bush was signed by reps. bruce vento -lrb-_d. , minn. -rrb- , the chairman of the banking_committee 's rtc task_force , thomas mcmillen -lrb-_d. , md. -rrb- , kweisi mfume -lrb-_d. , md . -rrb- and paul kanjorski -lrb-_d. , pa . -rrb- .
