'' timex is a major u.s. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the philippines and other developing nations covered_by the u.s. tariff preferences . u.s._trade officials said_0 the philippines and thailand would_be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action . imports of the types_of watches that now will_be eligible_for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a relatively_small share of the $_1.5 billion in u.s. watch imports that year , according_to an_aide to u.s._trade representative_carla hills .
