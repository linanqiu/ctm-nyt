'' not all the scandal-tripped have enjoyed soft landings . but many have . `` these people bounce_back more resiliently than regular people , ''_says washington writer suzanne garment , who is working on a history of post-watergate scandal . given their_own penchant for book writing , it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art . for there_is an emerging protocol -- indeed , an etiquette -- to it . among the rules : pretend 0 nothing happened as if he were still in his old job , mr. wright , by resigning with his title instead of being forced from his job , by law enjoys a $ 120,000 annual office expense allowance , three paid staffers , up to $ 67,000 for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege . not to mention a generous federal pension . there_is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $_10,000 a pop , at tony places including the yale political union . `` he 's as busy as he was as speaker , '' reports mr. wright 's administrative aide , larry shannon . atone on the edge of fashionable georgetown , in a chic office with a river view and a number_of corporate clients whom he wo_n't name , mr._deaver is trying_to reclaim his_reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town . there_are few mementos of his days as white_house deputy chief of staff and confidant of ronald and nancy reagan . the former $_3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics . ``_i feel better_than i ever have in my_life , '' he_says . mr._deaver confessed to his alcoholism during his trial on perjury charges . he is also a recovering workaholic , relaxing with his family and creating topiary , or garden-shrub sculpture , a fashionable pursuit for which he developed a passion during his three-year legal ordeal . one sign of mr._deaver 's renaissance : an appearance on abc 's `` nightline '' for a show on pack journalism . host ted koppel introduced him as `` the media master of the reagan_administration , '' with nary a mention of mr._deaver 's conviction in 1987 on perjury charges . finding god `` when someone says , ` i_'ve turned to god , ' everybody lays off , '' observes frank mankiewicz , an old washington hand and former aide to robert kennedy . thus have charles colson and jeb magruder launched successful post-watergate careers at the pulpit . but it_does n't_always work so smoothly . after allegations surfaced in a 1985 divorce contest that he had beaten his_wife , sec enforcement chief john fedders retreated to a trappist monastery in rural virginia . he is now in solo law practice in washington , but his fees have_been meager and he failed in efforts to win a chunk of his ex-wife 's royalties on her tell-all book . from time to time he returns to the monastery for prayer , meditation and pro_bono legal work . mr. fedders is philosophical about his travails . `` this whole experience has_been an_opportunity for internal growth , '' he_says . he_sees a psychoanalyst five mornings a week . ``_i 've surrendered to the circumstances , '' mr. fedders says . `` the word surrender has a precise psychoanalytic meaning . my universe has_changed . i_'m enjoying my_life and who i_am today . the aspect of being a mega-lawyer is n't as important .

'' misery loves company other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace . raymond donovan , the new_jersey construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985 , only to be acquitted of fraud charges , often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear . each time 0 a new scandal hits , he_says 0 , `` it pulls the scabs off your knees . '' one of the first people 0 to come to the deaver home after his troubles erupted was former nixon aide john ehrlichman , whom mr._deaver scarcely knew . `` he reassured me that the hurricane would end , '' mr._deaver recalls . mr. bauman received an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival , richard_nixon . says mr. bauman : `` if things get really tough , i can always auction it off at sotheby_'s .
