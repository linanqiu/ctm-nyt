part_of a series -rcb- smyrna , ga. -- the auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along cobb parkway , stretching from the perimeter highway that circles atlanta to the `` big chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark . twenty years_ago , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a_handful of dealerships were here . now there_are 23 . alongside such long-familiar names as chevrolet , ford and dodge are nameplates that did_n't exist until three_years ago : acura , sterling , hyundai . under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of lexus , a luxury marque launched by toyota_motor corp. just two_months ago . the 1980s have spawned an_explosion of consumer choice in america , in everything from phone companies to colas . and especially , as the cobb parkway strip attests , in cars . americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408 when the decade began , according_to automotive news , a trade publication . for car marketers , it has_become a much tougher battle to_keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block . for american car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing . malcolm macdougall , vice_chairman of the jordan , mcgrath , case & taylor advertising agency in new_york , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . '' he_says 0 the number_of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image . `` the winners , '' he predicts , `` will_be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated_with quality and value . '' he_says 0 it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent_company 's quality image . he applauds toyota and nissan_motor co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather_than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . some auto executives believe_0 the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . `` there 's more noise out there , and the consumer may_have to work harder to cut through it , ''_says vincent p. barabba , executive_director of market research and planning at general_motors corp . `` but the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels . jeanene page , of north salt lake city , utah , likes the broader selection . she_wants something big , and already_has looked_at the chrysler new_yorker and lincoln town car . now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing 0 to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same_time . `` that seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she_says . market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far_more extensive than when alfred p. sloan jr. conceived the idea 50 years_ago . the legendary gm chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . '' now there_are many cars for every purse and purpose . just four_years ago , gm planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments . today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans . the number_of makes has mushroomed because the u.s. is the world 's_biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto_maker wants to sell here . for every brand like renault or fiat that has_been squeezed out , others such_as isuzu , daihatsu and mitsubishi have come in . detroit tries_to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its_own . gm launched the geo marque this_year 0 to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto_makers , and next_year gm 's long-awaited saturn cars will make their debut . ford_motor co. created the merkur nameplate in 1985 0 to sell its german-made touring sedans in the u.s. . but slow sales forced ford to kill the brand just last_week . when consumers have so_many choices , brand_loyalty is much harder 0 to maintain . the wall_street journal 's `` american way of buying '' survey_found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend_to switch brands . for the survey , peter_d. hart_research associates and the roper_organization each asked about 2,000 u.s. consumers about their buying habits . which cars do americans favor most these_days ? it 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor . adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury_cars , convertibles and imports far_more than their elders do . three of every 10 buyers under 30 would_prefer to buy a sports car , compared_with just 16_% of adults 30 and over , according_to the journal_survey . young consumers prefer luxury_cars by a 37 % to 28_% margin -- even_though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely_to actually purchase a luxury_car . perhaps most striking , 35_% of households headed_by people aged 18 to 44 have at_least one foreign car . that 's true of only 14_% of households headed_by someone 60 or older . generally , imports appeal most to americans who live in the west and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young . `` for many baby_boomers , buying a domestic_car is a totally foreign experience , ''_says christopher cedergren , auto-market analyst_with j.d. power &_co. of agoura hills , calif . such preferences persist even_though many americans believe_0 differences_between imported and domestic cars are diminishing . only 58 % of americans now believe_that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the journal_survey found , down from 68_% in 1987 . some 46_% give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50_% two_years ago . on the other_hand , only 42_% say_0 foreign cars are less comfortable than u.s. models , down from 55_% in 1987 . people in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger americans are to brand switching . `` once buying habits are formed , they_'re very_hard 0 to break , '' declares thomas mignanelli , executive_vice president for nissan 's u.s. sales operations . but out on cobb parkway , ted negas sees it differently . `` the competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , ''_says mr. negas , vice_president of ed voyles oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships 0 to locate on the strip . thus the very fickleness of baby_boomers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them . the battle for customer loyalty is evident along the cobb parkway strip . ed voyles olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less_than a year old , so they get quicker service . just down the street , chris volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side . manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers . gm 's cadillac division , ignoring detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does_n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features . cadillac may_be on to something . some 60_% of the survey respondents said_0 they would buy anti-lock brakes even_if they carry a medium or high price tag . more_than 50_% felt the same way about air bags . both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . in contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . but even a little appeal has a_lot of attraction these_days . gm 's pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged v-6 engine on its grand prix model , even_though it_expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option . the reason_: items with narrow appeal can_be important in a market as fragmented as today 's . americans spent more_than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last_year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded polaroid co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion . `` even_if it 's only 1 % , ''_says gm 's mr. barabba , `` would you throw away sales the size of polaroid ? ''
