disaster states are n't jumping to raise taxes for relief and recovery . not_yet , anyway . just after hurricane_hugo battered south_carolina , some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes . gov. campbell responded , `` they_'re mentioning rope when there 's been a hanging in the family . '' a spokesman says_0 the governor believes_0 he can avoid increases by relying on federal_aid and shifting funds in state programs . still , hugo 's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals to give local_governments authority to levy sales taxes . a spokesman for north_carolina gov. martin says_0 hugo has n't prompted proposals for state or local increases . california , where earthquake_damage may top $_5 billion , plans a special legislative session . property-tax relief is_likely . legislators are talking_about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes , although gov. deukmejian says_0 they should_be a last resort . needs are n't clear , and the state constitution makes increasing taxes and spending very_difficult . but some legislators think_0 the time may_be ripe to revise the constitution . the irs will pay if its error burdens you with bank charges . policy statement p-5-39 sets out terms . as a result of an erroneous irs levy on a bank account , a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges . if the irs admits its error and the charges have_been paid , it will reimburse a taxpayer who has n't refused_to give timely answers to irs inquiries or has n't contributed_to continuing or compounding the error . the irs recently amended the policy to cover stop-payment charges for checks lost by the irs . if the irs asks for and gets a replacement for a check that it concedes 0 it lost in processing , it will reimburse the taxpayer for the stop-payment charge on the original . reimbursement claims must_be filed with the irs district or service-center director within a year after the expense accrues . if the irs seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check , you should request interest abatement , publisher prentice_hall notes 0 . just five acres more are all 0 we_need to feel really at home , they say_0 . a couple 0 we_'ll call the blandings spent nearly $ 800,000 on a 15-acre plot and main home and have an old $ 175,000 mortgage exempt_from the new limit on mortgage-interest deductions . they plan to_expand the home site by buying five adjoining acres for $_200,000 , borrowed against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized by the 15 acres . their debt will_be well under the $_1 million limit -- on borrowing to_acquire , build , or improve a home -- that qualifies for mortgage-interest deductions . as you_can guess , the blandings want to deduct home-mortgage interest on the $_200,000 loan . but , irs private ruling 8940061 notes 0 , no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence . so the irs has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer ; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence . thus , the irs says_0 , the blandings ' $_200,000 loan is home-acquisition debt , and interest on it is fully deductible . earthquake_victims facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided for hugo 's victims ; irs notice 89108 has details . notice 89-107 offers added relief for hurricane-hit concerns that must file pension and benefit-plan returns . reports of payments to independent contractors for services must_be filed by businesses , but do_n't bet that contractors ' unreported income will_be detected that way . the general accounting_office estimates that 50_% of irs audits do_n't spot companies that fail to file the reports . uh huh : a claim by peter testa of new_york that a stranger paid him $_500 to go_into a bank and change $ 44,400 in small bills into large bills `` is unconvincing , '' the tax court found 0 . it held that testa is taxable on $ 44,400 of unreported income . why be a middleman for charitable gifts ?
