the dollar posted gains against all major_currencies yesterday , buoyed_by persistent japanese demand_for u.s. bond issues . while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based_on sluggish u.s. economic_indicators , dealers note that japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the u.s._currency from plunging below key levels against the mark . at the same_time , dealers_said 0 the u.s. unit has_been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent_weeks , in part because the hefty japanese demand_for dollars has_been offset_by the mark 's strength , resulting in a stalemate . jay goldinger , with capital insight inc. , reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as_well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen_late tuesday in new_york -- the strength of the u.s. bond_market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds , rather_than mark bonds . `` dollar-yen -lcb- trade -rcb- is the driving_force in the market , '' said tom trettien , a vice_president with banque paribas in new_york , `` but i_'m not convinced 0 it will_continue . who knows what will happen down the road , in three to six_months , if foreign_investment starts to erode ? '' in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks_late tuesday , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen_late tuesday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.5755 , down from $ 1.5805 late_tuesday . in tokyo_thursday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen , up from wednesday 's tokyo_close of 143.08 yen . douglas madison , a corporate trader with bank of america in los_angeles , traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by japanese insurance_companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings . he_contends that the perception in japan of a vitriolic u.s. response to sony_corp. 's announcement of its purchase of columbia_pictures entertainment_inc. has_been temporarily mollified . he cites the recent deal between the mitsubishi_estate co. and the rockefeller_group , as_well as the possible white_knight role of an_undisclosed japanese company in the georgia-pacific corp. takeover_bid for great_northern nekoosa corp. as evidence . the forthcoming maturity in november of a 10-year japanese government yen-denominated bond_issue valued_at about $ 16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments , according_to mr. madison . it remains unclear whether the bond_issue will_be rolled over . meanwhile , traders in tokyo say that the prospect of lower u.s. interest_rates has spurred dollar buying by japanese institutions . they point_out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield u.s. treasury debt and suggest 0 demand_for the u.s. unit will_continue unabated until rates in the u.s. recede . the market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing u.s._economy , and traders note that the market in recent_weeks has_taken its cues more from wall_street than u.s. economic_indicators . dealers_said 0 the dollar merely drifted lower following the release wednesday of the u.s. purchasing_managers ' report . the managers ' index , which measures the health of the manufacturing_sector , stood_at 47.6 % in october , above september 's 46_% , and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3 % . some dealers_said 0 the dollar was pressured slightly because a number_of market_participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking_for an index above_50 , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy . but most said_0 the index had no more_than a minimal effect_on trade . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery settled_at $ 374.20 an_ounce , down 50_cents . estimated_volume was a moderate 3.5_million ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong thursday , gold was_quoted at $ 374.19 an_ounce .
