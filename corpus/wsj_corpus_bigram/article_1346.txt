when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two_weeks ago , sen. christopher dodd called the state_department for a briefing . `` they said , ` follow cnn , ' '' he told_reporters . that shows_how far ted turner 's cable_news network has come since its birth nine years_ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . it is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world . but for all its success , cnn has hit a plateau . although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . cnn executives worry_that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may_be getting stale and wo_n't keep viewers coming_back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-tv . `` just the fact 0 we_'re on 24_hours is no_longer bulletin , ''_says ed turner , cnn 's executive_vice president , news gathering -lrb- and no relation to ted turner -rrb- . `` you_ca n't live on that . '' so cnn , a unit of atlanta-based turner_broadcasting system inc. , is trying_to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . tonight , to kick off the effort , cnn will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . eastern time 0 to air head-to-head against the network newscasts . the show will_be co-anchored by bernard shaw and catherine crier , a 34-year-old former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism . the new show is perhaps the boldest in a number_of steps 0 the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away_from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . to distinguish itself , cnn is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program . it is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . and it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team . `` the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , ''_says jon petrovich , executive_vice president of headline news , cnn 's sister network . but that wo_n't be easy . networks , like other consumer_products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy 0 to change . it also takes money that cnn has_been reluctant_to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . and the cable-tv operators -- cnn 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way_0 they_are . the repositioning bid is aimed_at cnn 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive . already , cnn is facing stronger competition_from financial news_network inc. and general_electric co. 's consumer news and business channel , both of which are_likely to_pursue more general news in the future . in_addition , many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced_by local broadcast stations . cnn wants to change its viewers ' habits . its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an_average of just 26 minutes a day watching cnn , according_to audience research . that 's less_than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . the brief attention 0 viewers give cnn could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more_important to cable-tv channels . cnn 's viewer habits have_been molded by its format . its strategy in the past has_been to serve_as a tv wire service . it focused_on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took_place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks . it filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` daybreak , '' `` daywatch , '' `` newsday , '' and `` newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows . `` our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , ''_says paul amos , cnn executive_vice president for programming . accordingly , cnn is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show 0 its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says_0 mr. amos . and it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` larry king live '' and `` crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope 0 will keep people tuned in . then there 's `` the world today , '' the prime-time newscast featuring mr. shaw and ms. crier . until_now , cnn has featured its hollywood gossip show during the key evening period . but 70_% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do_so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered 0 , so cnn wants in . mr. amos says_0 the shaw-crier team will_probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at_least for now , appearing similar to cnn 's other newcasts . some in the industry are_skeptical . ``_i find it hard to conceive of people switching over to cnn for what , at_least in the public 's mind , is the same news , ''_says reuven frank , the former two-time president of nbc_news and creator of the huntley-brinkley report . the evening news is also slated as cnn 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . in_august , the network hired award-winning producer pamela hill , the former head of news specials at abc . she 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an_eye toward breaking big stories . cnn executives hope 0 the headlines created_by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way_0 `` 60 minutes '' did so well for cbs . that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are_skeptical 0 cnn will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . `` they_'ve never shown any inclination to spend money on production , ''_says michael mosettig , a senior producer with macneil-lehrer newshour , who notes that cnn is indispensable to his job . the network 's salaries have always ranged far_below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work_force . cnn recently gave most employees raises of as_much as 15_% , but they_'re still drastically underpaid compared_with the networks . says mr. mosettig : `` cnn is my wire service ; they_'re on top of everything . but to improve , they_'ve really got to make the investment in people . '' in any_case , cable-tv-system operators have reason 0 to fear any tinkering with cnn 's format . they market cable-tv on the very grazing opportunities 0 cnn seeks to discourage . ``_we would obviously be upset if those kinds_of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , ''_says robert stengel , senior_vice president , programming , of continental cablevision inc. , which_holds a 2_% stake_in turner_broadcasting .
