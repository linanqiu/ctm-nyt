the municipal bond_market is bracing_for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and two of its best customers turn_into sellers . commercial_banks and property\/casualty insurers , which together own about 36_% of all municipal_bonds , have_been dumping their securities for weeks . last_week , traders_said 0 , there_were three institutional sellers for every buyer . `` every_day we_'re getting new bid lists '' from would-be sellers , one_trader said_0 . `` most dealers can_not continue to absorb this supply . '' as a result , yields_on long-term muni bonds now stand at about 95_% of long-term_treasury yields , the highest such level in more_than two_years . `` there_is incredible negative psychology building in the market , '' said donna avedisian , a vice_president at merrill_lynch &_co . `` people are very concerned_about who is going_to step_up to the plate and buy municipal_bonds in the absence of institutional buyers . '' the yield on a group of 25 revenue_bonds compiled_by the bond buyer , a trade publication , now exceeds 7.50_% . at this_week 's new_york city bond sale , traders expect yields_on the 20-year new_york bonds to nearly match the 7.9 % yield on_30-year treasury_bonds . for an_investor in the 28_% federal tax bracket , 7.9 % tax-free is the same as 10.38 % on a taxable investment . that 's a taxable-equivalent yield nearly three percentage_points more_than the current yield on_30-year treasury_bonds . how quickly things change . this past summer , investors_' appetite_for municipal_bonds seemed insatiable . individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond_prices , making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types_of fixed-income investments during the period . but while analysts_say that municipal_bonds still offer good value , you would n't_know it by the way_0 institutional_investors are_rushing to dump their holdings . bond_market analysts_say 0 the institutional selling was_triggered by several factors . big banks such_as chemical_bank and chase_manhattan , which have_been taking heavy charges to_expand their third_world loan-loss_reserves , are n't looking_for tax-exempt income . ``_we do_n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds , '' said a spokeswoman at chemical . in recent_weeks , traders_said 0 , chemical has sold more_than $_1 billion of tax-free bonds . the spokeswoman confirmed_that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings , but could_n't immediately confirm the amount . insurance_companies are_rushing to sell before the end of the year , when some of their tax_benefits associated_with municipal_bonds will_be phased_out . there_is speculation_that property\/casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble to raise_cash 0 to pay claims related to hurricane_hugo and the northern_california earthquake . fundamental factors are at work as_well . muni bond holders are worried_about the impact of a slowing_economy on tax revenue , at a time when many state and local_governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs . the recent natural_disasters , and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure , suggests_that supply of new issues will_continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off . `` there_is just so_much going on that it 's difficult to pick just one factor that 's driving the market , '' said ronald ian heller , vice_president at first chicago capital_markets inc. , a subsidiary of first chicago corp . some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign . mutual_funds , for_example , are said to be selling existing municipal_bonds to raise_cash 0 to buy new issues . because municipal_bonds yields have_risen at a time when interest_rates generally have_fallen , some portfolio_managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond_market rebounds . ms. avedisian believes that the mutual_funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity -- those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest_rates . such bonds , she_says 0 , are those that are nearing their call date . but traders_said 0 the market 's tone could pick_up this_week if new_york city 's $ 787 million bond_offering goes well . the offering will include $ 729 million of 20-year tax-exempt_bonds and $ 57.8 million of taxable bonds . a few_weeks ago , new_york sold $_750 million of tax-exempts . new_york city bonds have_been beaten down for three straight weeks . on friday , some issues fell nearly one_point , or close to $ 10 for each $_1,000 face_amount . the sell-off in new_york city bonds was_triggered by concerns_about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election . the city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling . `` the city has issued so_much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned . they_'d like to see some other names in their_portfolios , '' said michael s. appelbaum , first vice_president at shearson_lehman hutton . but he_thinks 0 investors may_be overreacting to the market 's problems . overall , he_says 0 , municipal prices are `` very cheap '' and represent an `` excellent buying_opportunity . '' friday_'s market_activity treasury_bonds fell_sharply on confusion about this_week 's treasury debt auction and rumors_that a major japanese investor was unloading large_amounts of long-term bonds . the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond ended at a price of 102 2\/32 , down nearly 5\/8 point from thursday , or about $ 6.25 for each $_1,000 face_amount . the issue 's yield rose to 7.93_% from 7.88_% . late_thursday , the treasury said_0 it needed to raise $ 17 billion quickly and would do_so by issuing new securities this_week . credit market analysts expected the treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ 17 billion of cash management bills . instead , the treasury announced 0 it would sell $_2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $_15.6 billion of three-month and six-month_bills will_take place today , as_usual , but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of thursday . by moving the settlement date ahead , the treasury can raise money under the $ 2.87 trillion debt_ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow , after which it reverts to $_2.8 trillion . the market also was hurt_by rumors_that nippon kangyo kakumaru , a japanese brokerage_firm , was unloading some of the 30-year_bonds 0 it recently purchased . one dealer said_0 the talk was that the firm sold about $_500 million of bellwether 30-year_bonds . the firm is thought to have purchased up to $_3 billion of 30-year_bonds in a buying spree on wednesday and the previous thursday . dealers_say 0 the firm apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year_bonds by using cantor fitzgerald securities corp. as a broker . cantor provides price quotes to telerate_systems inc. , a widely_used electronic system . nippon kangyo 's moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors , many of whom decided to stay_out of the market . as a result of its large-scale buying , some_analysts now say that liquidity , or the ability_to easily buy and sell , has_been constrained in the benchmark treasury_bond issue . in other markets : -- the junk_bonds of rjr_nabisco inc. rallied friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to nestle foods_corp. for $ 370 million . the sale price , which was above wall_street expectations , sent many rjr securities up by one_point . `` it shows that there_are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today 's market , '' said robert long , managing_director and head of the high-yield research department at first_boston corp . many of the rjr securities , which had_been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session , bounced_back after the company 's announcement that it agreed_to sell its baby ruth , butterfinger and pearson candy businesses to nestle foods , a unit of the swiss-based food concern . the sale , expected to close before the end of the year , also_includes a manufacturing_plant in franklin park , ill . rjr 's subordinated discount debentures of 2001 , which traded as low as 45 friday , finished the day at 46 7\/8 . other rjr securities also closed_higher . rjr_holdings capital corp. 's 14.7 % convertible pay-in-kind securities maturing in 2009 closed 1\/2 higher at 86 1\/2 after trading as low as 85 1\/4 . most other junk_bond issues finished a quarter-point lower on rumors_that campeau_corp. was filing for protection_from creditors_under chapter_11 of the bankruptcy_code . a spokesman for campeau called the rumors `` ridiculous . '' most investment-grade_bonds fell 3\/8 to 1\/2_point . -- mortgage_securities fell 7\/32 to 8\/32 but held up better_than intermediate treasurys . dealers_said 0 some defensive investors were buyers of mortgages , as were dealers seeking collateral for remics priced earlier last_week . among major issues , government national_mortgage association 9_% securities for november_delivery ended at_98 12\/32 , down 8\/32 point for a yield of about 9.35 % to a 12-year_average life_assumption .
