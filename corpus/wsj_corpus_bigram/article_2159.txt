pwa corp. said_0 it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes 0 it acquired earlier_this year in its 248 million_canadian dollar -lrb-_us$ 211.6 million -rrb- purchase of wardair inc . pwa , which recently merged wardair 's operations with those of pwa-owned canadian airlines international_ltd. , canada 's second-biggest airline , said_0 the proposed sale is part_of a revised five-year plan aimed_at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt . pwa would n't estimate the value of wardair 's aircraft , which include 12 airbus a310-300s and three boeing 747-100s . but james ireland , a miami-based technical analyst_with avmark inc. , an aircraft evaluation firm , estimated the total `` half-life '' value of the 15 planes at about $_650 million or more . mr. ireland said_0 11 dc10-30 aircraft that pwa also said_0 it plans to sell , beginning in 1992 , have a current half-life value of about $ 34 million each , or a total $ 374 million , raising aggregate potential proceeds_from the aircraft sale to about $_1.02 billion . mr. ireland said_0 current demand_for used aircraft is strong , partly_because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists . he predicted that pwa would_have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers . under its revised fleet plan , pwa said_0 it will also increase its existing fleet of eight boeing 767-300er aircraft to 18 by 1994 , and add four more boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next_year . pwa said_0 two of the boeing 767-300er aircraft scheduled for_delivery in 1990 would_be leased out for two to five_years . pwa did_n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul , but a toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $_450 million -lrb- us -rrb- , excluding replacement costs for the 11 dc10-30 aircraft that pwa plans to sell , and purchase costs for as many as 17 airbus 320-200 aircraft that pwa previously ordered . ``_i do_n't see this as a debt reduction exercise . it 's focused_on streamlining '' pwa 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs , the analyst said_0 . pwa 's long-term_debt and capital lease obligations rose to c$ 1.24 billion at the end of the second_quarter , nearly double the year-earlier figure , reflecting debt absorbed under the wardair purchase . pwa said_0 it also expects to announce by tuesday whether it will_take delivery of all 17 airbus 320-200 aircraft 0 it previously ordered . the first five leased units were to be_delivered in 1991 .
