r. gordon mcgovern was forced out as campbell_soup co. 's president and chief_executive officer , the strongest evidence yet of the power that dorrance_family members intend_to wield in reshaping the troubled food company . herbert m. baum , the 53-year-old president of the company 's campbell u.s.a. unit , and edwin l. harper , 47 , the chief_financial officer , will run campbell as a team , dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named . the board already_has been searching_for strong outside candidates , including food-industry executives with considerable international experience . wall_street reacted favorably to mr._mcgovern 's departure and its implications . in heavy_trading on the new_york stock_exchange , campbell 's shares rose $ 3.375 to close_at $ 47.125 . `` the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better , '' said john mcmillin , a food industry_analyst for prudential-bache in new_york . mr._mcgovern was widely seen as sales , and not profit , oriented . `` new managers would think a little more like wall_street , '' mr. mcmillin added . some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover_speculation , which has contributed_to volatility of campbell shares in recent_months . campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the u.k. and italy , appear to be at the heart of its problems . growth has_fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far_below results in u.s. units . for_example , campbell is a distant third in the u.k. frozen foods market , where it recently paid 24 times earnings for freshbake foods plc and wound up with far_more capacity than it could use . similarly , campbell 's italian biscuit operation , d. lazzaroni &_co. , has_been hurt_by overproduction and distribution problems . such problems will_require considerable skill to resolve . however , neither mr._baum nor mr. harper has much international experience . mr._baum , a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with campbell employees , will have responsibility_for all domestic operations except the pepperidge farm unit . mr. harper , a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in 1986 , will_take charge of all overseas operations as_well as pepperidge . in an joint interview yesterday , both_men said_0 they would like to be the company 's next chief_executive . mr._mcgovern , 63 , had_been under intense pressure_from the board to boost campbell 's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies . the board is dominated_by the heirs of the late john t. dorrance jr. , who controlled about 58 % of campbell 's stock when he died in april . in recent_months , mr. dorrance 's children and other family_members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity . in_august , the company took a $ 343 million pretax_charge against fiscal_1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring_plan . the plan calls_for closing at_least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs . but analysts said_0 early results from the reorganization have_been disappointing , especially in europe , and there_were signs that the board became impatient . campbell officials said_0 mr._mcgovern was n't available yesterday to_discuss the circumstances of his departure . the company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying , `` the ceo succession is well along and i_'ve decided for personal_reasons to take early_retirement . '' but people_familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last_week in london said_0 mr._mcgovern was fired . mr._mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended_to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement_age of 65 in october 1991 , `` unless i get fired . '' campbell said_0 mr._mcgovern had withdrawn his_name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for nov._17 . for fiscal_1989 , mr._mcgovern received a salary of $ 877,663 . he owns_about 45,000 shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more_than 100,000 additional_shares . he will_be eligible_for an annual pension of more_than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits . during mr._mcgovern 's nine-year term as president , the company 's sales_rose to $ 5.7 billion from $_2.8 billion and net_income increased to $ 274 million from $_130 million , the statement said_0 . mr._baum said_0 he and mr. harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 . `` you_'ve got to make the restructuring work , '' said mr._baum . `` you_'ve got to make those savings now . '' mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr._baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company . ``_we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact_that we have a tremendous management_team , '' he said . he predicted that the board would_give the current duo until early_next year before naming a new chief_executive . mr._baum said_0 the two have orders to `` focus_on bottom-line profits '' and to `` take a hard look_at our businesses -- what is good , what is not so good . '' analysts generally applaud the performance of campbell u.s.a. , the company 's_largest division , which posted 6_% unit sales_growth and a 15_% improvement in operating_profit for fiscal_1989 . `` the way that we_'ve been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other_areas of the company , '' mr._baum said . in the interview at headquarters yesterday_afternoon , both_men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together . `` you_'ve got two champions sitting right before you , '' said mr._baum . ``_we play to win .
