silicon_valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday . though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along_with the rest of the san_francisco bay_area , a spot check of computer_makers turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment . analysts and corporate officials said_0 they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the valley of either hardware or software goods . intel_corp. , advanced micro devices inc. and national_semiconductor corp. were all up and running yesterday , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take the day off . `` these systems are more rugged than many_people would believe , '' said thomas kurlak , who tracks the computer_industry for merrill_lynch research . `` it 's not the end of the world if_you shake them up a little_bit . '' other companies , including international_business machines_corp. and hewlett-packard_co. , completely idled their operations because of tuesday evening 's temblor , which registered 6.9 on the richter_scale . personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses , mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors . still , many were confident_that `` in a day or two , everything should_be back to normal , '' according_to a spokeswoman for the semiconductor industry_association , based in cupertino . ibm , for_instance , said_0 it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its san_jose plant , which puts out disk_drives for the 3090 family of mainframes . a hewlett-packard spokeswoman_said that , while `` things are a big mess , '' some 18,000 valley employees have_been called back to work today . apple_computer added that it was being `` cautiously optimistic , '' despite not_yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region . even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant fremont plant , to the north of the valley , was believed to be undamaged . sun_microsystems inc. and tandem_computers inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly . digital_equipment corp. , with major facilities in santa_clara , cupertino , palo_alto and mountain view , said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in maynard , mass. , tuesday_night . none sustained `` significant '' damage , a spokesman_said 0 , adding_that `` the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally . '' for many companies , of course , there_is still a slew of nagging problems 0 to grapple with , some of which have the potential to become quite serious . for_example , a spokesman for advanced micro devices said_0 the sunnyvale chip maker is worried_about blackouts . a sudden surge or drop in electric_power could ruin integrated_circuits being built . but , given what might_have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business , the bulk of valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas . several factors apparently spared the valley -- a sprawling suburban stretch from san_jose to palo_alto -- from the kind_of impact felt in san_francisco , an_hour 's drive north . for one_thing , buildings there tend_to be newer and , thus , in step with the latest safety codes . also , the soil in the valley is solid , unlike the landfill of san_francisco 's downtown marina_district , which was hit with fires and vast destruction . in_addition , some microelectronics companies said_0 they_were prepared for tremulous conditions like tuesday 's . their machine_tools are even bolted to the shop floor . intel said that over the past_decade , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its plants . like other large valley companies , intel also_noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation , so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch . that 's certainly good_news for such companies as compaq_computer corp. , houston , which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory . compaq said_0 it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future . computer_makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster . digital_equipment has set_up disaster-recovery response centers in dallas , atlanta and colorado_springs , colo . these units were handling calls both from people in the san_francisco area and from computers themselves , which are set to dial digital automatically when trouble arises . they then run remotely controlled self-diagnostic programs . digital also said_0 it has dispatched teams of technicians to california . meanwhile , several other major installations around the valley -- america 's center of high-tech -- said_0 they , too , fared as_well as could_be expected . lawrence livermore national_laboratory , where the energy department tests and conducts research on nuclear_weapons , had only `` superficial damage , '' a spokesman_said 0 . at lockheed_corp. 's missiles and space systems group in sunnyvale , about 40 miles south of san_francisco , workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that `` there_were no show-stoppers '' in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus . several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make_sure 0 they_were n't in danger of crumbling , but `` the bulk of the place is in pretty_good shape , '' an_official said_0 . one of lockheed 's most_lucrative sectors -- accounting for more_than half the aerospace company 's $ 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime pentagon contractor on the trident ii ballistic missile . it also generates pieces of the missile shield called the strategic_defense initiative . fortunately , the hubble space telescope -- set to be launched on the shuttle next_year in a search_for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years_ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from sunnyvale to the kennedy space center in florida at the beginning of october . john_r. wilke contribued to this_article .
