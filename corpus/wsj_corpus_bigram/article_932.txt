economist david n. laband 's sept. 27 editorial-page_article , `` in hugo 's path , a man-made disaster , '' decries the control of price gouging , swiftly ordered by south_carolina 's governor after hurricane_hugo . according_to mr._laband , `` screaming '' for price controls occurs when income redistribution `` threatens to hit home . '' to be_sure , the threat has hit home down here . yet in mr._laband 's rehash of free-market logic , human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions . allowing uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at stores , as he_contends 0 . but not because resources are going_to their most efficient use , leaving scarce goods `` allocated to those buyers who place the highest value on them . '' rather , lines would diminish because at higher_prices many victims could not afford necessities such_as food and medical supplies . it is inhumane to imply that a poor , unemployed woman can_not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does_not have as_much 0 to_protect as a rich family . moreover , essential relief supplies such_as ice must_be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease . such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources . fortunately , volunteers and charities are not motivated by self-interest , but by altruism . why_should they have to co-exist with opportunists rushing in to turn a quick profit ? these latter-day scalawags would_be ill-advised to take_advantage of the situation , if_they ever expect to face the people of south_carolina again . the government is actually protecting avaricious ice-baggers and other profiteers who can_not see beyond their_own short-term gain . south_carolina deserves an a for its quick and timely relief efforts . mr._laband , meanwhile , gets an a for his rote recital of economic-efficiency arguments . give him an f for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity . signed by 25 students of douglas woodward 's honors economics class , university of south_carolina columbia , s.c . mr._laband gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong . they set_up absurd situations , detached from reality , and then try_to reason from them . i_'m surprised 0 he did_n't advocate letting people loot , since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and `` every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor . '' price controls were `` so fervently embraced by charleston '' because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting . suzanne foster galax , va . mr._laband described one of the more insidious threats 0 we face when dealing_with disasters such_as hugo -- anti-profiteering ordinances such_as that by the charleston city_council as it thrashed about trying_to do_something . since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances , he did_n't mention certain other of their effects . they divert law-enforcement resources at a time 0 they_are most needed for protecting lives and property . also , rather_than increase supplies , they reduce them and encourage hoarding . and they , or even the prospect of them , discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants . n. joseph potts miami lakes , fla . would mr._laband also suggest_that the red_cross , salvation army , military units , police , fire departments , rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to_assist hugo 's victims because_they interfere_with his concept of the `` free market '' ? what about those caring people all over the country who are donating food , water and other necessities of life to these people_who could_be any of us ? should they , too , stop `` messing with '' his free market ? maybe he_thinks 0 they should also sell to the highest bidder . and what about insurance firms ? should they be_required to pay claims based_on exorbitant costs for labor and materials ? mr._laband should beware , since he lives in south_carolina . in a free market , his insurance rates can_be raised to recover insurance-company losses . john w. rush marietta , ga . having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes , i have a different perspective . mine comes from seeing thriving communities devastated -- but only temporarily . their recovery came surprisingly fast , and always with the help of neighbors . the shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such_as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat . in texas after hurricane alicia , major grocery chains used their truck fleets to ship essential goods to houston , no gouging , just good will . tom mongan victoria , texas we here in the affected areas were dazzled by mr._laband 's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development . his theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no_doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him . too bad theory fails in practice . we consumers tend_to have long memories . the businesses subscribing to mr._laband 's effective price system will_be remembered when normalcy returns . perhaps , considering the value of our time , we will_be unable_to patronize their establishments in the post-hugo era . i have a question for mr._laband : how do i explain to the single mother of three standing in line next to me for the past_three hours that the two bags of ice 0 she needs to_keep her children 's food edible will_take her last $ 20 ? i_'m sure_0 she 'll appreciate what an efficient reaction to her problems the price system has created . chris edgar myrtle beach , s.c .
