just after midnight monday , federal spending started to drop by $ 16 billion . what do you say we all close down the poker game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ? that 's essentially what budget_director richard_darman is suggesting , and we_think 0 he deserves as_much support as he can_get . if human beings ca_n't cut federal spending honestly -- and they ca_n't -- let the computers do it . congress , with a measure of white_house complicity , has_been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations_bills . -lrb- indeed without earlier manipulations , the current sequester of $ 16 billion would_have been even larger . -rrb- we suspect 0 voters are fed up with the finagling . consider , for_instance , that even yesterday 's widely publicized sequester is_likely to be traduced if business as_usual is allowed to prevail . under the law , gramm-rudman 's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed_to be permanent . social_security and spending for poor people are exempted . however , the associated press 's account of the monday sequester order signed by president_bush neatly captured the contempt 0 congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment : `` lawmakers have_been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as_soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill . '' mr. darman 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by white_house press_secretary marlin_fitzwater : `` there_is some feeling here that the cuts are the way_0 to go . it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion . '' this attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around washington as little more_than tough talk . it looks to us like a golden opportunity for george_bush to chop off at the knees all this talk_about a timid , unserious presidency . mr._bush would_be acting in the public_interest if he let the washington elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats , the lobbyists , the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet . ask tommy lasorda ; thin is in . senator phil gramm pointed_out monday that in the 20_years before gramm-rudman was enacted in 1985 , federal spending grew by about 11_% a year ; since the law , it 's grown at under 5_% annually . another major factor in this positive trend was ronald_reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather_than raising taxes . george_bush 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring congress to make choices among competing priorities , rather_than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the pac trough . if washington 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam , americans will_be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs , such_as federalized child_care . child_care was one of the many `` extraneous '' bills pulled_out of the senate 's reconciliation_bill last_friday . others were the capital-gains_cut , section_89 repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act . all this stuff still is in the house 's 1,878-page reconciliation_bill , and many members say_0 they_'re reluctant_to pull out cherished bills , just to see them die . republicans especially want a guarantee from the house leadership that they_'ll get an up-or-down vote_on the bills . house_speaker foley ought_to deliver that promise . this is the way_0 government is supposed_to work , with politicians taking responsibility_for votes that their constituents can identify , instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck . we have as_much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy , breezy days in washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a_bit to see that the bridges got build , roads paved , soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for . those days are gone . nor do we see any reason 0 to believe_that a metropolitan washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its_own initiative . save the sequester , and let washington scream .
