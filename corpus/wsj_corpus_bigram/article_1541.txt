earlier_this year , president_bush made a final `` take-it-or-leave it '' offer on the minimum_wage : an_increase to $_4.25 an_hour over three_years , and only if accompanied_by a lower wage for the first_six months of a job . now , the white_house has decided to accept the higher wage over only two_years . the sub-minimum wage would_apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90_days . the white_house had enough_votes to sustain a veto but chose to_avoid a confrontation . the only permanent losers will_be the 200,000 or so workers 0 everyone agrees 0 will_be priced out of a job at the $_4.25 rate 0 congress is_likely to approve today . it is compromises such_as this that convince washington 's liberals that if_they simply stay the course , this administration will stray from its_own course on this and other issues .
