britain_'s blue_arrow plc intends_to change its name to manpower plc and write_off a chunk of the nearly $_1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of u.s.-based manpower inc . blue_arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an_interview that the two steps may_be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's_biggest employment-services group in the u.s. . mr._fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few_months , as blue_arrow posted a 2.5_% drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings . the name change and good will write-off could help solidify blue_arrow 's dominance of the u.s. temporary-help market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday_'s market_plunge . u.s. holders now own more_than 60_% of blue_arrow compared_with 9_% last january . `` in the u.s. market , the recognition of the manpower name is infinitely stronger than blue_arrow , '' mr._fromstein said . the moves also could erase shareholders_' perception of blue_arrow as a company in turmoil . `` it further reinforces the concept that blue_arrow is a thing of the past , '' said doug arthur , an_analyst at kidder_peabody &_co. in new_york . the proposed_changes `` all make a_lot of sense to me , '' he_added 0 . in a widely publicized boardroom coup , mr._fromstein ousted antony berry as blue_arrow chief_executive in january , a month after mr. berry had forced mr._fromstein out as the $_1 million-a-year chief of milwaukee-based manpower . mr._fromstein solidified his control in april by taking_over from mr. berry as chairman . but the blue_arrow tumult is n't over yet , as the british_government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -lrb- $ 39.4 million -rrb- loan which mr._fromstein has said_0 was made under mr. berry 's direction . blue_arrow was able_to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of manpower in 1987 largely_because different british and american accounting_standards produce higher reported_earnings for british companies . under british rules , blue_arrow was able_to write_off at once the $_1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . as a u.s.-based company , blue_arrow would_have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag_on reported_earnings . good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market_value of those assets . but with so_many shares now held in the u.s. , blue_arrow reports its earnings two ways , based_on both u.k. and u.s. accounting_standards . `` our balance_sheets look_like they came from alice 's wonderland , '' mr._fromstein said . the british version shows `` a_handful of pounds of net_worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the american version reflects `` $_1 billion of net_worth because almost none of -lcb- the good will -rcb- has_been written off . '' mr._fromstein said_0 he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on blue_arrow 's u.s. books in one fell swoop , but would n't_specify how_much . people close to blue_arrow suggested 0 the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming 0 prior management overstated the extent of manpower 's good will . that move , along_with the return to the manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . the number_of u.s. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12_months ending aug._31 , after sliding nearly 3.5_% in july , said_0 kidder_peabody 's mr. arthur . blue_arrow blamed the pretax_profit drop in the quarter_ended july_31 partly on slower earnings_growth of non-manpower units in britain . overall , pretax_profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year_earlier .
