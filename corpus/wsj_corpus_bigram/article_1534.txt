du_pont co. , hewlett-packard_co. and los alamos national_laboratory said_0 they signed a three-year , $ 11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research . the collaboration will include at_least 25 researchers and will_be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics , the companies said_0 . the materials , discovered during the past_three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies . joint-research programs have proliferated as u.s. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia , especially in japan . the latest research pact bolsters du_pont 's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors . the wilmington , del. , chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements_with oak ridge national_laboratory and with argonne national_laboratory . last_year , du_pont agreed_to pay $_4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the university of houston . hewlett-packard is a palo_alto , calif. , computer_maker . the los alamos laboratory is one of three u.s. department of energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs 0 to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace .
