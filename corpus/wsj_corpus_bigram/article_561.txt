when it comes to buying and selling shares , westridge_capital management_inc. takes a back seat to no_one . every dollar 's worth of stock in the los_angeles money_manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates 0 . that makes it the most_active trader among all the nation_'s investment_advisers , according_to securities and exchange_commission filings . but wait a second . westridge_capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more_than average . westridge_capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing . indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock_market barometer , such_as standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index , and match its performance . institutional_investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment_management that promises to post average market returns . these big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock_pickers have_been able_to consistently match the returns of the s&p_500 or other bellwethers , much_less beat it . and the fees 0 investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $_100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers . that 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading_activity keeps a lid on commission costs . but today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one . because index-fund managers are no_longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended_to outperform the market as_much as three percentage_points . `` indexing has_been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has_been just sort of sitting there , ''_says seth m. lynn , president of axe core investors inc. , an indexer based in tarrytown , n.y . `` now the interest is in what else can i_do with that money . '' among the souped-up indexing strategies : indexed portfolios can_be built around thousands_of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather_than being restricted to the s&p_500 companies . they_can ignore the s&p_500 stocks altogether and focus_on particular types_of stocks , such_as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . with today 's computer-driven_program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index_futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such_as the s&p_500 . futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do_n't actually own a single share of stock , but can_produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock_market . one_reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid_growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the s&p_500 . `` there_is n't a boatload -lcb- of big investors -rcb- out there still waiting to get into indexing , ''_says p. james kartalia , vice_president of anb investment_management co. , chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services . -lrb- after tripling in size in the past_five years , index funds now hold about 20_% of the stock owned_by pension_funds . -rrb- a further problem is razor-thin profits . plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees 0 they_can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some_cases are just that . to land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free . `` it 's like getting a free toaster when_you open an account , ''_says axe core 's mr. lynn . as a result , indexers have_been looking_for ways_0 to give investors something more_than the average for their money . and many have_been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader westridge_capital . westridge_capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the s&p_500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage_points over the past_four years , with the same risk level as holding the s&p_500 stocks , according_to james carder , the firm 's president . strategies vary for westridge_capital , which has $_300 million under management . the firm sometimes buys s&p_500 futures when they_are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index_futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies . mr. carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines . and in some months , he buys stock-index_futures and not stocks at all . `` by their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going_to create high turnover , '' mr. carder adds . `` the more turnover , the better for our clients . '' big indexer bankers_trust co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage_point to its enhanced fund 's returns . j. thomas allen , president of pittsburgh-based advanced investment_management inc. , agrees 0 it 's a good_idea to jump between the s&p_500 stocks and futures . `` you_'re buying the s&p , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he_says . but some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors . `` if the futures_markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , ''_says john zumbrunn , managing_director of prudential_insurance co. of america 's investment index technologies inc. unit . prudential currently is_seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p_500 index plus 5\/100 of a percentage_point . an added feature is that the slighty improved return would_be guaranteed_by prudential . there_are many other strategies 0 to bolster the returns of index funds . they include : limited risk funds : these guarantee protection against stock_market declines while still passing along most gains . here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $_100 invested for a year , even_if the market goes much lower . the fund could invest $ 87 for one year in treasury_bills yielding 8_% to return the guaranteed $ 95 . that leaves $ 13 , which could_be used to buy s&p_500 options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index . manager replication funds : say_0 a big investor is interested_in growth_stocks . instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing_in growth_stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will_be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -lrb- because of the large_number of stocks -rrb- . ``_we see a_lot of interest in those kind_of things , ''_says frank salerno , a vice_president of bankers_trust . `` people comfortable_with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . '' tilt funds : this is an index fund with a bet . instead of replicating the s&p_500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio . one simple approach is to exclude s&p_500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like chrysler_corp. rebounds . another approach : an_investor with $_100 million might use $_75 million to buy the s&p_500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks . specialized funds : indexes can_be constructed 0 to serve social goals , such_as eliminating the stocks of companies doing_business in south_africa . other funds have_been designed to concentrate_on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment . pennsylvania state employees retirement system , for_example , has about $_130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either pennsylvania-based or have 25_% of their work forces in the state .
