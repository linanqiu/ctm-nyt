in a surprise move , the british_government cleared the way for a bidding_war for jaguar_plc by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto_maker . trade and industry secretary_nicholas ridley told the house of commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government 's so-called golden_share in the company as long as jaguar_shareholders agree . the golden_share restricts any individual holding to 15_% and expires at the end of 1990 . it was in jaguar 's best interests `` for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , '' mr. ridley said_0 . mr. ridley 's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto_giants for britain_'s leading luxury-car maker . both general_motors corp. and ford_motor co. have_been trying_to amass 15_% stakes in jaguar . ford , which already_has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding , is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early . gm has_been negotiating a friendly transaction with jaguar that likely would involve joint_ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30_% . but the government 's action , which caught jaguar management flat-footed , may scuttle the gm minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of jaguar . ``_i ca_n't believe_0 they -lrb- gm -rrb- will let ford have a free run , '' said stephen reitman , a european auto_industry analyst_at ubs-phillips &_drew . ``_i am sure_0 they will_be going for a full bid . '' many investors certainly believe_0 a bidding_war is imminent . jaguar_shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on london 's stock_exchange . in late trading , the shares were up a whopping 122 pence_-lrb- $ 1.93 -rrb- -- a 16.3 % gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy_volume of 9.7_million shares . in the u.s. over-the-counter_market , jaguar_shares trading as american_depositary receipts closed_at $ 13.625 , up $_1.75 . analysts_expect 0 ford will make the first move , perhaps today , with an_initial offer of about 900 pence_-lrb- $ 14.25 -rrb- a_share . such a proposal values jaguar at more_than # 1.6_billion -lrb- $ 2.53 billion -rrb- . speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar_shares soaring in the past six weeks . the share price was languishing at about 400 pence before ford 's sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority_stake . ford is `` in the driving seat at the moment , '' observed 0 bob barber , an auto analyst_at brokers james_capel &_co . an aggressive ford bid for jaguar would put pressure_on gm to make a better offer as the british company 's `` white_knight . '' such a countermove could end jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and british-owned . but it is n't clear how_long gm would_be willing_to fight ford for jaguar . because of their longstanding rivalry , gm just `` wants to make_sure 0 ford pays a huge packet for -lrb- jaguar -rrb- , '' said_0 john lawson , an auto analyst_at london 's nomura research_institute . people close to the gm-jaguar talks agreed that ford now may_be able_to shut out general_motors . `` it 's either going_to be a shootout , or there only may_be one player in town , '' one_person said . another person close to the talks said , 0 `` it is very_hard to justify paying a silly price for jaguar if an out-and-out bidding_war were to start now . '' in a statement , jaguar 's board said_0 they `` were not consulted about the -lrb- ridley decision -rrb- in advance and were surprised at the action taken . '' the statement emphasized that holders representing 75_% of the shares voting at a special shareholders_' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions . jaguar officials in the u.s. noted_that ford , as jaguar 's_largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . u.s._auto analysts also_noted that ford is in the best position 0 to benefit from the large_number of jaguar_shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting_for the highest takeover_bid . jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile_bid are weakened , analysts add 0 , because fewer_than 3_% of its shares are owned_by employees and management . ford officials in the u.s. declined to comment_on the british_government 's action or on any plans to call a special jaguar_shareholders meeting . but gm officials said_0 they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . '' although gm has u.s. approval to buy up to 15_% of jaguar 's stock , it has n't_yet disclosed how_many shares it now owns . in a prepared statement , gm suggested 0 its plans for jaguar would_be more valuable in the long_run than the initial windfalls 0 investors might reap from a hostile ford bid . `` our intensive discussions_with jaguar , at their invitation , '' gm said , `` have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship_with jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great british car company , to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders . '' jaguar was shocked by mr. ridley 's decision , because management had believed 0 the government would n't lift the golden_share without consulting the company first . indeed , the government is taking a calculated risk . mr. ridley 's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition labor_party , who accused the thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company . the british_government retained the single golden_share after selling its stake_in jaguar in the conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expected in late_1991 . `` it 's now a very_good time politically 0 to get this over and done with , '' observed daniel jones , professor of motor industry management at the university of cardiff in wales . the government , already buffeted by high_interest rates and a slowing_economy , has_been badly hurt_by last_week 's shake-up in mrs._thatcher 's cabinet . at the same_time , the government did_n't want to appear to favor gm by allowing a minority_stake that might preclude a full bid by ford . mr. ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of parliament after his announcement . he said_0 he was giving_up the golden_share `` to clear the way so the playing_field is level between all contestants .
