the united_kingdom high_court declared illegal a variety_of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial_banks . the ruling could_lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts 0 the london borough of hammersmith and fulham ran up after losing heavily_on swap transactions . as many as 70 u.k. and international banks stand to lose several_hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities . an_appeal is_expected . in response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more_than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session . gilts , or british_government bonds , which also fell_sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 point_lower . the council , which is alleged to have engaged_in over 600 deals valued_at over # 6_billion -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals . at one_point , hammersmith is reported to have accounted_for as_much as 10_% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings . when two parties engage_in an interest-rate swap , they_are betting against each_other on future rates . thus , an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest_payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments . in most of the british transactions , the municipalities agreed_to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments . as interest_rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more_than the banks were paying them . the court hearing began in early_october at the request of anthony hazell , district auditor for hammersmith , who argued_that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage_in such capital-markets activities . the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal . although the hammersmith and fulham council was by far the most_active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court_decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils . `` while this court_ruling was only on hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said . already , 10 local councils have refused_to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings . other financial_institutions involved include barclays bank_plc , midland bank_plc , security_pacific corp. , chemical_banking corp. 's chemical_bank , citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international . if the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources_said 0 . banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils . officials from the various banks involved are_expected to meet during the next_few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could_be questionable . the banks have 28 days 0 to file an_appeal against the ruling and are_expected to do_so shortly .
