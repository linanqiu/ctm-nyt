common cause asked both the senate ethics_committee and the justice_department to investigate $_1 million in political gifts by arizona businessman charles keating to five u.s. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him . mr._keating is currently the subject of a $_1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a california thrift 0 he controlled , lincoln_savings &_loan association , and driving it into insolvency . fred wertheimer -- president of common cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said_0 mr._keating already_has conceded attempting_to buy influence with the lawmakers -- democratic sens. dennis deconcini of arizona , alan_cranston of california , john glenn of ohio and donald riegle of michigan ; and gop sen. john mccain of arizona . mr. wertheimer based this on a statement by mr._keating that was_quoted in a wall_street journal story in april : `` one question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . i want to say in the most forceful way_0 i can : 0 i certainly hope so . '' in a highly unusual meeting in sen. deconcini 's office in april_1987 , the five senators asked federal_regulators to ease up on lincoln . according_to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said_0 lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . '' mr._keating had complained_that the regulators were being too zealous . the notes show that sen. deconcini called the federal_home loan bank board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that sen. glenn insisted_that mr._keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' for the next two_years , the bank board , which at the time was the agency responsible_for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in may 1987 that mr._keating had caused lincoln to become insolvent . lincoln 's parent_company , american_continental corp. , entered bankruptcy-law_proceedings this april 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . the newly_formed resolution_trust corp. , successor to the bank board , filed_suit against mr._keating and several others on sept. 15 . mr._keating has filed his_own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally . the cost to taxpayers of lincoln 's collapse has_been estimated at as_much as $_2.5 billion . details of the affair have become public gradually over the past_two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . in the midst_of his 1988 re-election campaign , sen. riegle , chairman of the senate_banking committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a detroit newspaper said that mr._keating had gathered the money for him about two_weeks before the meeting with regulators . sen. deconcini , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last_month , shortly_after the government formally accused mr._keating of defrauding lincoln . in_addition , sen._mccain last_week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to american_continental as reimbursement for trips 0 he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to mr._keating 's vacation home at cat cay , the bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 . sen._mccain said_0 he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . '' mr._keating , his family_members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to sen._mccain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according_to press accounts . but sen._mccain says_0 mr._keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused_to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as mr._keating wanted . `` he became very angry at that , left my office and told a number_of people that i was a wimp , '' sen._mccain recalls . in july , california newspapers disclosed that mr._keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of sen._cranston , who conceded_that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing 0 to do politically . '' in_addition , sen._cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through mr._keating , and the california democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . also in july , ohio newspapers disclosed $_200,000 in corporate donations by mr._keating to the national council on public policy , a political committee controlled_by sen. glenn . that was in_addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by mr._keating to the ohio senator . mr. wertheimer said_0 the senate ethics_committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an_investigation , as was done in the case of former house_speaker james wright . wilson abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't_comment . sen. riegle said_0 he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had_been `` entirely proper . '' sen._mccain said_0 he had_been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided 0 it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent . sen. glenn said_0 he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and ``_i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the senate ethics_committee . '' sen. deconcini said , `` when all is said and done , i expect to be fully exonerated . '' sen._cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the federal_bureau of investigation in any investigation of mr._keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act . `` why did_n't the bank board act sooner ? '' he said . `` that is what common cause should ask 0 be investigated .
