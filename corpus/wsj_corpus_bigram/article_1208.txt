share prices_plummeted across_europe yesterday in response to friday_'s new_york sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after wall_street opened without another rout . european investors have further reason for optimism today , after the u.s. rebound . the frankfurt stock_exchange , which closed before the new_york exchanges opened , was the hardest_hit of the major european markets , with the dax_index dropping 12.8_% . in london , prices_plummeted in early_trading and were off as_much as 9_% before coming_back strong after the new_york opening to close down only 3.2_% . west_german economics minister helmut haussmann said , `` in my view , the stock_market will stabilize relatively quickly . there may_be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they_are n't based_on fundamentals . the economy of west_germany and the ec -lcb- european_community -rcb- is highly stable . '' paris , which has_been the center of speculation fever in recent_weeks , also was hard hit . share prices_fell in milan , amsterdam , zurich , madrid and stockholm . prices in brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled . following is a breakdown of major market_activity : frankfurt : one of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of europe 's strongest economy . the dax_index of 30 west_german blue_chips plunged 12.8_% , a one-day record , wiping out the summer 's gains . the index_closed at 1385.72 , down 203.56 points . by_comparison , two_years ago on black_monday , the new index would_have dropped 9.4 % , according_to a projection by the exchange . investors may_have reacted so strongly to friday_'s u.s. stock_market loss because_they had vivid memories of the frankfurt exchange 's losing 35_% of its value in the 1987_crash and its wake . this time , however , many_small investors may_have been hurt_by acting so swiftly . `` they all went in the wrong direction , '' said andreas insam , an investment_adviser for the bank in liechtenstein 's frankfurt branch . he said_0 he told clients to buy selected west_german blue_chips after they fell by about 10_% . after the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell_orders , frankfurt 's normal two-hour trading_session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy_volume . `` the beginning was chaotic , '' said nigel longley , a broker for commerzbank ag . `` it took three-quarters of an_hour before enough prices could_be worked_out to get a reading on the market . '' institutional_investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8_% decline in tokyo_stock prices . `` everybody was still confident , including most institutional_investors . that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell_orders from small private investors , '' said norbert braeuer , a senior trader for hessische landesbank . some big institutions , including banks , began picking_up lower-priced shares late_yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in new_york before acting . but even_if wall_street continues to stabilize , analysts here say_0 the latest blow to investor_confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the frankfurt exchange , which already was showing_signs of weakness after the dax had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on sept. 8 . some of west_germany 's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits . a 16.3 % drop for mannesmann ag and dresdner_bank ag 's 9.6_% decline were especially problematic for their_respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in november could now be in jeopardy . dresdner_bank last_month said_0 it hoped to raise 1.2_billion marks_-lrb- $ 642.2 million -rrb- by issuing four million_shares at 300 marks each . yet yesterday 's market cropped dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a_share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly . london : headed toward a record drop at midday , the london stock_market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake_of new_york 's early rally . the financial_times-stock exchange 100 share index_closed off 70.5 points , at 2163.4 , its high for the day , after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m . it was big institutions such_as norwich union insurance group , scottish amicable investment managers and standard life assurance co. that spearheaded the rally . attracted by low prices and encouraged_by new_york 's performance , they scooped up equities across the board . volume_was 959.3 million_shares , more_than triple recent levels . paris : late buying gave the paris bourse a parachute after its free_fall early in the day . the cac general index ended down 5.4 % at 523.6 , a drop of 29.6 points from friday . `` there was a volatility in the market that i have never_seen before , '' said michel vigier , a partner in brokerage_firm cholet dupont . `` when wall_street turned around shortly_after the opening , there was panic buying in paris . '' brokers said that as the news spread that wall_street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell_orders changed their line in mid-conversation , ordering buys instead . trading was driven primarily by small_investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day . when wall_street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking_for bargains .
