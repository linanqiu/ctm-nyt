reaching for that extra bit of yield can_be a big mistake -- especially if_you do_n't understand what you_'re investing in . just ask richard blumenfeld , a new_jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . '' in may 1986 , dr._blumenfeld gave merrill_lynch &_co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more_than 9_% . `` it was a time when interest_rates came down very rapidly , '' dr._blumenfeld recalls . yields_on five-year cds at major_banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year treasury notes were paying less_than 8_% . the cd seemed like a great_deal . but nearly 3_1\/2 years_later , merrill says_0 the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2_% on dr._blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . the problem is that the cd 0 he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla cd . instead , his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd , which is sold at a deep discount to its face_value . the difference_between the price and the face_value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . more_important , the cd was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market . because the cd had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest_rates in general had declined sharply since_then , part_of the price 0 dr._blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an_additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued_interest that represented the cd 's increased market_value . now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent , and dr._blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal_deposit insurance . the tip-off came when he opened a recent merrill_lynch statement and found that the cd 's `` estimated current market_value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . several phone_calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium 0 he paid when he bought the cd , and that the amount was n't insured . `` this is one_thing 0 i was never aware of , '' he_says . he assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $_100,000 , '' he_adds . dr._blumenfeld is n't unique . especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields 0 they have come to expect , too_many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk . `` yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , ''_says john markese , research_director of the american association of individual_investors , a chicago-based educational group . `` the biggest problem 0 we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they_did n't understand what they_were investing in . '' dr._blumenfeld concedes 0 he did_n't fully understand what he was buying . he_says that he knew 0 he was getting a zero-coupon cd and that he had previously invested in tigrs -lrb- treasury income growth receipts -rrb- , a type of zero-coupon treasury security sold by merrill_lynch . but he_says 0 he did_n't understand 0 he was buying the cd on the secondary_market , and he_contends 0 his broker never fully explained the risks . the broker , thomas beairsto of merrill_lynch 's morristown , n.j. , office , refuses to_discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to merrill_lynch officials in new_york . those officials_say 0 there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale . the fact sheet , dated april_1986 , says on page three : `` if the price paid for a cd purchased in the secondary_market ... is higher_than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon_cds , the difference ... is not insured ... . computations involving zero-coupon_cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions 0 you may_have with your financial consultant . '' dr._blumenfeld says_0 he does_n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet 0 he received and did_n't realize 0 part_of what he paid was a premium . ``_i assumed 0 i was buying a cd as a cd , '' he_says . nevertheless , merrill_lynch has_agreed that if the thrift that issued dr._blumenfeld 's cd , peoples heritage federal_savings &_loan association in salina , kan. , is liquidated and the cd terminated , the brokerage_firm would cover the premium 0 dr._blumenfeld paid . -lrb- federal_deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $_100,000 . -rrb- `` it 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , ''_says albert disposti , a managing_director of merrill_lynch money markets inc . `` there 's a question_whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . ``_we were n't sure that full disclosure , as we_wanted it , was being made . '' merrill_lynch says_0 it 's impossible to estimate how_many investors are in dr._blumenfeld 's situation , although it says_0 the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary_market in three_years . merrill_lynch now provides credit rating information_about the institutions whose cds it sells , which it did_n't provide in 1986 . zero-coupon_cds are only a small portion_of the $_1 trillion-plus in cds outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary_market are an even smaller part_of the total . merrill_lynch estimates that fewer_than 10 financial_institutions currently issue zero-coupon_cds . still , there_are several billion dollars of zero-coupon_cds with various maturities outstanding . because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income_tax is payable in the year 0 interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon_cds are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education . most zero-coupon_cds are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . but investors who bought zero-coupon_cds in the secondary_market are n't the only ones who may_be surprised to learn 0 the full amount of their investments is n't insured . people_who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary_market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed . however , those premiums are usually far smaller_than on zero-coupon_cds , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . whatever the case , a merrill_lynch spokesman emphasizes 0 , investors should n't have to worry_about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the cd is closed and its deposits paid_off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate . dr._blumenfeld says_0 he 's satisfied that his problem has_been resolved . and he_says 0 he 's learned a lesson : `` you always have to watch out for yourself . no_one else will watch out for you .
