when the price of plastics took off in 1987 , quantum chemical corp. went along for the ride . the timing of quantum 's chief_executive officer , john hoyt stookey , appeared to be nothing less_than inspired , because he had just increased quantum 's reliance_on plastics . the company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two_years . mr. stookey said of the boom , 0 `` it 's going_to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks_0 . '' but now prices have nose-dived and quantum 's profit is plummeting . some securities analysts are_looking for no better_than break-even results from the company for the third_quarter , compared_with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a_share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . the stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. 1 , closed_at $ 34.375 share , down $_1.125 , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading friday . to a degree , quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life . having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding . pricing cycles , to be_sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them . ``_we were all wonderful heroes last_year , ''_says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors . `` now we_'re at the bottom of the heap . '' at quantum , which is based in new_york , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics . once known_as national distillers & chemical corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after mr. stookey took the chief_executive 's job in 1986 . mr. stookey , 59 years_old , declined to be_interviewed for this_article , but he has consistently argued_that over the long_haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- quantum will prosper through its new direction . quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among_other items . in the u.s. polyethylene market , quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20_% . but its competitors --_including dow_chemical co. , union_carbide corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price_swings . when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents_a share , provided 0 no other variables are changing . in recent_months the price of polyethylene , even more_than that of other_commodity plastics , has_taken a dive . benchmark grades , which still sold for as_much as 50_cents a pound last_spring , have skidded to between 35_cents and 40_cents . meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . that discrepancy hurts quantum badly , because its_own plants cover only about_half of its ethylene needs . by many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this_year . china , which had_been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather_than order new product . kenneth mitchell , director of dow 's polyethylene business , says_0 producers were surprised to learn how_much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up . `` people were even hoarding bags , '' he_says . now producers hope 0 prices have hit_bottom . they recently_announced increases of a few cents_a pound 0 to take_effect in the next_several weeks . no_one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle . one doubter is george krug , a chemical-industry analyst_at oppenheimer_& co. and a bear on plastics stocks . noting others '_estimates of when price increases can_be sustained , he remarks , 0 `` some say october . some say november . i say 1992 . '' he argues_that efforts to firm up prices will_be undermined by producers ' plans to_expand production_capacity . a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . the company is trying_to carry_out a three-year , $_1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this_year . at the same_time , its annual payments on long-term_debt will more_than double from a year_ago to about $_240 million , largely_because of debt taken on to pay a $ 50-a-share special_dividend earlier_this year . quantum described the payout at the time as a way_0 for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . some_analysts saw the payment as an_effort also to dispel takeover_speculation . whether a cash_crunch might eventually force the company to cut its_quarterly dividend , raised 36_% to 75_cents a_share only a year_ago , has_become a topic of intense speculation on_wall street since mr. stookey deflected dividend questions in a sept._29 meeting with analysts . some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more_than the standard line from executives . but others came away thinking 0 he had given something less_than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance . in any_case , on the day of the meeting , quantum 's shares slid $_2.625 to $ 36.625 in big_board trading . on top of everything_else , quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in morris , ill . after an_explosion idled the plant in june , the company progressed in_september to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it . then a second explosion occurred . two workers died and six remain in the hospital . this human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes . until this_year , the company had_been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking_up trade-group safety awards . a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into quantum 's financial future . when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward . but the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting . `` you say_0 you could have sold x percent of this product and y percent of that , '' recalls theodore semegran , an_analyst at shearson_lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer . `` and then you still have to negotiate . '' quantum hopes 0 the morris plant , where limited production got under_way last_week , will resume full_operation by year 's end . the plant usually accounts for 20_% to 25_% of quantum 's polyethylene production and 50_% of its ethylene production . not everything looks grim for quantum . the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . by lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw_material costs . quantum is also tightening its grip_on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing . through a venture with its investment_banker , first_boston corp. , quantum completed in_august an acquisition of petrolane inc. in a transaction_valued at $_1.18 billion . petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s. . the largest , suburban propane , was already owned_by quantum . still , quantum has a crisis 0 to get past right_now . some_analysts speculate 0 the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . the name surfacing in rumors is british_petroleum co. , which is looking to_expand its polyethylene business in the u.s. . asked about a bid for quantum , a bp spokesman says , `` 0 we pretty_much have a policy of not commenting_on rumors , and i_think 0 that falls in that category .
