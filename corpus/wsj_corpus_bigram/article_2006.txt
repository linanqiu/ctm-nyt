at a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into west_germany 's financial center , the opening of a three-man office on a frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention . unless , of course , it happens to be run by the rothschilds . after an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the rothschild group to frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in town hall . like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set_up a financial_services outlet in europe 's_largest economy ahead of the integration of european_community markets after 1992 . yet the rothschilds do_n't deny an emotional element to the decision . in 1796 , mayer amschel rothschild founded bankhaus m.a. rothschild &_sons and later sent his four sons to london , paris , vienna and naples to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th_century . the original bank in frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of wilhelm carl von rothschild , and the family 's banking_activities focused_on london and paris . baron elie de rothschild , the family 's elder spokesman , explains that by the end of the 19th_century , berlin had replaced frankfurt as germany 's financial center . yet the chief reason for the closure , he_says 0 , was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the rothschild name without a rothschild in its management . `` at the time we had only daughters , '' explains the 72-year-old patriarch , `` so we had to close the bank . '' much of the family 's mystique remained . although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during world_war ii , the rothschilds ' place in frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the rothschild name . the family 's long absence is understandable . the family was in allied countries during both world_war i and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s . during the third reich , the rothschilds were a target of nazi propaganda against jewish financiers . the persecution pursued the rothschilds across_europe as the nazis grabbed countries , confiscating the family 's property in the process . american journalist william l. shirer , in his book `` the rise and fall of the third reich , '' wrote of how in vienna he had witnessed `` squads of -lcb- nazi -rcb- ss men carting off silver , tapestries , paintings and other loot from the rothschild palace . '' in the immediate postwar years , the rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations , delaying their return to frankfurt . `` for a member of the rothschild family , the return to frankfurt is a very meaningful event , although it might_not mean as_much to german banking as it means to us , ''_says baron david de rothschild , elie 's younger cousin and a partner in rothschild & cie . banque in paris . indeed , the competition is n't greatly concerned . `` it would_be surprising if_they did_n't come to frankfurt in time for 1992 , and they bring an interesting tradition . but the market really is n't going_to be stood on its head , '' said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks . the return of the rothschilds is modest . the new representative office , with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the rothschild family -- will carry_out no banking operations of its_own . instead , it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on_behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units : n m rothschild &_sons ltd. in london , rothschild & cie. in paris and rothschild bank ag in zurich . the constraints do_n't bother the office 's 54-year-old manager , erich stromeyer . he left his job as general_manager of shearson_lehman hutton holdings_inc. 's frankfurt office because , he_says 0 , `` when the rothschilds called , i could_n't resist . '' each rothschild bank is linked by family ties and cross-ownership . in march , n m rothschild in london and rothschild bank in zurich showed assets of # 4.1 billion -lrb- $ 6.51 billion -rrb- and 1.26 billion swiss_francs -lrb- $ 774 million -rrb- , respectively . the paris bank does_n't publish that figure . in europe , the rothschilds banks are focusing_on mergers and acquisitions as european industry restructures ahead of 1992 . yet the group 's limited resources makes it a niche player . ``_obviously , there_are quantitative limitations on the assistance 0 we_can provide , '' concedes baron david de rothschild , `` but we feel 0 we have some cards 0 to play . '' among them , he_says 0 , is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout europe and beyond . the rothschilds hope to use a long_history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional_investors . as at the zurich bank , the minimum investment for individuals will_be high : about a million german marks_-lrb- $ 538,000 -rrb- , three_times what many other west_german investment banks require . `` but we_do make exceptions , ''_says a smiling baron elie de rothschild , `` especially if_they are very young and have very rich parents .
