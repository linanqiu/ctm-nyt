in an_attempt to give new momentum to european_community plans for a single currency , ec government leaders are_likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the ec 's founding treaty of rome . according_to diplomatic sources in brussels , most ec leaders agree that talks should begin in the second_half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in strasbourg , france , on dec. 8 and 9 . the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime_minister margaret_thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single ec currency . but the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does_n't require unanimity . setting a date 0 to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could_be viewed_as an_important psychological push . french president francois mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last_june , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by mrs._thatcher and west_german chancellor helmut_kohl . diplomatic sources_said 0 mr. kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that west_germany is still committed to ec unity .
