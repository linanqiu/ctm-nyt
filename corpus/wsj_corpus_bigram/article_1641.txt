if there 's somethin' strange in your neighborhood ... if there 's something ' weird and it do_n't look good . who ya gon na call ? for starters , some people call ed and lorraine warren . when it comes to busting ghosts , the monroe , conn. , couple are perfect demons . they claim to have busted spirits , poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds_of houses around the country . they say_0 they now get three or four `` legitimate '' calls a week from people harried by haunts . ``_i firmly believe in angels , devils and ghosts , ''_says mr. warren , whose business card identifies him as a `` demonologist . '' if psychics do_n't work , but your house still seems haunted , you_can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such_as richard busch . a professional magician and musician , he heads the pittsburgh branch of the committee for the scientific investigation of the paranormal . mr. busch says_0 there_is a scientific explanation for all haunts , and he can even tell_you how to encourage the spirits . `` all 0 you have to do is eat a big pizza , and then go to bed , '' he_says . `` you_'ll have weird dreams , too . '' either_way , the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters . tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation_'s elm streets and amityvilles . ``_i get calls nearly every_day from people_who have ghosts in their house , ''_says raymond hyman , a skeptical psychology professor_at the university of oregon . in a public_opinion poll published in the october issue of parents magazine , a third of those queried said_0 they believe_that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people . `` the movies , the books , the tabloids -- even nancy reagan is boosting this stuff , ''_says paul kurtz , a philosophy professor_at the state_university of new_york at buffalo , who_heads the committee for the scientific investigation of the paranormal . the committee , formed in 1967 , now has 60 chapters around the world . the spirits , of course , could hardly care less whether people do or do_n't believe in them . they do_n't even give a nod to human sensibilities by celebrating halloween . for the spooks it 's just another day of ectoplasmic business as_usual , ghostbusters say_0 ; the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number_of ghost reports . one of the busiest ghostbusters is robert baker , a 68-year-old semi-retired university of kentucky psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost . mr._baker says_0 he has personally bested more_than 50 haunts , from aliens to poltergeists . mr._baker heads the kentucky association of science educators and skeptics . like hollywood 's ghostbusters , kentucky 's stand ready to roll when haunts get_out of hand . but they do_n't careen around in an old cadillac , wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits . mr._baker drives a 1987 chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays . ``_i 've_never met a ghost that could_n't be explained away by perfectly natural means , '' he_says . when a louisville woman complained_that a ghost was haunting her attic , mr._baker discovered a rat dragging a trap across the rafters . a foul-smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in mannington , ky . mr._baker found an opening under the house that led to a fume-filled coal mine . when the weather cools , mr._baker says_0 , hobos often hole up in abandoned houses . `` people see activity in there , and the next thing 0 you_know , you_'ve got a haunting , '' he_says . on a recent afternoon , mr._baker and a reporter go ghost-busting , visiting kathleen stinnett , a lexington woman_who has phoned the university of kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house . mrs. stinnett says_0 she never believed in ghosts before , but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on , a telephone flew off its stand , doors slammed inexplicably , and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen . ``_i was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who was there , and it was nobody , '' she_says , eyes wide at the recollection . mr._baker hears her out , pokes around a_bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations . of the self-starting vacuum cleaner , he_says : `` could_be cuddles , -lcb- mrs. stinnett 's dog -rcb- . '' the flying telephone : `` you tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . '' the ghostly footsteps : `` interstate 64 is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating . '' ``_i 'm_not sure_0 he 's explained everything , '' mrs. stinnett says grudgingly . `` there_are some things that have_gone on here that nobody can explain , '' she_says . mr._baker promises to return if the haunting continues . for especially stubborn haunts , mr._baker carries a secret weapon , a vial of cornstarch . ``_i tell people 0 it 's the groundup bones of saints , '' he_says . ``_i sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave . it 's reassuring , and it usually works . '' oregon 's mr. hyman has investigated claims of flying cats , apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come_up with a plausible explanation , he_says , for every one . `` invariably , '' he_says , `` eyewitnesses are untrustworthy . '' two_years ago , a canadian reader bet omni magazine $_1,000 that it could_n't debunk the uncanny goings-on in `` the oregon vortex , '' a former indian burial ground in southern oregon . to viewers from a distance , visitors to the spot seemed to shrink disproportionately , relative to the background . the magazine called in mr. hyman as a consultant . he showed up with a carpenter 's level , carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused_by the perspective . `` a very striking illusion , '' mr. hyman says now , his voice dripping with skepticism , `` but an illusion nevertheless . '' the canadian wound up writing a check . the rev. alphonsus trabold , a theology professor and exorcism expert at st. bonaventure university in olean , n.y. , frequently is asked to exorcise unruly spirits , and he often obliges . `` on certain occasions a spirit could_be earthbound and make itself known , '' he_says . `` it happens . '' father trabold often uses what he calls `` a therapeutic exorcism '' : a few prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave . `` if the person believes_0 there 's an evil spirit , you ask it to be gone , '' he_says . `` the suggestion itself may do the healing . '' but sometimes more energetic attacks are required . to wrestle with a demon in a house owned_by a litchfield , conn. , woman , the warrens recently called in an exorcist , the rev. robert mckenna , a dissident clergyman who hews to the catholic church 's old latin liturgy . i attend , and so does a television crew from new_york city . mr. warren pronounces the litchfield case `` your typical demonic infestation . '' a scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years_ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it , mr. warren says_0 . the owner , who begs anonymity , asserts that the dwarf , appearing as a dark shadow , has manhandled her , tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair . two previous exorcisms have failed . `` this is a very tenacious ghost , '' mr. warren says darkly . father mckenna moves through the house praying in latin , urging the demon to split . suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing . `` she 's being attacked by the demon , '' mrs. warren stagewhispers as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman , and the television camera grinds . a half-hour later , the woman is smiling and chatting ; the demon seems to have_gone . but mr. warren says_0 the woman has `` psychic burns '' on her back from the confrontation . she declines to show them . `` this was an invisible , powerful force that 's almost impossible 0 for a layman to contemplate , '' mr. warren says solemnly as the ghostbusting entourage packs up to leave . `` this time though , '' he_says , ``_i think_0 we got it .
