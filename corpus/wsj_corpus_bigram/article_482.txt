guillermo ortiz 's sept. 15 americas column , `` mexico 's been bitten by the privatization bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must_be welcomed as such by all americans who wish his country well . the mexico-united states institute is glad to see such a high official as mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries . having said that , we_must caution against an_apparent tendency to overstate the case . it is not quite true , for_example , that the mexican government has `` privatized '' mexicana de aviacion , as mr. ortiz claims 0 . in the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40_% of the total equity of the airline . how can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ? -lrb- true , the mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -rrb- regrettably , too , mr. ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer_than 392 -lcb- state enterprises -rcb- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 . '' but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . i refer essentially to petroleum , electric_power , banking and newsprint . those enterprises , however , are not_going to be privatized . they_are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution . in language that sidesteps the issue , mr. ortiz writes 0 , `` the divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of president_carlos salinas 's plan to modernize mexico 's economy ... . '' yet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can_be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . '' the bottom_line , however , is not economic but political reform . a long succession of mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without_having to answer to the public . to guarantee that mexicana de aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability . daniel james president mexico-united states institute
