although his team lost the world_series , san_francisco giants owner bob lurie hopes to have a new home for them . he is an avid fan of a proposition on next_week 's ballot 0 to help build a replacement for candlestick_park . small wonder , since he 's asking san_francisco taxpayers to sink up to $_100 million into the new stadium . as san_francisco digs out from the pretty big one , opponents say_0 the last thing 0 the city can_afford is an expensive new stadium . a stadium craze is sweeping the country . it 's fueled_by the increasing profitability of major-league teams . something like one-third of the nation_'s 60 largest cities are thinking_about new stadiums , ranging_from cleveland to san_antonio and st. petersburg . most boosters claim 0 the new sports complexes will_be moneymakers for their city . pepperdine university economist dean baim scoffs at that . he has looked_at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private dodger stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out . stadiums tend_to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it . voters generally agree when they_are given a chance to decide if_they want to sink their_own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium . san_francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two_years ago . last_month , phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $_100 million stadium bond and tax proposition . its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the chamber of commerce , the major media -- and spent $_100,000 on promotion . but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good_idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % . in san_francisco , its backers concede 0 the ballpark is at best running even in the polls . george christopher , the former san_francisco mayor who built candlestick_park for the giants in the 1960s , wo_n't endorse the new ballpark . he_says 0 he had candlestick built because the giants claimed 0 they needed 10,000 parking spaces . since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , mr. christopher thinks_0 backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their_own with the voters . stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be_built . miami dolphins owner joe robbie disagrees , and he can prove it . several_years ago he gave_up trying_to persuade miami to improve its city-owned orange bowl , and instead built his_own $_100 million coliseum with private funds . he did_n't see why the taxpayers should_help build something 0 he would then use to turn a healthy profit . `` this stadium shows that anything 0 government can_do , we_can do better , '' mr. robbie says . but to moon landrieu , the former new_orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money-losing superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom_line are of little relevance . `` the superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said . `` it is the very building of it that is important , not how_much of it is used or its economics . '' an egyptian pharaoh could_n't have justified his pyramids any better . but civilization has moved forward since_then . today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they_want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
