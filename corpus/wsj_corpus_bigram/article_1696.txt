western_union corp. took steps to withdraw its proposed debt swap for $_500 million in high-interest notes and said_0 it is looking_at other alternatives for refinancing the debt . western_union had said two_weeks ago that it might withdraw the pending offer , which would_have replaced $_500 million in so-called reset_notes , now paying 19.25 % annual_interest and set to come due in 1992 , with two new issues paying lower_interest . yesterday the company said_0 it had filed a request with the securities and exchange_commission to withdraw the registration_statement regarding the proposed swap . a western_union spokesman , citing adverse developments in the market for high-yield `` junk '' bonds , declined to say what alternatives are under_consideration . but some holders of the western_union notes expect the company to propose a more-attractive debt swap that will give_them a substantial equity_stake in the company . western_union has had major losses in recent_years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition_from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have_gone awry . the major question , said_0 one holder who asked_not to be named , is whether new_york investor bennett s. lebow , whose brooke partners controls western_union , is willing_to offer a large enough equity_stake to entice bondholders into agreeing to a new swap . the $_500 million in notes , the largest chunk of western_union 's $ 640 million in long-term_debt , stems_from the company 's major restructuring in december 1987 . the notes became burdensome when reset provisions allowed their interest_rate to be raised to 19.25 % last_june . western_union had offered to swap each $_1,000 face_amount of the notes for six shares of common_stock and two new debt issues : a $_500 note paying an interest_rate starting at 16.75 %_annually and rising in later years , due in 1992 , and a $_500 note , due in 1997 , paying a fixed rate of 17_% and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond . western_union must make $ 48 million in interest_payments on the reset_notes on dec._15 , and a company spokesman_said 0 it fully intends_to meet the payments . but western_union has said_0 it must lower the interest_rate on its debt to regain full financial health .
