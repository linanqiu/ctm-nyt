eastman_kodak co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition_television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video . the move also helps the rochester , n.y. , photographic giant ensure_that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart hdtv business . while the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number_of high-quality shows that can_be seen on the new medium . `` the industry has_been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , ''_says david niles , president of eleven twenty five productions inc. , a new_york pioneer in high-definition programming . he notes that industry_executives have until_now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with hdtvs . japanese electronic giants , such_as sony_corp. and hitachi ltd. , have focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition . and only a_handful of small u.s. companies are engaged_in high-definition software development . it 's estimated that just about 250 hours of hd programming is currently available for airing . kodak says_0 its new ccd hdtv converter will_help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video . consumers will_be able_to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the viewing benefits 0 the high-tech medium offers . otherwise , they_'d be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs . it would_be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color tv set , ''_says 0 malcolm g. saull , chairman of the film and video department at the rochester institute of technology . the new converters are `` a critical link_between film and the television domain , ''_says 0 joerg d. agin , vice_president and general_manager of kodak 's motion picture and audiovisual products division . kodak wo_n't disclose the cost or when its converter will_be on the market , but it 's estimated 0 the machine may_be available within_two years . a similar machine already on the market , made by rank sintel ltd. , a unit of rank organisation , costs about $_500,000 . and the potential market is tremendous , industry experts_say 0 . if hdtv takes off in the u.s. , there will_be demand_for some 4,000 to 5,000 hdtv converters , known in the industry as telecines . demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television_stations . `` the converter is head and shoulders above anything_else 0 i_'ve seen , ''_says richard_j. stumpf , vice_president - engineering and development at mca_inc. 's universal city studios . and mr. niles , the program producer , contends_that kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . they ca_n't afford to stay_out of hdtv . '' indeed , the stakes are high . the u.s. electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about $_150 billion over the next two_decades , with an_additional $_400 billion expected to go for related products . hdtvs break down images into more_than 1,100 lines , compared_with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . and the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen . but the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed . experts estimate 0 the first sets of hdtvs wo_n't be available for another five to 10_years , and will_probably retail for more_than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars . some critics_say 0 they wo_n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price . nevertheless , kodak could_n't risk letting hdtv turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur . `` kodak understands 0 hdtv is where everybody is going , ''_says rit 's mr. spaull .
