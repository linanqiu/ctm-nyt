regarding the oct. 3 letter to the editor from rep. tom lantos , chairman of the house_subcommittee on employment and housing , alleging : 1 . that your_sept. 28 editorial `` kangaroo committees '' was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading . i_thought 0 your_editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative . 2 . that mr._lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth_amendment . yes , he did . as i watched him on c-span , i heard 0 him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings . he did repeat those nice platitudes several_times as an_indication of his support for the constitution . he used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights . unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better_than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the fifth . he sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary . as your_editorial rightly pointed_out , samuel pierce , former hud_secretary , and lance wilson , mr._pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the fifth_amendment . '' that certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by mr._lantos . 3 . that his `` committee does_not deal_with any possible criminal activity at hud . my colleagues and i fully realize 0 we are not a court ... etc . '' absolute rubbish . by any `` reasonable man '' criterion , mr._lantos and his_colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted . apparently , their verdict is in . right_now they_'re pursuing evidence . that 's not a bad way_0 to proceed , just somewhat different from standard american practice . how was that practice referred to when i was in school ? ah , yes , something called a star chamber . of course , mr._lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . no_doubt 0 that 's partially true . everything that mr._lantos says in his letter is partially true . he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials . but if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? why_not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ? such_as , what_happened when congress wanted to know about $_400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? no , mr._lantos 's complaints simply wo_n't wash . 4 . that the journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took_place while mr._pierce was secretary of hud , '' etc. and so forth . no , to my_mind , the journal did_not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... '' it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common_sense . the problem , which the journal so rightly pointed_out in a number_of articles , is not the likes of mr._lantos , who after all is really a_bit player on the stage , but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body . -lrb- of course , we_'ve also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -rrb- the system is the problem , not an individual member . individuals can always have their hands slapped . it 's when such slapping does_n't occur that we_'ve got trouble . i_do not by any means defend hud management . but i_think 0 the kind_of congressional investigation that has_been pursued is a far_greater danger to american notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -lrb- and , yes , maybe criminality -rrb- within hud could possibly generate . the last time 0 i saw a similar congressional_hearing was when `` tail gunner joe '' mccarthy did his work . raymond weber parsippany , n.j . i disagree with the statement by mr._lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former hud officials who assert their fifth_amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings . the fifth_amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall_be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' this privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can_not comment_on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the fifth . '' the privilege , however , has_been limited in accordance with its plain language to_protect the defendant in criminal matters only . the supreme_court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the fifth_amendment does_not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' baxter v. palmingiano , 425 u.s. 308 -lrb- 1976 -rrb- . thus , in a civil case , a defendant may_be called as a witness , he may_be forced to testify or take the fifth , and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against_him in the civil matter . he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief_that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based_on a constitutional_right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could_be unconstitutionally used against_him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . thus , when mr._pierce asserted the fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief_that his testimony could_be used against_him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . the subcommittee , congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with mr._pierce 's own belief_that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional_hearing does_not offend the fifth_amendment shield against self-incrimination . clark s. spalsbury jr . estes park , colo .
