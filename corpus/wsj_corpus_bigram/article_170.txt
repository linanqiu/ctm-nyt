a # 320 million -lrb- $ 508 million -rrb- british_airways plc rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out_bid for united_airlines ' parent , ual_corp . the united_kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help_finance its $_750 million purchase of a 15_% stake_in ual . but british_airways withdrew from the ual labor-management_buy-out plan last_friday , after the group failed to get bank_financing for its $_6.79 billion buy-out . british_airways said_0 its shareholders accepted only 6.3_% of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will_be taken up by underwriters . analysts said_0 that 6.3_% level marked the poorest showing for any major british rights issue since the 1987 global stock_market crash . `` it is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said bob bucknell , an_analyst with london broker smith new court securities . `` fund_managers do_n't like to have rights issues that do_n't have an obvious reason . the obvious reason was -lrb- for british_air -rrb- to buy a stake_in united_airlines . '' in a statement , british_air chairman lord king said_0 the company was ``_obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would_have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock_market since the launch of the issue . '' but except_for the embarrassment , british_air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue . underwriters_led by lazard brothers &_co. will pick_up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common_shares . lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among u.k. institutional_investors . `` the -lrb- paper -rrb- loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed 0 john nelson , a lazard managing_director . in any_case , he_added 0 , `` most institutions probably_wo n't sell '' the bonds . and instead of buying the ual stake , the u.k. carrier will_be able_to reduce_its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest . `` from a cash_flow point of view , british_airways is better_off not being in united_airlines in the short_term , '' said andy chambers , an_analyst at nomura research_institute in london . added another u.k. analyst : `` it gives_them some cash in the back pocket for when they_want to do_something . '' for_instance , british_air is continuing to negotiate with klm royal dutch airlines about each acquiring a 20_% stake_in sabena world_airlines , the air_transport subsidiary of the belgian national airline . a_definitive agreement had_been expected by the end of july . the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact_on british_air shares . the airline 's share price already is far_below the 210 pence_-lrb- $ 3.33 -rrb- level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late_september . in late trading on london 's stock_exchange yesterday , the shares were off three pence at 194 pence . and because british_air is issuing convertible bonds rather_than ordinary_shares , the share price wo_n't be directly hurt_by any surplus left with underwriters after they try_to sell the issue in the open_market . but british_air 's withdrawal from the ual_buy-out could have further repercussions . some_analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of sir colin marshall , the carrier 's chief_executive officer . `` the stories are rubbish , '' a british_air spokesman_said . `` there_is no difference of opinion between -lrb- chairman -rrb- lord king and sir colin on any aspect of company policy .
