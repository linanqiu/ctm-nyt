the internal_revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions_against lawyers who fail to report detailed information_about clients who pay them more_than $_10,000 in cash . the warnings , issued to at_least 100 criminal_defense attorneys in several major cities in the last_week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim 0 the information is protected by attorney-client privilege . the irs warnings stem_from a 1984 law that requires anyone_who receives more_than $_10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known_as form 8300 . the form asks for such details as the client 's name , social_security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment . failure to complete the form had_been punishable as a misdemeanor until last november , when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable_by up to 10_years in prison . attorneys have argued since_1985 , when the law took_effect , that they_can not provide information_about clients who do_n't wish their identities to be known . many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent_years , citing attorney-client privilege . until last_week , the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms . `` this form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his_client , '' said neal r. sonnett , president of the national_association of criminal_defense lawyers . `` the irs is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added mr. sonnett , a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens_of attorneys who received letters in recent_days and has himself received the computer-generated irs forms sent by certified mail . mr. sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do_n't have domestic bank accounts . these individuals may_not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers . mr. sonnett said_0 there also may_be other circumstances under which individuals would n't_want the government to know 0 they had retained criminal_defense lawyers . filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action_against the clients , he said_0 . the defense_lawyers ' group formed a task_force this_week , chaired by new_york attorney gerald lefcourt , 0 to deal_with the matter . the american bar_association 's house of delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the irs reporting requirement . michael ross , a new_york lawyer who_heads the aba 's grand_jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information_about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death . mr._ross said_0 he met_with officials of the irs and the justice_department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to_discuss the issue last may . at that meeting , he said_0 , the justice_department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice . mr._ross said_0 irs officials opposed the justice_department 's moderate stance on the matter . but in the letters sent in recent_days , christopher j. lezovich of the irs computing center in detroit , told attorneys that `` failing_to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . '' in some_cases , the irs asked for information dating back to forms 0 it received in 1985 . a spokesman for the irs confirmed_that `` there has_been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now . individuals_familiar with the justice_department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last_week . lawyers worry_that if_they provide information_about clients , that data could quickly end_up in the hands of prosecutors . prosecutors need court permission to_obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business . but they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases . some criminal lawyers speculated_that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue . in a number_of recent cases , federal courts have refused_to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should_be confidential . the war over federal judicial salaries takes a victim . often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal_judge raul a. ramirez in sacramento , calif . on tuesday , the judge called a news_conference to say_0 he was quitting effective dec._31 to join a san_francisco law_firm . the reason_: the refusal of congress to give federal judges a raise . `` a couple of my law clerks were going_to pass me in three or four_years , and i was afraid 0 i was going_to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an_interview . federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in february , congress rejected a bill that would_have increased their pay by 50_% . judge ramirez , 44 , said_0 it is unjust for judges to make what they do . `` judges are not getting what they deserve . you_look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an_eye . when_you become a federal_judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . '' at his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the sacramento office of orrick , herrington & sutcliffe , he will make out much better . the judge declined to_discuss his salary in detail , but said : ``_i 'm_going to be a high-priced lawyer . '' doonesbury creator's union troubles are no laughing matter . cartoonist garry trudeau is suing the writers guild of america east for $ 11 million , alleging 0 it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line . the dispute involves darkhorse productions inc. , a tv production company in which mr._trudeau is a co-owner . mr._trudeau , a writers guild member , also was employed as a writer for darkhorse , which was covered_by a guild collective-bargaining agreement . the guild began a strike against the tv and movie industry in march 1988 . in his lawsuit , mr._trudeau says_0 the strike illegally included darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused_to honor the strike against the company . a spokesman for the guild said_0 the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit . he said_0 disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment_on whether any are_being held against mr._trudeau . mr._trudeau 's attorney , norman k. samnick , said_0 the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action . mr. samnick said_0 a guild disciplinary hearing is_scheduled next monday in new_york . mr. samnick , who will_go before the disciplinary panel , said_0 the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would_be unjustified . in_addition to the damages , the suit_seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against mr._trudeau . abortion ruling upheld : a federal_appeals court upheld a lower court_ruling that the u.s. can bar the use of federal_funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services . a department of health and human_services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called title x funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such_as abortion counseling and referrals . the rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . '' title x funds are the single largest source of federal_funding for family-planning services , according_to the opinion by the second u.s. circuit_court of appeals in new_york . the panel ruled_that the restrictions do_n't violate the freedom of speech of health_care providers and that the limits_on counseling services do_n't violate the rights of pregnant women . inquiry clears texas judge of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims . dallas district_judge jack hampton had sparked calls_for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last_december , two_weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30_years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park . the judge was_quoted as referring_to the victims as `` queers '' and saying_0 they would n't have_been killed `` if_they had n't been cruising the streets picking_up teenage boys . '' but robert r. murray , a special master appointed by the texas supreme_court , said_0 judge hampton did_n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case . observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' mr. murray concluded_that he `` would_be impartial in any_case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim . mr. murray also said_0 judge hampton 's comments did_n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice . the report is_subject to review by the state commission on judicial conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions . gaf trial goes to round three . attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of gaf corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the manhattan courtroom of u.s._district judge mary johnson lowe . in an eight-count indictment , the government has charged gaf , a wayne , n.j. , specialty chemical maker , and its vice_chairman james t. sherwin with attempting_to manipulate the common_stock of union_carbide corp. in advance of gaf 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in november 1986 . the first two gaf trials ended in mistrials earlier_this year . this trial is_expected to last five weeks . switching to the defense : a former member of the prosecution team in the iran\/contra affair joined the chicago firm of mayer , brown_& platt . michael r. bromwich , a member since_january 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of oliver_north , became a partner in the washington , d.c. , office of the 520-lawyer firm . he will specialize in white-collar criminal_defense work . mr. bromwich , 35 , also has served_as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the u.s._attorney 's office for the southern district of new_york , based in manhattan .
