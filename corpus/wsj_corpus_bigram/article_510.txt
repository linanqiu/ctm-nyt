hewlett-packard_co. will_announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed_up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each_other . called task broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . if a machine has a big computing task , task broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . it then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . hewlett-packard claims that the software allows a network to run three_times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice_as fast . the new hewlett-packard program , said_0 analyst john mccarthy at forrester research inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' in today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed . with the hewlett-packard program , he said_0 , `` you_get more bang for the buck 0 you_'ve spent on computers . '' the program , which will_be shipped in january 1990 , runs on the unix operating_system . hewlett-packard will charge $_5,000 for a license covering 10 users . the program now works on all hewlett-packard and apollo workstations and on computers made by multiflow computer inc. of branford , conn . hewlett-packard said_0 it will sell versions later next_year that run on sun_microsystems inc. and digital_equipment corp. machines . the task broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . a previously available program called network computing system , developed_by hewlett-packard 's apollo division , for_instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . but programs in individual computers must_be revised in order to work with that system . applications wo_n't have to be rewritten to work with task broker , hewlett-packard said_0 , and the user of a computer wo_n't be_able to tell that another machine is doing the work . the task broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said_0 bill kay , general_manager of hewlett-packard 's workstation group .
