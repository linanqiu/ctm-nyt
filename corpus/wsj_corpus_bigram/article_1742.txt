georgia-pacific corp. offered to_acquire great_northern nekoosa corp. for $_58 a_share , or about $_3.18 billion . the offer capped a week of rumors_that georgia-pacific , an atlanta-based forest-products company , was considering making a bid for nekoosa , a paper-products concern based in norwalk , conn . executives at nekoosa could_n't be_reached , and officials at georgia pacific declined to comment . analysts , however , were surprised because the tender_offer appeared unsolicited . `` it 's quite a bombshell , '' said one , adding_that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation . the two_companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their complementary lines , and analysts described the offer , representing a 36_% premium_over nekoosa 's market price , as fair . nekoosa closed_yesterday at $ 42.75 , up $_2.75 , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . but industry_observers still questioned whether georgia pacific will ultimately prevail . `` you have to watch out for counterbids , '' said one_analyst . `` international_paper or weyerhaeuser could step in . '' the bid for great_northern , a notice of which appears in an advertisement in today 's wall_street journal , is the first big takeover_offer since the collapse of a $_6.79 billion buy-out of united_airlines parent_ual corp. oct._13 . that collapse , following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk , high-yield bonds , cast doubt on the entire takeover business , which has fueled both big profits among wall_street securities_firms and big gains in the stock_market generally . while georgia-pacific 's stock has outperformed the market in the past_two years , nekoosa has lagged the market in the same_period . yesterday 's rise in nekoosa 's share price came on volume of 786,700 shares , four_times the daily_average . according_to dow_jones professional_investor report , options trading in nekoosa was also heavy , ranking only behind international_business machines_corp. and ual in volume on the chicago_board options_exchange . according_to the value line investment survey , demand_for nekoosa 's commodity paper has weakened , prompting earnings to decline by 6.6 % in the third_quarter ended_sept. 30 . value line added , `` with discounts widening on business papers , and with newsprint and corrugated shipments flat , we_expect negative earnings comparisons through next_year . '' by_contrast , value line said_0 georgia-pacific `` is in a comparatively good position to deal_with weakening paper markets , '' because its production is concentrated not in the northwest but in the south , where it should_be able_to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices . also , it is n't exposed to the weakening newsprint business , and is strong in the less-cyclical tissue business . the purchase of nekoosa would easily eclipse georgia-pacific 's $ 530 million acquisition of brunswick pulp & paper co. last_year . that acquisition , which also included the assumption of $ 135 million in debt , was designed to allow georgia-pacific to capitalize_on the strong_demand for softwood pulp , as_well as reduce_its exposure to the housing market . wasserstein perella &_co. is the dealer-manager for the offer , which will expire_nov. 29 , unless extended .
