as program_trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock_market gyrations , a few people on_wall street say_0 it is time 0 to consider extreme measures . the real answer to curbing wild_swings in stock_prices , they say_0 , might_be to curb or even abolish stock-index_futures . a stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market_value of a basket of stocks , such_as the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index . since stock futures were created in 1982 , trading on the chicago_mercantile exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point_where trading in stock-index_futures rivals that in the stocks themselves . the conventional view , as voiced by goldman , sachs_& co. partner fischer black , is that stocks and `` derivatives '' such_as futures and options `` form a single market , and that derivatives make it a more liquid market . '' but increasingly , people are questioning that view , and the critics include some of the country 's most_successful investors . warren buffett has_been on record as opposing stock-index_futures since their inception in 1982 . and mario gabelli , another star in the investing world , says , `` my gut says_0 the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits . '' like others , mr. gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks , they will move away_from stocks -- as many have already done . and those_who remain , he_says 0 `` will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies . '' essentially , the critics of stock-index_futures fall into two camps . one group says_0 the futures contribute to stock_market volatility ; the other contends_that futures are a sideshow of speculation_that detracts from the stock_market 's basic function of raising capital . `` before futures , ''_says new_york investor michael harkins , `` you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing 0 you were buying had any intrinsic value . '' while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock_prices , traders now routinely check the futures_markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks . when chicago futures_prices jump up or down , the new_york stock_exchange follows . on tuesday , for_instance , the dow_jones industrial_average plunged 80_points in little more_than an_hour . then , in the space of a 20-minute coffee break , the average rallied almost_all of the way back . paul lesutis , who_manages more_than $_3 billion of investments at provident capital_management inc. , blames futures_markets for leading the way . `` the fundamentals do_n't change in an_hour , '' he_says . ``_i think_0 they should close down the futures exchange and then we could_get back to investing . '' index_arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock_market volatility . although index_arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets , john bachmann , managing_partner of edward d. jones , says_0 too_much liquidity is n't a good_thing `` the kind_of instant liquidity that is implied by index_futures is that you_can buy a portfolio over two_years and get_out in one day . it 's too disruptive , '' he_says . `` it is n't investing . '' but stock-index_futures have plenty_of support . defenders say_0 futures make markets more_efficient and provide ways_0 for investors to reduce risks . they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures . and , defenders say_0 , few people complain_about futures when stock_prices are rising . louis margolis , managing_director in charge of equity options and futures at salomon inc. , says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s , a decade before the advent of futures . futures , he_says 0 , merely cut down on trading costs . he_says `` blaming futures is like blaming the messenger . '' since stock-index_arbitrage merely narrows the gap_between prices in the futures and stock_markets , it ca_n't add to volatility , he_says 0 . futures `` do_n't need defending , ''_says andrew yemma , a spokesman for the chicago_mercantile exchange , which trades the s&p_500 , by far the largest stock-index_futures contract . despite the current outcry over stock_market volatility , few people expect stock futures to disappear . for one_thing , the chicago futures_exchanges have political and financial clout --_including many friends in congress . and traders_say that futures have become an accepted part_of the financial landscape . `` all life is about change -- either you adapt or die , ''_says one chicago futures trader . `` if futures are n't permitted here , we_'ll take it to australia or tokyo . '' average_daily volume in s&p_500 futures last_year was 44,877 contracts . based_on yesterday 's closing_price of the s&p , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $_7.6 billion . by_contrast , average dollar volume on the big_board last_year was $ 5.3 billion . many investment managers_say 0 futures are useful as a way_0 to hedge portfolios . if managers fear that the overall stock_market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they_can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures_contracts . average_daily volume in s&p_500 futures last_year was 44,877 contracts . based_on yesterday 's closing_price of the s&p , the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $_7.6 billion . by_contrast , average dollar volume on the big_board last_year was $ 5.3 billion . many investment managers_say 0 futures are useful as a way_0 to hedge portfolios . if managers fear that the overall stock_market will fall , but want to continue owning stocks , they_can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures_contracts . and although criticism of futures generally comes from wall_street , one chicago futures trader notes that brokerage_firms rely_on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big_blocks of stocks from institutions . one_reason 0 futures are said to add volatility is that -- unlike in stocks -- people can speculate in futures with little money down . margin_requirements for speculators on the chicago_mercantile exchange are currently about 7_% . `` for $ 10 million , you_can move $_100 million of stocks , '' a specialist on the big_board gripes . `` that gives futures traders a_lot more power . '' by_contrast , an_investor in stocks must put_up 50_% in cash . some critics_say 0 futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity , rather_than as investments in individual businesses . thus , they say_0 , futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock_market : to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most . the s&p_500 index_futures `` transferred the identity of 500_stocks into one unit - making them a simple commodity 0 to trade , ''_says george kegler , senior_vice president at a. webster dougherty in philadelphia . `` it took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of ibm , for_example , '' mr. kegler says . of course , portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities . `` there_is a class of investor that wants to be exposed '' to the whole market , says sandip bhagat , assistant vice_president at travelers investment_management co . the s&p_futures are merely a `` cheaper and quicker '' way_0 to get access to all 500_stocks , he_says 0 . the big_board yesterday began trading in its_own basket trading vehicle representing the s&p_500 stocks . but owning index_futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks . stockholders , as a group , can win , because_they own a_share of corporate earnings , which can grow and boost stock_prices . futures , on the other_hand , are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock_prices . `` you_do n't own anything , ''_says stephen_boesel , a money_manager for t._rowe price in baltimore . `` you_'re making a pure bet on the market .
