the stock of ual_corp. continued to be pounded amid signs that british_airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $_6.79 billion buy-out of united_airlines ' parent . ual_stock plummeted a further $ 24.875 to $ 198 on volume of more_than 2.8_million shares in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . the plunge followed a drop of $ 56.875 monday , amid indications 0 the takeover may take weeks to be revived . the stock has_fallen $ 87.25 , or 31 % , in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $_300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock_market into its second-worst plunge ever . `` this is a total bloodbath '' for takeover-stock_traders , one investment_banker said_0 . los_angeles financier marvin_davis , who put united in play with a $ 5.4_billion bid two_months ago , last_night proffered both a ray of hope and an_extra element of uncertainty by saying_0 he remains interested_in acquiring ual . but he dropped his earlier $_300-a-share back-up bid , saying_0 he must first explore bank_financing . even as citicorp and chase_manhattan corp. scrambled to line up bank_financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management_bid , british_airways , a 15_% partner in the buying group , indicated 0 it wants to start from scratch . its partners are united 's pilots , who were to own 75_% , and ual management at 10_% . adding insult to injury , united 's 25,000-member machinists_' union , which helped scuttle financing for the first bid , yesterday asked ual chairman_stephen wolf and other ual directors to resign . a similar demand was made by a group that represents some of united 's 26,000 noncontract employees . john peterpaul , machinists_union general vice_president , attacked mr._wolf as `` greedy and irresponsible '' for pursuing the buy-out . although mr._wolf and john pope , ual 's chief_financial officer , stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out , ual executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company . the blue-collar machinists , longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots , say_0 the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances . confusion about the two banks ' hurried efforts 0 to round up financing for a new bid that the ual_board has n't even seen yet helped send ual_stock spiraling downward . and rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock_traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the dow_jones industrial_average around 11:15 a.m._edt yesterday . yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news_agency reported that japanese_banks , which balked_at the first bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around $_250 a_share , or $ 5.65 billion . several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up . citicorp , for_example , said only that it had `` expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks , '' but did_n't have an_agreement . late in the day , mr._wolf issued a onepage statement calling mr. peterpaul 's blast `` divisive and uncalled for . '' but he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid , saying only , ``_we are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership . '' meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was learned that the ual_board held a telephone meeting monday to hear an update on the situation , but that a formal board_meeting is n't likely_to be convened until early_next week . in london , british_airways chairman lord king was_quoted in the times as declaring 0 he is `` not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal . '' observers said_0 it appeared that british_air was angered at the way_0 the bid has degenerated into confusion , as_well as by the banks ' effort 0 to round up financing for what one called `` a deal that is n't a deal . '' the effort 0 to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group . the pilots were meeting outside chicago yesterday . but british_air , which was to have supplied $_750 million out of $ 965 million in equity financing , apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even_if banks obtain_financing . a group of united 's noncontract employees said in a statement , `` the fact_that wolf and other officers were going_to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of united is not_only deplorable but inexcusable . '' the machinists also asked for an_investigation by the securities and exchange_commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for ual by mr._davis , as_well as in the response by ual . last_week , just before the bank commitments were due , the union asked the u.s. labor_department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds . in his statement , mr._wolf said , ``_we continue to believe_0 our approach is sound , and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same . '' mr._wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major wall_street securities_firm , relying instead only on a takeover lawyer , peter atkins of skadden arps slate meagher & flom . the huge drop in ual_stock prompted one takeover_stock trader , george kellner , managing_partner of kellner , dileo &_co. , to deny publicly rumors_that his firm was going out of business . mr. kellner said that despite losses on ual_stock , his firm 's health is `` excellent . '' the stock 's decline also has left the ual_board in a quandary . although it may_not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out_group ca_n't revive its bid , it may_have to explore alternatives if the buyers come_back with a bid much lower_than the group 's original $_300-a-share proposal . at a meeting sept. 1 to consider the labor-management_bid , the board also was informed by its investment_adviser , first_boston corp. , of interest expressed by buy-out funds including kohlberg_kravis roberts &_co. and forstmann little &_co. , as_well as by robert_bass , morgan_stanley 's buy-out fund , and pan_am corp . the takeover-stock_traders were hoping that mr._davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray , or that the board might consider a recapitalization . meanwhile , japanese bankers said_0 they_were still hesitant about accepting citicorp 's latest proposal .
