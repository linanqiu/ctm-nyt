california legislators , searching_for ways_0 to pay for the $_4 billion to $_6 billion in damages from last_week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax . the talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from congress on the question of how_much the federal_government is willing_to spend to aid in california 's earthquake relief efforts . the state had_sought as_much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the house approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $_2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to california , with an unspecified amount going_to regions affected_by hurricane_hugo . that leaves the state roughly $_2 billion to $_4 billion short . a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest 0 to raise funds in a hurry . according_to the state_department of finance , a one-penny increase in the state 's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $_3 billion . willie brown , speaker of california 's assembly , said that gov. george deukmejian has_agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within_two weeks . california 's so-called gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an_emergency . both mr. brown , the state 's most influential legislator , and gov. deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal_government . according_to a spokesman , the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes . mr. brown , meanwhile , believes_0 `` only one tax will_be feasible , and it will_be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said chuck dalldorf , an_aide . one immediate source of money is an_emergency fund set_up by gov. deukmejian . the fund has about $_1 billion and is set_up to handle `` precisely the kind_of emergency '' 0 the state faces , said_0 tom beermann , the governor 's deputy press_secretary . but the fund 's size is disputed by mr. brown 's office , which estimates 0 the fund holds from $ 630 million to $_800 million . moreover , an_aide to mr. brown said_0 gov. deukmejian `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this . '' to push through a sales tax increase , however , the state will have to suspend the gann limit , citing an_emergency . and then it will_be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends , said_0 cindy katz , assistant director of the state_department of finance . a sales tax increase would_require two-thirds approval in both_houses of the state 's legislature . but observers expect broad support . `` if there 's an_emergency and there_are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , i_think 0 the attitude will_be supportive , '' said kirk west , president of the california chamber of commerce . but others think_0 property owners ought_to pay a higher portion_of the state 's earthquake relief tab . since the late_1970s , california property owners have benefited_from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known_as proposition 13 . the state could also increase gasoline taxes ; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ 11 million a month . but gov. deukmejian and others are_reluctant to do_anything 0 to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis . to raise more highway_funds , a measure 0 to double the state 's nine-cent a gallon tax over five_years is set to appear on the state 's june election ballot . but some fear 0 imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure . not_everyone is convinced 0 the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs . `` it 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could_get by with its existing resources and federal help , said quentin kopp , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee . separately , two_men injured in last_week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in oakland began a legal_battle against the state over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety . the claims , which were filed with the state board of control but will_probably end_up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called cypress structure viaduct . the men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes . a board of control spokesman_said 0 the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .
