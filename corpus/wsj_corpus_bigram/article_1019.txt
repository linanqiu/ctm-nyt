when maj. moises giroldi , the leader of the abortive coup in panama , was buried , his body bore several gunshot wounds , a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs . they_were the signature of his adversary , panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega . the rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of panama 's battalion-2000 squad , was personally supervised by gen._noriega , says_0 a u.s. official with access to intelligence reports . leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , mr._noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according_to u.s. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in panama city . he is now changing the place 0 he sleeps every night , sometimes more_than once a night . his meals are most often prepared by women 0 he trusts -- his full-time mistress , vicky amado , and her_mother , norma . and he is collecting the names of those_who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters . more enemies 0 to be dealt with . in the two_weeks since the rebellion , which the u.s. hesitantly backed , mr._noriega has_been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power . yet , while the failed_coup is a major u.s. foreign_policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship_between mr._noriega and washington that stretches back three decades . america 's war on the dictator over the past_two years , following his indictment on drug charges in february_1988 , is the legacy of that relationship . before american foreign_policy set out to destroy noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of panama 's long_history of conspirators and pirates . for most of the past_30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . in 1960 , for_example , when mr._noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in peru and a spy-in-training for the u.s. defense intelligence_agency , he was detained by lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according_to a u.s._embassy cable from that period . the woman had nearly died . but u.s. intelligence , rather_than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away . mr._noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more_important to u.s. interests . from that point on , the u.s. would make a practice of overlooking the panamanian 's misadventures . the u.s. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful . the 55-year-old mr._noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of iran , as well-born as nicaragua 's anastasio somoza , as imperial as ferdinand marcos of the philippines or as bloody as haiti 's baby doc duvalier . yet he has proved more resilient than any of them . and out of necessity : the u.s. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . `` the u.s. underestimated noriega all along , ''_says ambler moss , a former ambassador to panama . `` he has mastered the art of survival . '' in keeping with america 's long_history of propping up mr._noriega , recent u.s. actions have extended rather_than shortened his survival . mr._noriega might_have fallen of his_own weight in 1988 because of panama 's dire economic situation , says_0 mr. moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his_own mismanagement . `` if the u.s. had sat back and done nothing , he might_not have made it through 1988 , '' mr. moss contends . perhaps most_important , mr._noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some_cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . one colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that gen._noriega was negotiating_with the u.s. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his_name . `` he is cornered , ''_says the rev. fernando guardia , who has led catholic church opposition against noriega . `` the americans have left him without a way out . it is easy to fight when_you do_n't have any other option . '' his chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses . mr._noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation . the u.s. discovered the young tony noriega in late 1959 , when he was in his second year at the chorrillos military academy in lima , according_to former u.s. intelligence officials . the contact occurred through mr._noriega 's half-brother , a panamanian diplomat based in peru named luis carlos noriega hurtado . luis carlos , knowing that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer , relayed tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies 0 he observed among his_fellow students and , more_important , among his officers and instructors . a spy was_born . it was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built mr._noriega , who was known to his friends as cara la pina -- pineapple face . born the illegitimate son of his_father 's maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city . tony was four_years older than most of his_fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate . he considered himself intellectually superior to his peruvian peers , many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined , french-modeled academy as a sort of reform school . in his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , french-made uniform , noriega felt more respected and powerful than_ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say_0 . `` he had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls darien ayala , a fellow student in peru and a lifelong friend . mr._noriega 's relationship to american intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials_say 0 . his commanding officer at the chiriqui province garrison , major omar torrijos , gave_him an intriguing assignment : mr._noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service . the spy network would serve two clients : the panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the u.s. , by tracking the growing communist influence in the unions organized at united fruit co. 's banana plantations in bocas del toros and puerto armuelles . united fruit was one of the two largest contributors to panama 's national income . satisfying its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader . mr._noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $_100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the american px , a former intelligence official says_0 . it was modest pay by american standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $_300 to $_400 monthly . `` he did it very_well , '' recalls boris martinez , a former panamanian colonel who managed mr._noriega and his operation . `` he started building the files that helped him gain power . '' a national guard job assumed by capt. noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in david city , capital of the chiriqui province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . by pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . he knew which local luminaries had_been caught driving drunk , which had_been found with their mistresses . this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in 1967 , when union_leaders were planning a may day march that the government feared 0 could turn violent . mr._noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy . so he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of puerto armuelles , which was ruled by united fruit co . the campaign so divided union_leaders that the government found them far easier 0 to control . `` it was like a play on broadway , '' recalls mr. martinez . `` noriega managed the whole thing . he was superb . noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . '' during his years in chiriqui , however , mr._noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious . rodrigo miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th zone garrison headquarters in david , where he had his offices . mr._noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . `` people started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' mr. miranda recalls . but through this period , so_far as the u.s. military was concerned , mr._noriega was a model recruit . he signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under american officers at fort gulick in panama in july 1967 , according_to a copy of a 1983 resume with details 0 mr._noriega has since classified as secret . he flew to fort bragg , n.c. , in_september of that year for a course in psychological operations , returning to the school of the americas in panama for a two-month course called `` military intelligence for officers . '' some american officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they_did so falsely . he rose to chief of intelligence in panama 's socalled g-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup_attempt against_him a year_earlier . he became gen. torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all panama 's secrets . mr._noriega , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the cubans -- not to mention the israelis , the taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking . when u.s. diplomats complained to the cia of col. noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted_that his allegiance was first to the americans . `` early on in the state_department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability_to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of cuba and the united_states , '' recalls francis j. mcneil , who , as deputy assistant_secretary of state for inter-american affairs , first ran across reports about mr._noriega in 1977 . `` some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so_much stock in his information when he was just as close to the cubans . '' even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns . during the nixon administration , the drug enforcement administration became dismayed at the extent of the g-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . one dea agent drew up a list of five options for dealing_with col. noriega , one of which was assassination . the head of the dea at the time , john ingersoll , scotched the assassination plan . but he did fly to panama to scold dictator torrijos on the drug ties of panamanian officials , including mr._noriega . mr. ingersoll later recalled that gen. torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s. . `` everybody was afraid of him , '' mr. ingersoll says . mr._noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when u.s. intelligence services discovered that he had_been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the u.s. army 's 470th military intelligence group . the tapes included wiretaps of gen. torrijos 's own phone , according_to american intelligence officials . ``_we caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , ''_says former cia director stansfield turner . for the first_time , the u.s. considered cutting mr._noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , mr. turner says_0 . `` in the world of intelligence , if_you want to get information , you_get it from seedy characters . the question is how_much you_get tied in with seedy characters so they_can extort you . '' intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr._noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the cubans or others . mr. turner was troubled enough to cancel the u.s. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the carter administration . the u.s. soon found new cause for concern : gun-running . prosecutors in southern florida indicted five panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to sandinista rebels trying_to overthrow the nicaraguan government of mr. somoza . they included one of mr._noriega 's closest friends and business partners , carlos wittgreen . and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr._noriega himself . at the time , though , in 1979 , the u.s. was once_again flirting with its longtime latin_american spy . mr._noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon . dade county and federal authorities , learning that he intended_to fly through miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as_soon as he hit u.s. soil . it was a friday in june . the pentagon foiled the plan . according_to military officers at the time , word was passed to mr._noriega by his american hosts that the police would_be waiting . on monday , u.s. officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in panama . `` due to health reasons , lt. col. noriega has elected to postpone his visit to washington , '' it read . prosecutors in miami received yet_another setback . their original indictment against mr. wittgreen , the friend of mr._noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality . but now , along_with reindicting mr._noriega 's pal , they intended_to charge mr._noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $_2 million in arms . in january 1980 , jerome sanford , as assistant_u.s. attorney , was summoned to a meeting with a federal_bureau of investigation agent assigned to the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms in miami . panamanian dictator torrijos , he was told 0 , had granted the shah of iran asylum in panama as a favor to washington . mr. sanford was told 0 mr._noriega 's friend , mr. wittgreen , would_be handling the shah 's security . it would n't be a good_idea to indict him -- much_less mr._noriega , the prosecutor was told 0 . after prodding from mr. sanford , u.s._attorney jack eskenazi pleaded with justice_department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed . `` unfortunately , '' mr. eskenazi wrote 0 in a letter , `` those of us in law_enforcement in miami find ourselves frequently attempting_to enforce the laws of the united_states but simultaneously being caught between foreign_policy considerations over which we have no control . '' the letter , along_with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death . ``_i think_0 if we had_been allowed to go_ahead then we would n't have the problems 0 we have now , '' mr. sanford says . `` if he had_been found_guilty , we could have stopped him . '' in_august 1983 , mr._noriega took_over as general and de-facto dictator of panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two_years after the mysterious death in a plane_crash of his old boss omar torrijos . soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses . the reagan_administration also put mr._noriega 's g-2 back on the u.s. payroll . payments averaged nearly $_200,000 a year from the u.s. defense intelligence_agency and the cia . although working for u.s. intelligence , mr._noriega was hardly helping the u.s. exclusively . during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas . he allegedly entered into panama 's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses , according_to floyd carlton , a pilot who once worked for mr._noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand_jury in miami that would ultimately indict the panamanian on drug charges . but mr._noriega was convinced 0 the reagan white_house would n't act against_him , recalls 0 his close ally jose blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the contra_rebels in nicaragua . mr. blandon says_0 the general allowed the contras to set_up a secret training center in panama . mr._noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaraguan capital of managua . and on at_least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a sandinista arsenal in nicaragua . although , his help for the contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the reagan_administration , says_0 sen. patrick leahy , a vermont democrat who then served on the senate_intelligence committee . `` noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a violin , '' he_says . an incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which mr._noriega might_have maintained such influence with washington -- by compromising u.s. officials . curtin windsor , then the ambassador to costa_rica , recalls being invited to panama by mr._noriega 's brother luis carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the aswara peninsula . mr. windsor notified everett e. briggs , the u.s._ambassador to panama , of the invitation . `` briggs screamed , '' mr. windsor recalls . he_says 0 mr. briggs told_him 0 he was being set_up for a `` honey trap , '' in which mr._noriega would try_to involve him in an orgy and then record the event `` with sound and video . '' mr. briggs , on vacation after resigning his_position at the national_security council , could_n't be_reached for comment . as mr._noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the contras , an_apparent attempt_to curry more favor in washington . for_instance , he helped steal the may 1984 panamanian elections for the ruling_party . but just one_month later , he also contributed $_100,000 to a contra leader , according_to documents released for oliver_north 's criminal trial in washington , d.c . yet , his political setbacks mounted . mr._noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of hugo spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man 0 to publicly finger mr._noriega on drug trafficking charges . he then ousted president nicholas ardito barletta , a former world bank official with close ties to the u.s. , after mr. barletta tried_to create a commission to investigate the murder . and , all the while , panama 's debt problems continued to grow . mr._noriega was growing desperate . in late 1986 , he made an offer 0 he thought_0 the u.s. could_n't refuse . as recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the north trial , mr._noriega offered to assassinate the sandinista leadership in exchange `` for a promise to help clean_up noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the -lcb- u.s. . -rcb- ban_on military sales to the panamanian defense forces . '' `` north , '' the document went on , referring_to oliver_north , `` has told noriega 's representative that u.s. law forbade such actions . the representative responded that noriega had numerous assets in place in nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things , just as noriega had helped -lcb- the u.s. . -rcb- the previous_year in blowing up a sandinista arsenal . '' col. north conveyed the request to his superiors and to assistant_secretary of state elliot abrams , who relayed it to secretary of state george shultz . mr._noriega 's proposal was turned_down . and mr. shultz curtly told mr. abrams that the general should_be told that only he could repair his tarnished image . the end of the marriage was at hand . within weeks the unfolding iran-contra scandal took away mr._noriega 's insurance policy . the death of cia director william casey and resignation of oliver_north allowed anti-noriega political forces to gain influence . public protests against_him were triggered in june 1987 due to charges by diaz herrera , his former chief of staff , that mr._noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of messrs. spadafora and torrijos . few american officials were_willing any longer to defend him . lawyers in miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in february_1988 . during negotiations_with american officials in may 1988 over proposals to drop the u.s. indictments in exchange for his_resignation , mr._noriega often asked almost plaintively how the americans , whom he had helped for so_many years , could turn against_him . now , neither_side -- the u.s. nor mr._noriega -- has an easy out . president_bush has sworn to bring him to justice . mr._noriega believes_0 he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power . it is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death . in the end , is mr._noriega the political equivalent of frankenstein 's monster , created_by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ? not quite , sen. leahy contends_0 . `` for short-term gains , people were_willing to put_up with him . that allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he_says . ``_i do_n't think_0 we created him as_much as we fed him , nurtured him and let_him grow up to be big and strong .
