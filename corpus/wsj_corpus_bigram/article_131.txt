'' however , mr. moran added that the japanese generally have a positive view of the u.s. bond_market because of expectations that the dollar will_remain strong and interest_rates will decline . he said , `` possibly , they_'re waiting to buy at the -lrb- quarterly -rrb- refunding '' of government debt 0 to be held next_month by the treasury . a trader_at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more_than 10_% of the two-year_notes . treasury , agency securities today investors will focus_on the long-awaited auction of $_4.5 billion of 30-year_bonds by resolution_funding corp . the initial bond_offering by the new government agency , which was created to help rescue the nation_'s troubled thrifts , is n't expected to see robust demand . a small yield premium_over comparable treasurys and a lack_of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts to drum_up interest in the so-called bailout bonds . in when-issued_trading , the refcorp bonds were_quoted at a price 0 to yield 8.17 % . yesterday , the benchmark_30-year bond was_quoted late at_102 18\/32 0 to yield 7.89 % , compared_with 102 9\/32 0 to yield 7.93_% on monday . the latest_10-year treasury was_quoted at 100 22\/32 0 to yield 7.88_% , compared_with 100 17\/32 0 to yield 7.9 % . short-term_rates were_unchanged to slightly_lower . the discount_rate on three-month_treasury bills was_quoted at 7.52_% for a bond-equivalent_yield of 7.75_% , while the rate on_six-month treasury_bills was_quoted at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % . rates are determined_by the difference_between the purchase_price and face_value . thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . corporate issues several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take_advantage of falling interest_rates . three of the largest offerings , by exxon capital corp. , xerox corp. and citicorp , were underwritten_by groups led_by salomon_brothers inc . exxon capital , long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer , offered $_200 million of 10-year_notes priced to yield 8.31 % . citicorp issued $_200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82 % , and xerox priced $_150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85 % . meanwhile , international_business machines_corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the securities and exchange_commission for $_800 million in new debt . this is in_addition to ibm 's existing shelf registration under which $_200 million in debt_securities are available for issuance . in secondary trading , investment-grade_corporate bonds_ended 1\/8 to 1\/4 higher . municipals actively traded municipal_bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2_point higher in brisk trading , despite a flood of new supply . new_jersey turnpike authority 's 7.20_% issue of 2018 finished 1\/4_point stronger at_98 1\/2 bid , 0 to yield 7.32 % . traders_said 0 municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in treasury issue prices . also , municipal_bonds lured buying because the stock_market remains wobbly , traders contended 0 . mainly , though , it was a favorable outlook for yesterday 's new supply that propped up municipals , some traders_said 0 . among the new issues was massachusetts 's $ 230 million of general_obligation bonds . the bonds were won by a goldman , sachs_& co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17 % . they_were priced to yield from 6.00 % in 1990 to 7.20_% in 2009 . the massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $ 84.3 million in late trading , the underwriter said_0 . mortgage - , asset-backed_securities mortgage_securities gained 3\/32 to 9\/32 point after a hectic session , with government national_mortgage association 8_% securities as the standout issue . the ginnie_mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional_investors . the derivative_markets remained active as one new issue was_priced and talk circulated about more offerings in the next day or two . the federal_home loan_mortgage corp. issued a $_500 million real_estate mortgage investment conduit backed_by its 8_1\/2 % securities . in the asset-backed market , a big offering of ford_motor credit corp . auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand . the deal by the ford_motor co._unit , priced monday , was increased to $ 3.05 billion from $ 2.58 billion . among major pass-through issues , ginnie_mae 9_% securities for november_delivery ended at_98 15\/32 , up 5\/32 , after touching an early high of 98 27\/32 ;_8 % securities were at 94 5\/32 , up 9\/32 ;
