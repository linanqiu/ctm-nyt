institut_merieux s.a. of france said_0 the canadian_government raised an obstacle to its proposed_acquisition of connaught biosciences inc. for 942 million_canadian dollars_-lrb- us$ 801.6 million -rrb- . merieux said_0 the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is_likely to be of `` net benefit '' to canada . canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard . the french company said_0 the government gave it 30_days in which to submit information 0 to further support its takeover plan . both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns . the government 's action was unusual . alan nymark , executive_vice president of investment canada , which_oversees foreign takeovers , said_0 it marked the first_time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly_traded company . he said_0 it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts_to buy closely_held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . `` this is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has_been used before , '' said jodi redmond , press_secretary for harvie andre , canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . mr. andre issued the ruling based_on a recommendation by investment canada . spokesmen for merieux and connaught said_0 they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada , but added 0 they hope to have more information early this_week . investment canada declined to comment_on the reasons for the government decision . viren mehta , a partner with mehta & isaly , a new_york-based pharmaceutical industry research_firm , said_0 the government 's ruling was n't unexpected . `` this has_become a very politicized deal , concerning canada 's only large , world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company , '' mr. mehta said . mr. mehta said_0 the move that could allow the transaction to go_ahead as planned could_be an out-of-court settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto . the university is_seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns_about the amount of research that would_be done in canada . the university is_considering a settlement proposal made by connaught . while neither_side will disclose its contents , mr. mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada . some_analysts , such_as murray grossner of toronto-based richardson greenshields inc. , believe_0 the government ruling leaves the door open for other_bidders , such_as switzerland 's ciba-geigy and chiron corp. of emeryville , calif . officials for the two concerns , which are bidding c$ 30 a_share for connaught , could_n't be_reached for comment . french state-owned rhone-poulenc s.a. holds 51_% of merieux .
