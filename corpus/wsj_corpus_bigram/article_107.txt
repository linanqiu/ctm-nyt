the airline industry 's fortunes , in dazzling shape for most of the year , have_taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past_few weeks . citing rising fuel costs , promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel , several major carriers have posted or are_expected to post relatively poor third-quarter_results . yesterday , usair_group inc. , recently one of the industry 's stellar performers , posted a worse-than-expected $ 77.7 million net_loss for the period . so_far , the industry 's fourth_quarter is n't looking too strong either , prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as_much as one-fourth . and they say_0 the outlook for 1990 is nearly as bad . airlines in 1989 `` came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper , '' said_0 kevin murphy , an airline analyst_at morgan_stanley &_co . this turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last_spring , when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets . now , many airline companies might become a_lot less attractive as takeover_targets on_wall street . the downturn also raises_questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes , which currently total $ 32.5 billion over the next three_years . for travelers , though , the industry 's problems have had some positive effects . in recent_weeks , airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try_to win back customers . others have tried_to spruce up frequent-flier programs . previously , airlines were limiting the programs because_they were becoming too expensive . just last_week , for_example , trans_world airlines and pan_am corp. 's pan_american world airways went so_far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $_200 to $_1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-atlantic flights in business class or first class . the industry 's slowdown became_apparent this_month when amr_corp. , parent of american_airlines , reported an 8.8_% drop in third-quarter_net income and said_0 its fourth_quarter would_be `` disappointing . '' shortly_before that , usair had said_0 its third-quarter_results would_be `` significantly_lower '' than a year_earlier . yesterday , it provided the details : its loss of $ 77.7 million , or $ 1.86 a_share , contrasted with net of $ 68.5 million , or $ 1.58 a_share , in the 1988_third quarter . revenue_rose only 3.3_% in the latest_period , to $ 1.53 billion from $ 1.48 billion . for the nine_months , the arlington , va. , company 's net plunged 73 % to $ 38.5 million , or 76 cents_a share , from $ 142.2 million , or $ 3.28 a_share . revenue_rose 12_% to $_4.75 billion from $ 4.22 billion . the results surprised many analysts , because usair has almost no competition in its pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of piedmont airlines . shortly_after announcing its_quarterly loss , usair 's stock tumbled $_3 a_share . it ended at $ 40.125 , down $ 2.375 , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . `` nobody was expecting this size of a loss , '' said paul karos , an_analyst with first_boston corp . one airline executive , who declined to be_identified , called the loss `` amazing . '' in announcing the results , usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently . it said_0 the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third_quarter ; analysts_say 0 this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this_summer . to try_to combat the traffic slowdown , airlines started reducing fares ; average fares rose only 1.7_% in_august , in contrast to increases of 16_% each in february and march . but so_far , the effort has failed , and traffic is still slow . some other fare promotions have backfired . this_summer , the industry introduced a `` kids fly free '' program , in which children were allowed to fly free if_they were traveling with an adult . airlines tried_to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week , but it still was apparently used far_more heavily than the airlines expected 0 . airlines also say_0 their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are_being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate . one airline official said_0 about three_times as many free-travel coupons are_being turned in as in previous years -- not surprisingly , as the airlines last_year allowed many travelers to build up mileage at triple the normal rate . rising operating_expenses are another problem . fuel costs were up 10_% in the third_quarter . labor_costs , which leveled off in the past_few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees , are on the upswing again at many carriers . and some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches : usair , for_example , blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused_by hurricane_hugo last_month . ``_we can_not quantify the total adverse effects of hugo , '' said edwin colodny , chairman and president of usair_group . whatever the cause for the downturn , few people are predicting any sudden improvement . airline economics inc. , an aviation consulting_firm , is projecting an industrywide operating_profit of $_2.5 billion for 1989 , compared_with earlier forecasts of $_3 billion to $ 3.5 billion . as for 1990 , the firm predicts 0 that profit will slip to between $_1 billion and $_1.5 billion .
