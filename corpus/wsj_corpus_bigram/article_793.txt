digital_equipment corp. is planning a big coming-out party on tuesday for its first line of mainframe_computers . but an uninvited guest is_expected to try_to crash the party . on the morning of the long-planned announcement , international_business machines_corp. is to introduce its_own new mainframe . `` their attitude is , ` you_want to talk mainframes , we_'ll talk mainframes , ' ''_says one computer_industry executive . `` they_'re deliberately trying_to steal our thunder , '' a digital executive complains . `` maybe we should take it as a compliment . '' digital 's target is the $_40 billion market for mainframe_computers , the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business . ibm , based in armonk , n.y. , has dominated the market for decades . that does_n't scare digital , which has_grown to be the world 's_second-largest computer_maker by poaching customers of ibm 's mid-range machines . digital , based in maynard , mass. , hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes , and it has spent almost $_1 billion developing the new technology . a spoiler , nimble tandem_computers inc. in cupertino , calif. , jumped into the fray earlier_this week with an aggressively priced entry . ibm appears more worried_about digital , which has a broad base of customers waiting_for the new line , dubbed the vax 9000 . `` it 's going_to be nuclear war , ''_says thomas willmott , a consultant with aberdeen group inc . the surge in competition is_expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market , where growth has slowed to single digits in recent_years . ibm 's traditional mainframe rivals , including unisys corp. , control_data corp. and ncr corp. , have struggled recently . digital is promising a new approach . robert_m. glorioso , digital 's vice_president for high performance systems , says_0 digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves , but as_part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds_of workstations , personal_computers , printers and other devices . and unlike ibm 's water-cooled mainframes , it_does n't need any plumbing . the challengers will have a big price advantage . digital is_expected to tag its new line from about $_1.24 million to $ 4.4_million and up , depending_on configuration . that 's about_half the price of comparably equipped ibm mainframes . tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive . the heightened competition will hit ibm at a difficult time . the computer_giant 's current mainframe line , which has sold well and has huge profit_margins , is starting to show its age . the new 3090s due next_week will boost performance by only about 8_% to 10_% . and ibm is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991 . still , no_one expects ibm 's rivals to deliver a knockout . ibm has a near-monopoly on mainframes , with an_estimated 70_% share of the market . ibm is five_times the size of digital -- and 40 times the size of tandem -- and wields enormous market power . it counts among its customers a majority of the world 's_largest corporations , which entrust their most critical business information to ibm computers . ``_we 're_not going_to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an ibm mainframe , '' concedes kenneth h. olsen , digital 's president . he_says 0 digital will target faster-growing market segments such_as on-line transaction processing , which_includes retail-sales tracking , airline reservations and bank-teller networks . tandem , which already specializes_in on-line transaction processing , is a potent competitor in that market . a key marketing target for digital will_be the large_number of big customers who already_own both digital and ibm systems . one such company is bankers_trust co . stanley rose , a vice_president , technological and strategic planning at bankers_trust , says that despite digital 's low prices , ``_we are n't about to unplug our ibm mainframes for a dec machine . the software conversion costs would dwarf any savings . '' but mr. rose is still looking seriously at the 9000 . bankers_trust uses digital 's vax to run its huge money-transfer and capital_markets accounts , juggling hundreds_of billions of dollars each day , he_says 0 . as that system grows , larger computers may_be needed . `` in the past , customers had to go to ibm when they outgrew the vax . now they do_n't have to , '' he_says . `` that 's going_to cost ibm revenue . '' analysts_say 0 digital can expect this pent-up demand_for the new vax to fuel strong_sales next_year . barry f. willman , an_analyst at sanford c. bernstein &_co. , estimates 0 the 9000 could boost sales by more_than $_1 billion in the fiscal_year beginning in july . he bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds_of digital 's_largest customers . although digital will_announce a full family of mainframes next_week , it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next_year . the first model available will_be the 210 , which is_likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested_in the optional super-charger , or vector processor , says_0 terry shannon of international data corp. , a market research concern . four more models , aimed squarely at ibm 's commercial customers , are_expected to begin shipping in late june . most analysts do_n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal_first quarter , which begins next july 1 . digital 's new line has_been a long time coming . the company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product , and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an_interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end . digital 's failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may_have cost the company as_much as $_1 billion in revenue in fiscal_1989 , mr. willman says_0 . ibm will face still more competition in coming_months . amdahl corp. , backed_by japan 's fujitsu_ltd. , has a growing share of the market with its low-priced , ibm-compatible machines . and national advanced systems , a joint_venture of japan 's hitachi ltd. and general_motors corp. 's electronic data_systems , is_expected to unveil a line of powerful ibm-compatible mainframes later_this year . note : nas is national advanced systems , cdc -- control_data corp. , bull nh information systems_inc . source_: international data corp . compiled_by publishers weekly from data from large-city bookstores , bookstore chains and local bestseller lists across the u.s. . copyright 1989 by reed publishing usa .
