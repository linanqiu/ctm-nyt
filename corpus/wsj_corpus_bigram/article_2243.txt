house and senate conferees agreed_to continue production of grumman_corp. 's f-14 and to provide more_than $_3.8 billion for the strategic_defense initiative during the current_fiscal year . industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past_few days , provide a face-saving compromise for both the white_house and house democrats . although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package , the final agreement could_be announced as early as tomorrow . an announcement is more likely next_week , though . president_bush and other supporters of sdi will_be able_to take credit for blocking house efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system , which already_has cost some $ 17 billion . senate armed services committee_chairman sam nunn -lrb-_d. , ga . -rrb- and other senate conferees have opposed the house cuts , stalling for almost two_months action on a number_of big-ticket items in the pentagon 's budget . the senate voted to authorize $_4.5 billion for sdi spending in the current_fiscal year , but the house , reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program , earmarked only $_3.1 billion . despite the widening gap_between the two_sides , conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference . that would hold spending on the program at about the previous_year 's level . the decision to_keep the embattled f-14 's production line running for at_least another year is an_important victory for the house , and especially for rep. les aspin -lrb-_d. , wis . -rrb- . as the head of the house conferees , rep. aspin has_been under intense pressure_from his_colleagues to reject senate provisions that would_have abruptly cut further f-14 production . the package `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for grumman , '' according_to one congressional aide familiar_with the closed-door bargaining . but as_part of the overall agreement , grumman and its outspoken supporters on_capitol hill effectively will_be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate_over next_year 's budget . defense_secretary dick cheney and most senators contend_that the navy 's f-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking pentagon budgets . but the plane boasts a strong core of support in the house , where members are intent on saving grumman jobs and are worried_about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s . conferees also agreed_to pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $_1 billion for work on both mobile mx and midgetman nuclear missiles , according_to congressional aides . and lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would_give the air_force nearly all of the $_2.4 billion 0 it wants for production of northrop corp. 's radar-eluding b-2 bombers , which cost $ 530 million apiece . the final b-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber 's capabilities , but congressional aides said_0 the accord wo_n't include a house-passed provision that would_have withheld production funds until congress approves a cheaper , scaled-down version of the $_70 billion fleet of 132 b-2s envisioned by the pentagon .
