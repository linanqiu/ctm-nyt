several of the new_york stock_exchange 's own listed companies , led_by giant contel corp. , are joining for the first_time to complain_about program_trading and the exchange 's role in it . claiming 0 program_trading has_turned the big_board into a `` gambling casino , '' contel chairman charles wohlstetter said that he and at_least 20 other corporate executives are forming an_unprecedented alliance . the group , mr. wohlstetter said_0 in an_interview , wants to end the market 's wild price_swings that critics blame on computer-aided program-trading strategies . the group will complain to washington , to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the big_board itself , he said_0 . `` they should call -lcb- the exchange -rcb- trump east , '' charged mr. wohlstetter , the 79-year-old founder of contel who 's also a former investment_banker and stock trader . `` what is the mission of the financial_community -- to help some scavengers or schemers , or help corporate_america ? '' contel is a $_6 billion telephone and electronics company . pressure has_been building on the big_board in the past_two weeks to do_something about market_volatility , which many investors say_0 is caused_by program_trading . the market 's friday-the-13th plunge of 190_points in the dow_jones industrial_average , and the big_board 's understated response to it , galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies_listed on the exchange . last_month , program_trading accounted_for a record 13.8 % of average_daily big_board volume . mr. wohlstetter , for_example , said_0 he wrote to big_board chairman_john j._phelan jr. about program_trading after the 190-point dow plunge , and as in previous queries , `` what i get_back is gobbledygook . '' he said_0 he 's upset that mr._phelan , trying_to calm investors after the plunge , said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price_swings . the big_board `` is partly to blame -lcb- for the price_swings -rcb- , because_they 're cowards , '' said mr. wohlstetter . `` their powerful members manage them . '' the focus of the outcry has_been stock-index_arbitrage , which accounts for about_half the program_trading that goes on . index arbitragers argue_that their trading is healthy because it links markets , but critics_say 0 such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash . the big_board has refused_to be drawn_into a public debate about program_trading . richard grasso , big_board president , last_week said only that the exchange is concerned_about all its constituents . privately , exchange officials worry_that without a hospitable system for program_trading at the big_board , billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such_as london 's . it is partly for this reason that the exchange last_week began trading in its_own stock `` basket '' product that allows big investors to buy or sell all 500_stocks in the standard_& poor_'s index in a single trade . one intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers , according_to the exchange . investors have complained for some time about program_trading , particularly index_arbitrage , to little avail . but according_to some big_board traders , an organized campaign from exchange-listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes . `` they wo_n't fight the listed companies . now the assault is on , '' said one top trader . the big_board ca_n't ban stock-index_futures , of course , but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program_trading or at_least encourage securities_firms to back off . the exchange put a_bit of a damper on program_trading when , last_year , it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume . contel 's mr. wohlstetter said_0 the group of big_board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort , and that he does_n't plan to be the leader once it is public . however , he said_0 he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support . among those 0 mr. wohlstetter said_0 he has_been talking to are sanford weill of primerica corp. , which is the parent of smith_barney , harris_upham &_co. ; gte corp. 's james johnson , and itt_corp. 's rand araskog . none of these chief executives were available for comment . among the targets of the big_board companies_' campaign will_be some corporate pension_funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments . for contel 's part , the company a month ago informed each of its money_managers that it would drop them if_they give business to program-trading firms . it was just those kinds_of ultimatums that last_week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate . kemper corp. 's kemper_financial services unit said_0 it cut_off bear_stearns , morgan_stanley , oppenheimer and general_electric co. 's kidder , peabody_& co._unit . all of the firms except kidder , which is the second-biggest program_trader on_wall street , quickly announced pull-backs from index_arbitrage . kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program_trading . chief_executive officer michael carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of kidder 's own brokers , he_believes 0 index_arbitrage does_n't have a `` negative impact_on the market as a whole . '' however , pressure_on kidder 's parent , ge , could change kidder 's policy . ge chairman_john welch has_been `` besieged with phone_calls '' complaining_about his unit 's program_trading , according_to a person close to him .
