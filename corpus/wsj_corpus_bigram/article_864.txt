bond_prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock_market and worried_about a wave of new supply . early yesterday , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy treasury_securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive california_earthquake . for_example , some securities analysts warned_that stocks of certain insurance_companies , which face massive damage_claims , would get hit_hard . but when the dow_jones industrial_average rose instead , bonds drifted lower . with stocks not a major focus , ``_we 're waiting_for the next guiding light , '' said_0 brian j. fabbri , chief_economist at midland montagu securities_inc . `` if the stock_market tremors are behind us , then the bond_market will_go back to looking_at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest_rates are heading . the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 point , or about $ 3.75 for each $_1,000 face_amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little_changed . interest_rates barely budged from tuesday 's levels . most junk_bonds , which have_been battered in recent_weeks , continued a slow recuperation and ended_unchanged to slightly_higher . but some so-called high-quality junk issues fell as some mutual_funds sold their most liquid issues to raise_cash . rjr_holdings capital corp. 's 14.7 % bonds_due 2009 fell one_point . other rjr issues fell between 1\/2_point and 1_1\/2 point . in the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk_bonds , continental_airlines said_0 it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering . continental , a unit of texas_air corp. , slashed the size of its note offering from $_150 million to $_71 million . the move had_been widely_expected . in the multipart offering , the company sold a portion_of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured_notes . a continental spokeswoman_said 0 the notes may_be offered at a later date . `` this was not a do-or-die deal , '' she said . ``_i think_0 this is a market that required some level of security . it did_not make_sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market . '' investors have_been speculating for weeks about the market 's ability_to place the $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion of new junk_bonds scheduled to be_sold by year end . supply troubles were also on the minds of treasury investors yesterday , who worried_about the flood of new government securities coming next_week . ``_we 're being bombarded by new treasury and agency debt offerings , '' said william sullivan jr. , director of money-market research at dean_witter reynolds_inc . `` the market is concerned_about its ability_to underwrite all this debt at current_levels .

resolution_funding corp. said late_yesterday that it will sell $_4.5 billion of 30-year_bonds wednesday . refcorp is the financing unit of resolution_trust corp. , a new government agency_created to rescue the nation_'s troubled thrifts . its securities have_been dubbed `` bailout bonds '' by traders . in when-issued_trading , the two-year treasurys had a yield of about 7.88_% . in the municipal market , all eyes were on california debt as investors tried_to gauge the financial ramifications of tuesday 's earthquake . but traders_said 0 the quake had only a minor impact_on the trading of california state and local municipal debt . `` there_are certain bonds 0 traders refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the -lrb- issuers -rrb- are on top of the san_andreas fault , '' said zane mann , editor of the california municipal bond advisor , a newsletter for investors . since those bonds already pay a slightly_higher yield , an_extra premium for the earthquake risk , they_were n't materially affected . but some bond_market analysts said_0 that could quickly change if property casualty insurance_companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise_cash 0 to pay damage_claims . `` insurance_companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct san_francisco , '' said charles lieberman , chief_economist at manufacturers_hanover securities_corp . he also expects the performance of municipals to lag treasurys as california is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities . a report issued late_yesterday by standard_& poor_'s corp. concluded 0 the quake wo_n't cause `` wide-scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of northern_california affected_by the quake . treasury_securities treasury_bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet_trading . the benchmark_30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29\/32 0 to yield 8.03_% , compared_with 100 28\/32 0 to yield 8.04_% tuesday . the latest_10-year notes were_quoted late at a price of 99 26\/32 0 to yield 8_% , compared_with 99 25\/32 0 to yield 8.01 % . short-term_rates were little_changed . corporate issues investment-grade_corporate bonds_ended 1\/4_point lower . the continental junk_bond offering , underwritten_by drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , was the only new issue priced yesterday . in the four-part offering , the $_71 million of secured_equipment certificates was_priced to yield 13.75 % to 15.75 % . municipals municipal_bonds ended about 1\/8 to 3\/8 point_lower , hurt_by the circulation of two `` bid-wanted '' lists totaling_$ 655 million . chemical securities inc. is acting as agent for the seller . meanwhile , some california issues were down a touch more_than the broad market , but traders_said 0 there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake . but new_york city general_obligation bonds came under selling_pressure . traders_said 0 a steady stream of bonds was put_up for sale yesterday , pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage_point . traders_said 0 investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of the nov. 7 election . washington , d.c. , topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $_200 million of general_obligation tax revenue anticipation notes . in late trading , new_jersey

light dealings . there was no appreciable market impact from the california_earthquake . dealers_said 0 there was some concern that insurance_companies might_be forced to sell mortgage_securities to help pay earthquake-related claims , but no selling materialized . the federal_home loan_mortgage corp. and federal_national mortgage_association , two dominant issuers of mortgage_securities , have a sizable amount of california home loans in their mortgagebacked pools . but their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans 0 they purchase . and because northern_california home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large 0 to be included in freddie_mac and fannie_mae pools . meanwhile , government national_mortgage association 9_% securities for november_delivery ended at_97 29\/32 , unchanged . freddie_mac 9_% securities were at_97 4\/32 , down 1\/32 . in derivative_markets , fannie_mae issued two $_400 million

anxious day for the market . several_key economic figures_are due out and chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson is_scheduled to give the annual `` mansion house '' address to the financial_community . the chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic_policy changes . economists do_n't expect any such changes in this_year 's address , given mr._lawson 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently . meanwhile , japanese government bonds retreated in quiet_trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency . japan 's bellwether 4.6_% bond_due 1998_ended
