earnings for most of the nation_'s major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third_quarter , as companies with newer , big-selling prescription_drugs fared especially well . for the third_consecutive quarter , however , most of the companies_' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong_dollar abroad . analysts said that merck &_co. , eli_lilly &_co. , warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of bristol-myers_squibb co. all benefited_from strong_sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit_margins . less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies_' older products , many of which face stiffening competition_from generic drugs and other medicines . joseph riccardo , an_analyst with bear , stearns_& co. , said that over the past_few years most drug_makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such_as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs . as a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' mr. riccardo said_0 . analysts said_0 profit for the dozen or so big drug_makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11_% and 14_% . while that 's not spectacular , neil sweig , an_analyst with prudential bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . '' mr. sweig estimated that merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22_% , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription_drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , vasotec ; primaxin , an antibiotic , and pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication . profit_climbed even_though merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage_points '' as a result of the strong_dollar , mr. sweig said_0 . in the third_quarter of 1988 , merck earned_$ 311.8 million , or 79 cents_a share . in rahway , n.j. , a merck spokesman_said 0 the company does_n't make earnings projections . mr. sweig said_0 he estimated that lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20_% , largely_because of the performance of its new anti-depressant prozac . the drug , introduced last_year , is_expected to generate sales of about $_300 million this_year . `` it 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' mr. sweig said . in last_year 's third_quarter , lilly earned_$ 171.4 million , or $_1.20 a_share . in indianapolis , lilly declined_comment . several analysts said_0 they expected warner-lambert 's profit also to increase by more_than 20_% from $ 87.7 million , or $_1.25 a_share , 0 it reported in the like period last_year . the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent_years and shedding numerous companies with low profit_margins . the company 's lean operation , analysts said_0 , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , lopid , to power earnings_growth . lopid sales are_expected to be about $_300 million this_year , up from $ 190_million in 1988 . in morris plains , n.j. , a spokesman for the company said_0 the analysts_' projections are `` in the ballpark . '' squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18_% above the $ 123 million , or $_1.25 a_share , 0 it earned in the third_quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong_sales of its capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . the company was officially merged with bristol-myers co. earlier_this month . bristol-myers declined to comment . mr. riccardo of bear_stearns said that schering-plough corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18_% to 20_% , and bristol-meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13_% are largely_because `` those companies are really managed well . '' scheringplough earned_$ 94.4 million , or 84 cents_a share , while bristol-myers earned_$ 232.3 million , or 81 cents_a share , in the like period a year_earlier . in madison , n.j. , a spokesman for schering-plough said_0 the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter_earnings per_share rose by about 19_% , to $_1 . the company expects to achieve the 20_% increase in full-year_earnings per_share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman_said 0 . meanwhile , analysts said_0 pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5_% . sales of pfizer 's important drugs , feldene for treating arthritis , and procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased_competition . `` the -lrb- strong -rrb- dollar hurt pfizer a_lot , too , '' mr. sweig said . in the third_quarter last_year , pfizer earned_$ 216.8 million , or $_1.29 a_share . in new_york , the company declined_comment . analysts said_0 they expected upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2_% to 4_% as compared_with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents_a share , 0 it earned a year_ago . upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are xanax , a tranquilizer , and halcion , a sedative . sales of both drugs have_been hurt_by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs . also , the company 's hair-growing drug , rogaine , is selling well -- at about $_125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has_been reduced by upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said_0 . in kalamazoo , mich. , upjohn declined_comment .
