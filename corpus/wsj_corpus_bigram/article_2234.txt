west_texas intermediate , the u.s. benchmark crude , seemed tethered again yesterday in trading on the new_york mercantile_exchange . widely_expected to open 10 to 15 cents_a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the american petroleum institute , the december_contract managed to start the session only eight_cents higher . in the last hour of the trading day , december_contract took a tumble to end the session 10_cents lower at $ 19.62 a_barrel . and now that the price has_fallen below $ 19.65 , which many had said_0 showed considerable resistance , some traders and analysts figure 0 there 's little 0 to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions . with no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals 0 to dictate price moves , `` technicians are wanting to sell this stuff , '' said eric bolling of edge trading corp . `` and short-term , the technicians may_have their way . '' the market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in u.s. crude_oil stocks as the legacy of hurricane jerry . that storm hit the gulf coast oct._13 , closing the louisiana offshore oil port for a time and preventing tankers from unloading . next_week 's report could very_well show an_increase in crude inventories . dismissing the trade_group 's numbers left traders plenty_of time 0 to worry anew about the latest reports on opec production . an ap-dow jones survey of integrated oil_companies , independent refiners , and oil industry_consultants indicates_that the organization of petroleum exporting_countries increased its production to 22.2 million_barrels a day in_september . estimates suggest 0 october 's figure may_be even higher . that level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong , analysts said_0 . but the first_quarter of the year is generally the weakest and opec production does_n't seem to be slackening in_anticipation of that . also , maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies . to top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday 's trading , late october weather , especially in the northeast u.s. , continues to be very moderate , leaving heating_oil futures_trading lackluster . ``_we are n't seeing any cold weather here , '' mr. bolling said from new_york . in other_commodity markets yesterday : grains and soybeans_: soybean and corn_futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying_to profit from technical price_trends , as_well as continued export strength . a leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure_on futures_contract prices . wheat futures_prices fell , however , at_least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures_contracts equal to several million_bushels of wheat by commodity speculator richard dennis . neither mr. dennis nor officials of his chicago trading company , c&d commodities , could_be reached for comment . as for corn and soybean futures , `` a_lot of commission house buying this_morning and computer-driven buying '' supported prices in early_trading , said_0 steven freed , a futures analyst_with dean_witter reynolds_inc. in chicago . soybean futures for november_delivery gained 5.25 cents_a bushel to close_at $ 5.66 a_bushel on the chicago_board of trade . december corn_futures added 2.25 cents_a bushel to close_at $ 2.4225 a_bushel on the board of trade . announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures_prices . `` russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there_is n't enough grain in the pipeline , '' said katharina zimmer , a futures analyst_with merrill_lynch &_co. in new_york . the soviet_union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this_month , and is_expected to take delivery by year end , analysts said_0 . cotton : futures_prices rose_modestly , but trading_volume was n't very heavy . the december_contract settled_at 73.97 cents_a pound , up 0.59 cent , but it rose as high as 74.20 cents . several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical . traders who had sold contracts earlier , in hopes of buying them back at lower_prices , yesterday were buying contracts back at higher_prices to limit their losses . floor_traders also said that the market could have_been helped by rumors , which have_been circulating for the past_two days , about china purchasing cotton . the rumor , which has_been neither confirmed nor denied , has china buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near-term delivery . one floor trader said that if there_were chinese purchases , they should have had a bigger effect_on the market . another said that if china was a buyer , it would_be the earliest 0 that country had made purchases since the 1979-80 crop year , and thus would_be a bullish sign . this trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists , who see higher_prices ahead , and the technicians , who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range , around 71_cents , and selling it when the price climbs more_than 74_cents . this trader said that he thought_0 the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the december_contract was able_to exceed 75.75 cents . he also_noted that stocks on aug._1 , 1990 , are currently projected at 3.3_million bales , the smallest end-of-season supply since_1985 . cocoa : the modest sell-off , which started on tuesday , continued . the december_contract ended at $ 999 a metric_ton , down $ 15 . the market is drifting , at_least partly , because of a lack_of crop information out of ghana and the ivory_coast , the two largest african producers . harry schwartz , a soft commodity specialist for cargill investors services in new_york , said_0 the only report 0 ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric_tons as of oct._12 . by this time last_year , he_noted 0 , arrivals totaling 33,270 tons had_been announced . a similar situation apparently exists in the ivory_coast with no figures released yet this_year , compared_with 55,000 tons as of this time a year_ago . he said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports , shipping delays could result . this is the worry_that probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week , he said_0 . there was also some fear that without ivory_coast cocoa a large french cocoa merchant , cie . financiere sucre et denrees , might_not be_able to deliver cocoa against the contracts 0 it had sold earlier for december_delivery in london . however , the french merchant has about 200,000_tons of old crop ivory_coast cocoa stored in the netherlands from an_agreement 0 it had negotiated with the ivory_coast last_spring . cargill thinks that even_though the merchant has a contract stating that it wo_n't bring this cocoa to market until after march 1991 , there_is some evidence 0 the contract has_been modified . this modification , apparently , would_permit the french merchant to deliver this cocoa , if_necessary , against existing short_positions .
