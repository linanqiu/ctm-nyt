after several_years of booming business with china , foreign traders are_bracing for the biggest slump in a decade . the imposition of austerity measures , starting last october , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in tiananmen square on june_4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter . foreign lending has_been virtually suspended since_then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects . and beijing has pulled_back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash . givaudan far_east ltd. , a swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in china , typifies the problems . last_year 's retrenchment dried up the working_capital of chinese factories . the company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first_half . the june killings magnified the problems . in canton , givaudan 's representative office received no orders in june . at first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in_august and september , manager donald lai became convinced that business would_be bad for many months . `` things have_grown worse since_june 4 , '' mr. lai says . he predicts that sales will drop between 30_% and 40_% from last_year 's $_3 million . the consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of china_'s austerity measures , and foreign companies such_as givaudan that deal_with those industries are_being hit the hardest . but in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch . `` the import pie will shrink , ''_says john kamm , first vice_president of the american chamber of commerce in hong_kong and a china trade specialist . `` on the down side , sales could fall as_much as 90_% for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will_be flat . '' china_'s foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past_decade . the last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when beijing imposed tough measures 0 to curb imports and conserve foreign_exchange . the current trough is_expected to be much deeper , because beijing has cut_off domestic funds from factories for the first_time to slow inflation . in_addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june killings have_been a big setback . `` the freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , ''_says raymond wong , china manager for mannesmann ag , a west_german machinery-trading company . import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16_% in july and 7.1 % in_august , compared_with an_average growth_rate of 26_% in the first_half . in the first_eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21_% , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth_rate of 23_% a year_earlier . the picture for china_'s exports is just as bleak , mainly_because of the domestic credit squeeze . exports in the first_eight months grew only 9_% , to $ 31.48 billion , compared_with a growth_rate of 25_% a year_earlier , according_to chinese customs figures . the threat to china_'s balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings . the reserves dropped for the first_time in recent_years , to $ 14 billion in june from $ 19 billion in april . the trend has prompted beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports . in recent_weeks , china_'s leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities . the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set_up a special bureau last_month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses . beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best_way 0 to get through the drought is by helping china export . for_example , nissho iwai corp. , one of the biggest japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice_as many goods from china as it sells to that country . three_years ago , the ratio was reversed . but the strategy is n't helping much this time . `` both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , ''_says masahiko kitamura , general_manager of nissho iwai 's canton office . he_expects the company 's trading business to drop as_much as 40_% this_year . for a short time after june_4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright . many foreign trading offices in hong_kong were swamped with telexes and telephone_calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties . even the bank of china , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health . but when foreign traders tried_to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen . the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china_'s national trading companies , which are among the country 's_biggest importers . business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders_say 0 . shanghai investment &_trust co. , known_as sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business . sitco had customarily tapped the japanese bond_market for funds , but it ca_n't do that any longer . foreign traders_say 0 the company is strapped for cash . `` it has difficulties paying its foreign debts , ''_says a hong_kong executive who is familiar_with sitco 's business . `` how can it make available funds for purchases ? '' foreign traders also say_0 many of china_'s big infrastructural projects have_been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit . albert lee , a veteran trader who_specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70_% of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have_been canceled in recent_months . `` there_are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he_says 0 . even when new lending resumes , foreign_exchange would still be tight because beijing will likely try_to rein in foreign borrowing , which has_grown between 30_% and 40_% in the past_few years . and foreign creditors are_likely to be more cautious_about extending new loans because china is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five_years . another_reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer_products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics . these have_been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last_year when there_were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly . but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices . to stem speculation , beijing imposed ceiling prices that went_into effect earlier_this year . traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do_n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock . the resulting stockpiling has depressed the market . but beijing ca_n't cut_back on such essential imports as raw_materials for too_long without hampering the country 's export business . mr. kamm , the china trade expert , estimates that as_much as 50_% of guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw_materials .
