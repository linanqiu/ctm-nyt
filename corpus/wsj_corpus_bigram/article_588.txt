the panhandler approaches , makes his pitch . it may_be straightforward -- he_wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $_1.22 in change 0 to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo_n't you give him the difference ? no ? well , how about a loan , he 'll_take your name and address ... figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of night train express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this . but healthy skepticism vanishes when they_are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you . most see little reason 0 to doubt that their cash will_go toward these noble goals . but will it ? in a distressing number_of cases , no . in fact , the donors sometimes might_be better_off giving the money to the panhandler : at_least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth . last_year , more_than $_100 billion was donated to the nation_'s 400,000 charities . while the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works 0 it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses . in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries . it 's impossible to say exactly how_much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud . but the problem clearly is widespread and persistent . state law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such_as the council of better business bureaus are not encouraging . the philanthropic advisory service of the bbb reviews hundreds_of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going_to work for which the charity was supposedly established . the service figures 0 at_least half of the money taken in should_be spent on program . roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test . which , it should_be added , does_n't prevent the charities from raking in a_lot of money anyway . without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all 0 you_'ve got 0 to go on is the solicitation itself . on this basis , `` there 's no_way 0 the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , ''_says 0 david ormstedt , an assistant attorney_general in connecticut . `` a_lot of donors just get taken . '' including those , he_contends , who put about $_1 million into the kitty for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center . the state has sued these charities in state_court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says mr. ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people_who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to florida , lucullan restaurant tabs . the telephone number for the charity in shelton , conn. , has_been disconnected , and the former officials could_n't be located . running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they_are really needed . the arthritis foundation , the american cancer society and the united way of america all say that they spend roughly 90_% of their income on programs , not overhead . with some other charities , however , it s the other way around . the fledgling national children 's cancer society , for_example , took in $_2.5 million last_year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children . by the time 0 it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child . the state of illinois is suing the charity for fraud in chicago , along_with telesystems marketing inc. , its houston-based fund raiser . both deny wrongdoing . the charity admits spending a_lot on fund_raising , but says_0 that was necessary to establish a donor base 0 it can tap at much lower cost in years 0 to come . michael burns , president of telesystems , says_0 his concern has only benefited_from the publicity surrounding the case , noting_that three other charities have signed on as clients because_they were impressed with the amount 0 he raised for national children 's . meanwhile , a state_court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . enforcers ca_n't put charities out of business simply because_they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund_raising . state laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather_than overhead , but these have_been overturned by the u.s. supreme_court . it has ruled_that such laws might work to stifle fund_raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . this puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have_been brought_against hundreds_of charities recently . the attorney_general 's office in connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past_couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . in making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . illinois , for_instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an_additional inducement to give . attorneys general in several states , including illinois , are already suing watson & hughey co. , an alexandria , va.-based outfit that they say_0 has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the american heart disease foundation and the cancer fund of america . according_to the illinois attorney_general 's suit , watson & hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an_additional $_1,000 on top of them , if_they contributed as little as $ 7 . but the total_value of the prizes was only $_5,000 and most `` winners '' will_receive just 10_cents , according_to the attorney_general 's office . the suit is still pending in illinois state_court . watson & hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further . while they_can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede_that they_are only scratching the surface . there_are so_many cunning ploys used by so_many dubious operators , they say_0 , that it is probably impossible to stop them all . one maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit . the solicitation material indicates_that donations will_go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue . what it_does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may_be the fund-raising letter itself . `` all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such_as , ` do_n't smoke ! ' or ` wear suntan lotion , ' `` says william webster , attorney_general of missouri . `` by putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds_of thousands_of dollars are claimed to have_been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . '' mr. webster cites a four-page mailing from the united cancer council that offers a chance to win $_5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $_5 to cancer education . `` a few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages . i_think 0 some people may believe_0 they_'re helping fund a massive tv and print campaign , but we could_n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he_says . officials at the washington d.c.-based charity did_n't return repeated phone_calls . many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs . the established charities are bothered by this but say_0 they_can do little about it . ``_we ca_n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few_years using part_of our name . most of them do_n't last for long , but in the meantime all 0 we_can do is tell people 0 they_are n't connected with us , ''_says a spokeswoman for the american heart association . and sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does_n't even know it . a couple in rockford , ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier_this year using the name and logo of mothers against drunk driving , without permission from the group . madd did_n't learn of the fund_raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along_with a letter saying_0 that was the charity 's `` share . '' the illinois attorney_general won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without madd 's permission . the couple could_n't be_reached for comment and apparently have left rockford , law_enforcement officials report 0 . denise mcdonald , a spokeswoman for madd , says , `` it 's scary , because anybody could do this .
