as the hunt brothers_' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year , minpeco s.a. has proposed a deal 0 to_settle its huge claim against the troubled texas oil men . but the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in_september 1988 . the peruvian mineral concern 's $ 251 million claim stems_from 1988 jury award in a case stemming_from the brothers_' alleged attempts_to corner the 1979-80 silver market . minpeco now says_0 it is willing_to settle for up to $ 65.7 million from each brother , although the actual amount would probably be much_less . although the proposal must_be approved_by federal_judge harold c. abramson , w. herbert_hunt has_agreed to the peruvian mineral concern 's proposal . nelson bunker hunt is_considering it , although his attorney says_0 he wo_n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement 0 he has reached with the internal_revenue service , which claims 0 the brothers owe $_1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases . the tentative_agreement between the irs and nelson bunker hunt is awaiting u.s. justice_department approval . under it , the former billionaire 's assets would_be liquidated with the irs getting 80_% of the proceeds and the rest being divided among_other creditors , including minpeco and manufacturers_hanover trust_co. , which is_seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan . a similiar proposal has_been made in the w. herbert_hunt case although he and the irs are at_odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt 0 he would_have to pay to the government from future earnings . in both cases , minpeco and manufacturers_hanover have_been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie . with support from the irs , manufacturers_hanover has filed_suit asking judge abramson to subordinate minpeco 's claim to those of manufacturer hanover and the irs . minpeco has threatened a `` volcano '' of litigation if the manufacturers_hanover corp. unit attempts_to force such a plan through the court . minpeco said_0 it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the w. herbert_hunt case is approved_by judge abramson , who will consider the proposal at a hearing next_week . minpeco attorney thomas gorman decribed the plan as one step_toward an overall settlement of the w. herbert_hunt case but hugh ray , attorney for manufacturers_hanover , called it `` silly '' and said_0 he would fight it in court . `` the thing is so fluid right_now that there 's really no_way 0 to say what will happen , ''_says justice_department attorney grover hartt iii , who_represents the irs in the case . `` developments like this are hard 0 to predict .
