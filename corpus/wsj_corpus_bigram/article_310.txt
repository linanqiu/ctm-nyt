at a private dinner thursday , drexel_burnham lambert_inc. chief_executive frederick joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk_bond market to officials of prudential_insurance co. of america . mr. joseph conceded 0 the junk_market was in disarray , according_to people_familiar with the discussion . he said_0 drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk_junk bonds -- could no_longer afford to sell any junk offerings if_they might later become troubled because drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise . the dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $_200 billion junk_market . and investors and traders alike say_0 the current turmoil could take years to resolve . amid the market disorder , even drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk_bond investors , is pulling in its horns . although the big investment_bank still dominates the junk_market , drexel has_been unable_to stem the fallout from growing junk_bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk_bond mutual_funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . for many money_managers , the past_four months have_been humiliating . `` this is the worst shakeout ever in the junk_market , and it could take years before it 's over , ''_says mark bachmann , a senior_vice president at standard_& poor_'s corp. , a credit rating company . in the third_quarter , for_example , junk_bonds -- those with less_than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond_market 0 to do_so . since the end of last_year , junk_bonds have_been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade_bonds , including ultra-safe treasury_securities . the junk_market , which mushroomed to $_200 billion from less_than $_2 billion at the start of the decade , has_been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest_payments . the fragile market received its biggest jolt last_month from campeau_corp. , which created its u.s._retailing empire with more_than $_3 billion in junk financing . campeau developed a cash_squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest_payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdale_'s department_store chain up for sale . at that point , the junk_market went_into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried_to sell . in an_interview , mr. joseph says_0 his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk . `` what i_thought 0 i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he_says . `` nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past_couple years , and we_'re going_to make_sure 0 our default_rates are going_to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . '' what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk_bonds can_not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade_bonds . unlike the new_york stock_exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk_market , where risky corporate_loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs . at closely_held deltec securities corp. , junk_bond money_managers amy k. minella and hannah h. strasser say_0 the problems of the junk_market go deeper than a temporary malaise . in recent_months , they say_0 , there has_been heavy selling of junk_bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them . wall_street securities_firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have_been net sellers of junk_bonds because of trading losses , deltec said_0 in a recent , grim report to customers . mutual_funds have also been net sellers of junk_bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , deltec said_0 . investors , trying_to raise_cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such_as rjr_holdings corp. and kroger co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed_to the market 's distress . and , deltec said_0 , buying has_been severely reduced because savings and loans have_been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional_legislation . `` in fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' deltec said . ms. minella and ms. strasser say_0 they_are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality . meanwhile , prudential , the nation_'s largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk_bonds , has seen the value of its junk_bond portfolio drop to $ 6.5_billion from $ 7 billion since august because of falling junk prices . ``_we certainly do have a lack_of liquidity here , and it 's something 0 to be concerned_about , ''_says james_a. gregoire , a managing_director . ``_i have no_reason 0 to think_0 things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us . this market teaches us to be humble . '' the junk_market 's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson , '' he_says 0 . although the majority of junk_bonds outstanding show no_signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if_they were in trouble , says_0 stuart reese , manager of aetna_life &_casualty insurance_co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio . `` but we_think 0 the risks are there for things getting a_lot worse . and the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he_says . the big insurer , unlike prudential , owns only about $_150 million of publicly sold junk_bonds . the string of big junk_bond defaults , which have_been a major cause of the market 's problems this_year , probably will persist , some_analysts say_0 . `` if anything , we_'re going_to see defaults increase because credit_ratings have declined , ''_says paul asquith , associate professor_at the massachusetts_institute of technology 's sloan school of management . mr. asquith , whose study on junk_bond defaults caused a furor on_wall street when it was disclosed last_april , says_0 this_year 's junk_bond defaults already show a high correlation with his_own findings . his study showed that junk_bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34_% . one indication of a growing_number of junk defaults , mr. asquith says_0 , is that about_half of the $_3 billion of corporate_bonds outstanding that have_been lowered to a default rating by s&p this_year are junk_bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 . these bonds , now rated single-d , include junk offerings by ap industries , columbia_savings -lrb- colorado -rrb- , first texas savings_association , gilbraltar financial_corp. , integrated_resources inc. , metropolitan broadcasting_corp. , resorts international_inc. , southmark corp. and vyquest inc . ``_obviously , we got a_lot more smoke than fire from the people_who told us 0 the market was n't so risky , ''_says bradford cornell , professor of finance at university of california 's anderson graduate_school of management in los_angeles . mr. cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk_bonds are less_than on common stocks but more_than on investment-grade_bonds . mr. cornell says : `` the junk_market is no bonanza as drexel claimed 0 , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say_0 . '' despite the junk_market 's problems , drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk_bond investors that its wall_street rivals have n't found . during the past_three weeks , for_example , drexel has sold $_1.3 billion of new junk_bonds for turner_broadcasting co. , uniroyal_chemical , continental air and duff_& phelps . still , the list of troubled drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on_wall street , as does its successful offerings . troubled drexel-underwritten issues include resorts international , braniff , integrated_resources , sci_tv , gillette holdings , western electric and southmark . `` quality junk_bonds will_continue to trade well , ''_says michael holland , chairman of salomon_brothers asset_management inc . `` but the deals that never should have_been brought have now become nuclear waste .
