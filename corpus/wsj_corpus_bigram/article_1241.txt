the sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered friday_'s explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout . the setback , in which treasury_bond prices_plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock_market and profit-taking . `` it was a pretty wild day . our markets were closely tied to the stock_market , '' said joel kazis , manager of trading at smith_barney , harris_upham &_co . `` friday_'s flight to quality was no_longer needed once the stock_market found its legs , '' he said . some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock_prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average on friday . that caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality treasury_bonds , which are safer than other types_of securities . but when stocks began to climb instead , prices of treasury_bonds declined . contributing to the selling_pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . among the firms were merrill_lynch &_co. and dean_witter reynolds_inc . the bond_market seemed to ignore evidence that the federal_reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal_funds rate to drift as low as 8_1\/2 % . the closely_watched rate on federal_funds , or overnight_loans between banks , slid to about 8_3\/4 % last_week , down from its perceived target level of about 9_% . the rate is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy . traders_said 0 yesterday 's modest easing did_n't stir much enthusiasm because it had_been widely_expected . in fact , some_economists contend_that the latest easing started last_week . others note that some investors were disappointed because_they had expected a more_aggressive easing . the treasury 's benchmark_30-year bond , ended about 1_3\/4 points_lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $_1,000 face_amount . the reversal was even more evident among shorter-term treasury_securities . after treasury bill rates plummeted as_much as 0.70 percentage_point on friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday . the bond-equivalent_yield on three-month_treasury bills , for_example , was_quoted late_yesterday at 7.72 % , compared_with 7.16 % friday . investment-grade_corporate bonds , mortgage-backed_securities and municipal_bonds also fell . but prices of junk_bonds , which were battered friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading_session . junk_bonds opened as_much as four points_lower but staged a modest comeback as stock_prices firmed . some traders_said 0 the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying . in particular , they said_0 , firms such_as first_boston corp. and drexel_burnham lambert_inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . ``_i think_0 the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk_bonds , '' said john lonski , an_economist at moody_'s investors_service inc . u.s. treasury_bonds were higher in overnight trading in japan , which opened at about 7:30 p.m._edt . the benchmark_30-year bond , for_example rose one_point in early japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the tokyo_stock market . but as japanese stocks rebounded , treasurys retreated and ended just modestly_higher . many u.s. trading operations , wanting to_keep a watchful eye on japanese trading as an_indication of where u.s. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the tokyo trading_session . `` most of the action was during the night session , '' said michael moore , trading manager at continental_bank . jay goldinger , who often trades overnight for capital insight inc. , beverly_hills , calif. , said_0 trading in tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile . ``_we went_down 3\/4 point in 10_minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went_up 3\/4 point in 12 minutes , '' he said . in tokyo , trading is halted during lunchtime . tokyo 's market turned_out to be a bad bellwether for u.s. trading . when the market opened here , bonds prices_fell as the stock_market regained strength . the bond_market 's focus_on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic_data , which_includes the government 's report on august u.s. merchandise_trade and september industrial_production . industrial_production is_expected to have declined 0.2_% , according_to a consensus of economists surveyed by dow_jones capital_markets report . the august trade_deficit is_expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in july . a widening of that magnitude , said_0 one new_york trader , is `` not a favorable number ... . it could do damage to us . '' meanwhile , agency supply is_expected to weigh heavily_on the market today when the federal_home loan bank prices a $_2.3 billion offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and 10-year maturities . tomorrow , the resolution_funding corp. will provide details of its first bond_issue , which is_expected to total between $_4 billion and $_6 billion and carry a maturity greater_than 20_years . resolution_funding is a division of resolution_trust corp. , the new federal_agency created to bail_out the nation_'s troubled thrifts . and this_week the tennessee_valley authority plans to price a $_3 billion offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15_years . `` there 's lots of supply , '' the new_york trader said . ``_we have a couple or three tough weeks coming .
