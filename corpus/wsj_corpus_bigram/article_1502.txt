as a money_manager and a grass-roots environmentalist , i was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of garbage that the wall_street journal uses 220,000 metric_tons of newsprint each year , but that only 1.4 % of it comes from recycled paper . by_contrast , the los_angeles times , for_example , uses 83 % recycled paper . with newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills , and with our country overflowing with trash , all sectors of our_society and all types_of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural_resources . the wall_street journal is an excellent publication that i enjoy reading -lrb- and must read -rrb- daily . please make me and thousands_of other readers more comfortable_with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels , and increase your use of recycled paper . virginia m.w. gardiner
