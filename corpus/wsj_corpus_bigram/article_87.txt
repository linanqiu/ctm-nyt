if bluebloods wo_n't pay high prices for racehorses anymore , who will ? breeders are betting on the common folk . the thoroughbred owners and breeders association , a lexington , ky.-based trade_group , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential investors '' at race tracks around the country . the group , which has held half a dozen seminars so_far , also is_considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to wall_street investment_bankers . `` people in this business have_been insulated , ''_says josh pons , a horse breeder from bel air , md . `` but the real future of this game is in a number_of people owning a few horses . '' at the laurel race track , the breeders are romancing people like tim hulings , a beer packaging plant worker . right_now , mr. hulings is waving his racing program , cheering for karnak on the nile , a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch . mr. hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190_points on_oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm . `` just imagine how exciting that would_be if that 's your horse , '' he_says . but experts caution that this is n't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet . `` it 's a big-risk business , '' warns charles c. mihalek , a lexington attorney and former kentucky state securities commissioner . `` you have to go_into it firmly believing that it 's the kind_of investment where you_can lose everything . '' and many have done just that . consider spendthrift farm , a prominent lexington horse farm that went_public in_1983 but hit_hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last_year . a group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of spendthrift , hoping to rebuild it . other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights . one big problem has_been the thoroughbred racehorse market . from 1974 to 1984 , prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales_rose 918 % to an_average of $ 544,681 . since_then , prices have slumped , to an_average of $ 395,374 this_summer . but that 's for the best horses , with most selling for much_less -- as little as $_100 for some pedestrian thoroughbreds . even while they move outside their traditional tony circle , racehorse owners still try_to capitalize_on the elan of the sport . glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner 's circle and high-society schmoozing . one handout promises : `` pedigrees , parties , post times , parimutuels and pageantry . '' `` it 's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves , ''_says headley bell , a fifth-generation horse breeder from lexington . maybe it 's not that simple . for starters , racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures : these beasts do_n't come with warranties . and for every champion , there_are plenty_of nags . katherine voss , a veteran trainer at the laurel , md. , track , offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn , noting_that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses . one brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold , while another had splints on its legs , keeping both animals from the racetrack . `` you_can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof , '' she tells the group . `` there_are n't too_many winners . '' perhaps the biggest hurdle 0 owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business . some badly managed partnerships have burned investors , sometimes after they received advice from industry `` consultants . '' so owners have developed a `` code of ethics , '' outlining rules for consultants and agents , and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest . but some are_skeptical of the code 's effectiveness . `` the industry is based_on individual honesty , ''_says cap hershey , a lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought spendthrift . despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds , owning one still is n't cheap . at the low end , investors can spend $_15,000 or more to own a racehorse in partnership with others . at a yearling sale , a buyer can_go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars . but that means paying the horse 's maintenance ; on average , it costs $_25,000 a year to raise a horse . for those looking_for something between a minority_stake and total ownership , the owners ' group is_considering a special sale where established horse breeders would sell a 50_% stake_in horses to newcomers .
