` frequent drinker ' offer stirs up spirited debate to grab a bigger piece of the declining scotch market , seagram co. has launched a controversial `` frequent drinker '' promotion for its chivas regal brand . under the program , dubbed chivas class , customers who send in two labels from chivas bottles will_receive an upgrade in seating class on some trans_world airlines flights . repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices . but at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor marketers consider seagram 's frequent buyer promotion risky . ``_i 'm surprised 0 they_'re doing this , ''_says penn kavanagh , president of schieffelin & somerset co. , which markets johnnie walker scotches . ``_i would_be very leery of anything that says if_you drink more , you_get more . '' others question the impact_on chivas 's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels . `` it 's really bizarre , ''_says albert lerman , creative director at the wells_rich greene ad_agency . `` chivas has an image of something 0 you would savor , rather_than guzzle . '' chivas class is n't the first such promotion . last_year , j&b scotch offered 500 twa frequent flier miles in exchange for a label . and dewar 's gave discounts on scottish merchandise to people_who sent in bottle labels . but the scope of seagram 's chivas promotion sets it apart . the current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three-to-five-year direct_marketing plan . seagram says_0 the promotion is designed to build brand_loyalty rather_than promote heavy drinking . seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period , says_0 richard shaw , vice_president of u.s. direct_marketing . ``_we 're_not asking them to save up 50 proof-of-purchases . we_'re not saying drink more , we_'re saying trade up . '' goya concocts a milk for hispanic tastes most food companies these_days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health-conscious consumers . but goya foods inc. believes_0 it can milk some sales by bucking the trend . the secaucus , n.j. , company has formed a joint_venture with a distributor called la lecheria to market a higher-fat milk targeted at hispanic consumers . to give leche fresca the creamier taste 0 goya says_0 hispanics prefer , the new brand has a butterfat content of 3.8_% . that compares_with 3.5_% butterfat for whole milk . a spokesman for borden inc. , the nation_'s largest milk producer , concedes 0 goya may_be on to something . borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced-fat milks in southern and hispanic markets , he_says 0 . borden even tested a milk with 4_% butterfat in the south , but decided 0 the market was too small . goya is selling leche fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in new_york and parts of new_jersey . and it 's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day , says_0 greg ricca , sales director at la lecheria . because of leche fresca 's success , he_says 0 , the joint_venture is developing other dairy products tailored to hispanic tastes . jewelry makers copy cosmetics sales ploys for years , costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle . jewelry displays in department_stores were often cluttered and uninspired . and the merchandise was , well , fake . as a result , marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department_stores to more fashionable rivals -- cosmetics makers . but lately , retailers say_0 , fake has_become more fashionable . and jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics . last_year , the total women 's fashion jewelry business topped $_4.9 billion , says_0 karen alberg , editor of accessories magazine . and it 's growing fast , with annual_sales gains of more_than 10_% . to increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such_as crystal brands_inc.
