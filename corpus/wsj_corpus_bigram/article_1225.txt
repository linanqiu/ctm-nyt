a bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between nomura_securities co. and industrial bank of japan , two of the world 's most_powerful financial companies . the clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in japan 's once-cozy financial circles . not_only are japan 's financial_institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they_'re squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion . already , the consequences are_being felt by other players in the financial_markets -- even governments . what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a new_zealand government bond_issue . nomura was attempting_to organize the 50 billion-yen -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese_banks , led_by industrial bank of japan , were pressuring the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment_bank that had_been owned_by new_zealand 's civil-service pension_fund . unwilling to put_up new money for new_zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed nomura to postpone it this_week . the dispute shows clearly the global power of japan 's financial titans . aside_from nomura 's injured pride , the biggest victim so_far has_been the new_zealand government . barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , wellington 's debt management office had_been casting abroad to raise the 3_billion new_zealand dollars_-lrb- us$ 1.76 billion -rrb- to nz$ 4_billion 0 it needs to come_up with by the end of its fiscal_year next june_30 . with japan 's cash-flush banks aligned against it , though , raising money may_be difficult . not_only can they block wellington from raising money in japan , bankers here say_0 , but as the largest underwriters in the eurobond market , they might_be able_to scuttle borrowings there , too . new_zealand 's finance_minister , david caygill , lashed out at such suggestions . he told_reporters in wellington tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to dfc new_zealand ltd. , an investment_bank 80%-owned by the national provident fund , and would n't bail it out . `` it may very_well be what the japanese_banks want , '' he told radio new_zealand . ``_i think_0 it would_be irresponsible and i_am not about to be blackmailed by japanese_banks or any other international interests . '' no less significant than the japanese_banks ' attempt_to cut_off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries . anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each_other . both_sides are jealously guarding their turf , and relations have_been at a flashpoint for months . the banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business . meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller_than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds_of banking that would n't open them to the full brunt of competition_from the banks . nomura , the world 's_biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field , and industrial bank of japan , japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital_markets abroad , captain the opposing sides . and their suspicions of each_other run deep . in the past year , both have tried_to stretch the limits of their businesses . nomura started a credit-card venture with american_express co. that allowed cardholders to use their nomura_securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the wrath of banks . and industrial bank of japan started up a london securities subsidiary that sells japanese stocks to non-japanese institutions overseas , a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage_firms . the new_zealand bond_issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face .
