frank lloyd wright is reported to have said once that if_you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end_up in california . we_'ve always thought that mr. wright underestimated california 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . what else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental_groups and organized by the state 's attorney_general ? if passed by the voters , the recently_announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon_dioxide emissions by 40_% , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone_layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $_40 million budget 0 to sue any firm or agency 0 he_thinks 0 is being too dirty . the initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the sierra club , the league of conservation voters , the natural_resources defense_council , the national toxics campaign and the citizens for a better environment . interestingly , the environmental defense fund is having nothing 0 to do with this one . not_only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed . the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do_n't meet the initiative 's standards . kansas wheat farmers and florida fruit growers would_have to adjust or give up the california market . in other_words , california is presuming to take control of the nation_'s farm policy . as_usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . consider the greenhouse-effect provision . the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon_dioxide of 40_% . even_if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact_on what is billed as a global problem . but if rational science and economics have nothing 0 to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ? the first place 0 to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit . the key here is the ambition of state_attorney general john van de kamp . he 's running for governor . mr. van de kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental_groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative 0 to be placed on the ballot for election on nov._6 , 1990 . that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election . the initiative seems to have_been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood weepers who donate money . and it allows mr. van de kamp to get around campaign spending limits . he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the van de kamp initiative -lrb- on which there_are no limits -rrb- is gravy . this initiative is being labeled the big green , but maybe it should_be called the big greenback . -lrb- the republican candidate , sen. pete wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his_own crime initiative . -rrb- while it is possible that the big green initiative will_be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern california it could slide through . this is the state that recently passed the prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative . if this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly . the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer 0 to sue companies or government_agencies that do things 0 he does_n't like . that means 0 the nrdc and such groups no_longer would_have to spend as_much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost . mr. van de kamp and his allies may_be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric . of course the state 's liberals are not_yet a nation unto themselves . george_bush , for_example , may decide that he does_n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an_attorney general from california . and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point_out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs . this grandiose initiative will_help california define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it .
