nicaraguan president daniel ortega may_have accomplished over the weekend what his u.s. antagonists have failed to do : revive a constituency for the contra_rebels . lawmakers have n't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military_aid to the contras , and president_bush parried the question at a news_conference here saturday , saying only that `` if there 's an all-out military offensive , that 's going_to change the equation 180 degrees . '' but mr._ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him , effectively elevated the contras as a policy priority just as they_were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters . senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- said yesterday on nbc-tv 's `` meet the press '' that mr._ortega 's threat was `` a very unwise move , particularly the timing of it . '' the threat came during a two-day celebration in costa_rica 0 to highlight central_america 's progress toward democracy in the region , attended by president_bush , canadian prime_minister brian mulroney and 14 other western hemisphere leaders . mr._bush returned to washington saturday_night . mr._ortega announced on friday that he would end the cease-fire this_week in response to the periodic contra assaults against his army . saturday , he amended his remarks to say that he would_continue to abide by the cease-fire if the u.s. ends its financial support for the contras . he asked that the remaining u.s. humanitarian_aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels . not_only did mr._ortega 's comments come in the midst_of what was intended as a showcase for the region , it came as nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in_anticipation of its planned february elections . outside observers are gathering in nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates . and important u.s. lawmakers must decide at the end of november if the contras are to receive the rest of the $ 49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the bush_administration in march . the humanitarian assistance , which pays for supplies such_as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the nicaraguan border with honduras , replaced the military_aid cut_off by congress in february_1988 . while few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian_aid would_be cut_off next_month , mr._ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian_aid will_be continued . senate minority leader robert_dole -lrb-_r. , kan . -rrb- said yesterday on `` meet the press '' : ``_i would hope 0 after his -lcb- mr._ortega 's -rcb- act yesterday or the day before , we_'d have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian_aid . '' sen. dole also said_0 he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution 0 he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the nicaraguan leader . while renewing military_aid had_been considered out of the question , rejected by congress and de-emphasized by the bush_administration , mr._ortega 's statement provides contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue . `` the administration should now state that if the -lcb- february -rcb- election is voided by the sandinistas ... they should call for military_aid , '' said former assistant_secretary of state elliott abrams . `` in these circumstances , i_think 0 they_'d win . '' sen._mitchell said that congressional democrats intend_to honor the march agreement to give non-lethal support to the contras through the february elections , although he_added that the agreement requires that the contras not initiate any military action . mr._ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as u.s. officials were acknowledging that the contras have at times violated it themselves . secretary of state james_baker , who accompanied president_bush to costa_rica , told_reporters friday : ``_i have no_reason 0 to deny reports that some contras ambushed some sandinista soldiers . '' mr._baker 's assistant for inter-american affairs , bernard aronson , while maintaining that the sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire , acknowledged : `` it 's never very_clear who starts what . '' he_added that the u.s. has cut_off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire . in_addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending contra aid , mr._ortega 's remarks also played to the suspicions of some u.s. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching_for ways_0 to manipulate or void the february elections . administration_officials traveling with president_bush in costa_rica interpreted mr._ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so_much as he is searching_for ways_0 to strengthen his hand prior to the elections . mr. abrams said that mr._ortega is_seeking to demobilize the contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections . `` my sense is 0 what they have in mind is an_excuse for clamping down on campaigning '' by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency , he said_0 .
