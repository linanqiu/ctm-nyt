influential members of the house_ways and means_committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan_bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick_thrifts . the bill , whose backers include chairman dan rostenkowski -lrb-_d. , ill. -rrb- , would prevent the resolution_trust corp. from raising temporary working_capital by having an rtc-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be_counted on the federal_budget . the bill intends_to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . `` such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far_more expensive than direct treasury borrowing , '' said rep. fortney stark -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- , the bill 's chief sponsor . the complex financing plan in the s&l_bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly_created rtc . this financing system was created in the new law in order to_keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget_deficit . another $ 20 billion would_be raised through treasury_bonds , which pay lower_interest rates . but the rtc also requires `` working '' capital 0 to maintain the bad_assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can_be sold separately . that debt would_be paid_off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10_years . `` it 's a problem that clearly has to be_resolved , '' said david cooke , executive_director of the rtc . the agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent s&ls , and it is_likely to sell or merge 600 by the time 0 the bailout concludes . absent other working_capital , he said_0 , the rtc would_be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could_be raised by selling the bad_assets . ``_we would_have to wait_until we have collected on those assets before we_can move forward , '' he said . the complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight . the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $_5 billion at any time . moreover , it says_0 the rtc 's total obligations may_not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market_value of the assets 0 the rtc holds . but congress did_n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say_0 opponents of the rtc 's working-capital plan , and rep. charles schumer -lrb-_d. , n.y . -rrb- said_0 the rtc oversight board has_been remiss in not keeping congress informed . `` that secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said . `` the rtc is going_to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the hill if_they want that kind_of flexibility . '' the ways and means_committee will hold a hearing on the bill next_tuesday .
