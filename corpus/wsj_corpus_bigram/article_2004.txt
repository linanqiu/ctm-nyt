a potentially safer whooping_cough vaccine made by novel genetic_engineering techniques was described by a team of italian , u.s. and japanese scientists . the team reported 0 they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced_by the bacterium that causes whooping_cough . laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping_cough , the researchers reported 0 in this_week 's issue of the journal science . the current vaccine for whooping_cough , or pertussis , is part_of the `` dpt '' -lrb- for diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus -rrb- shot given most infants and young children . the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts about 60 million children a year world-wide , causing an_estimated one million deaths . the vaccine , however , causes allergic reactions that can_be fatal . the reactions stem_from the fact_that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole bordetella pertussis bacterium , which causes whooping_cough . this bacterium produces a toxin that , if used as a vaccine , can induce immunity to whooping_cough . unfortunately , the toxin is also poisonous . the italian-led scientific team said_0 they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin , which could_be used as a safe vaccine . the researchers reported 0 they have_been able_to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium . it turned_out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin , only one was responsible_for the toxin 's virulence . ordinarily in genetic_engineering each of these genes , minus the one that caused the virulence , would_have been transferred to another bacterium , called e. coli , which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin . the researchers said_0 they_did this , but the toxin did_n't induce immunity to whooping_cough . the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence . then , using a new technique -lrb- called homologous recombination -rrb- for introducing genes into cells , they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism . these bacterial `` cousins '' ordinarily do_n't make the toxin . but the genes were accompanied_by a piece of dna , called a promoter , that turns the genes on . the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which , because of the mutant virulence gene , was no_longer toxic . experiments showed that the new , non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity , according_to the researchers from the selavo research_center in siena , italy , the medical college of wisconsin in milwaukee and the japanese national_institutes of health .
