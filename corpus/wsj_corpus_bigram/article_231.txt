japan 's daiwa_securities co. named masahiro dozen president . mr._dozen succeeds sadakane doi , who will_become vice_chairman . yoshitoki chino retains his title of chairman of daiwa , japan 's_second-largest securities_firm . in japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one . the title of chief_executive officer is n't used . while people within daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that mr._dozen , 52 , would eventually become daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many . it was only earlier_this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with americans about how his_name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president . mr._dozen is taking_over the reins of a securities company that does very_well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment_banking and securities dealing . daiwa is one of the world 's_largest securities_firms . as of march_31 , the daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion_yen -lrb- $ 5.64 billion -rrb- . for the six_months ended_sept. 30 , daiwa reported unconsolidated -lrb- parent_company -rrb- net_income of 79.03 billion_yen -lrb- $ 556.5 million -rrb- on revenue of 332.38 billion_yen -lrb- $ 2.34 billion -rrb- . both figures were record highs . several observers interpreted mr._dozen 's appointment as an_attempt by daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased_competition . all of japan 's so-called big four securities_firms -- nomura_securities co. ltd. , the world 's_largest , nikko_securities co. ltd. , yamaichi securities co. ltd. and daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts_to break into foreign markets . while they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the eurobond market -- mostly for japanese firms -- they have_been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the u.s. . american institutional_investors have never had a large appetite_for japanese equities . and while the japanese have stepped_up their purchases of u.s. shares in the past_several months , they have_shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors . at the same_time , daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition_from well-entrenched american competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to u.s. corporations and institutional_investors . mr._dozen knows these problems firsthand . when he arrived in the u.s. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling japanese yen-denominated bonds to u.s. investors . `` he made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said koji yoneyama , president of daiwa 's u.s. unit . `` but not a single piece of paper was sold . '' by his_own account , mr._dozen did_n't do much better with u.s. bonds . in an_interview a few_months ago , he recalled how after some training at salomon_brothers inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 u.s. corporate bond issues . but he could_n't sell any . `` japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds ? maybe it 's crazy , '' he said . mr._dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the new_jersey shore and caught nothing . upon returning to new_york , `` exhausted , i got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled 0 . undaunted , mr._dozen said that daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some japanese flavor to it . '' he said that he was particularly interested_in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as_well as mergers and acquisitions . mr._dozen said_0 daiwa 's strengths were its large capital_base , its influential position in the tokyo market and its links to japanese corporations and institutional_investors . mr._dozen joined daiwa upon his graduation from kyoto university in 1959 . like many young recruits in japanese securities_firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual_investors . in his climb to the top , mr._dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations . `` he was constantly picking_up new things 0 to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said takuro isoda , chairman of daiwa 's u.s. unit in new_york . but it mr._dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail_sales force -- 0 to accede to the presidency . commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion_of japanese securities companies_' earnings . and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail_sales force `` would_be fragile , '' said_0 a daiwa executive . if mr._dozen has a weakness , it may_be his golf game . `` he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said mr. yoneyama .
