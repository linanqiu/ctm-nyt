the national_aeronautics and space_administration said_0 a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its galileo_space probe , which is to be launched today . charles redmond , a nasa spokesman , said_0 the agency discovered the virus on monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today . although the network is n't connected to the computer_systems that operate either galileo or the shuttle , part_of the network will carry analyses of galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn . mr. redmond said_0 the intruder had n't_yet done any harm but the agency feared 0 `` garbage data could_be substituted for real data . '' he estimated 0 it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer_system . the intruder , among the broadest yet 0 to hit a research network , appeared to affect only digital_equipment corp. hardware that uses digital 's vax\/vms operating_system . it is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last_year infected arpanet , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government_agencies around the world . in the lingo of computer security , the nasa intruder is technically a computer worm , mr. redmond said_0 . a worm resides in the operating_system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks . the galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in france hooked up to nasa 's space physics analysis network , mr. redmond said_0 . nasa said_0 the galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government_agencies because_they had modified their systems to reject worms . but mr. redmond said_0 the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . michael alexander , a senior editor at computerworld , a trade publication , said_0 he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking_for obvious passwords -- such_as ones that are the same as the user 's name . if it finds one and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user logs on that says , `` worms against nuclear killers ... . you talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare_for war . '' in_addition , mr._alexander said_0 , the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such_as , `` george orwell was an optimist , '' or `` do_n't feed the bats tonight . '' the worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user . the passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed_to be replaced as_soon as the system is up and running . if it finds one of those passwords , mr._alexander said_0 , the worm will do such things as change users ' passwords to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network . nasa estimated that , on monday , about four computer centers were affected . yesterday , the number grew to 40 ; today the number is_expected to grow to 100 . nasa said_0 it will_take about a week before it knows exactly how_many centers of the 6,000 connected to internet were affected and the extent of the damage , if any . anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the galileo_space probe to jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft . activists fear that if the shuttle carrying galileo into orbit should explode , or if galileo itself crashes into the earth during the two times 0 it flies close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would_be released into the atmosphere . so_far galileo has_been delayed twice , once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine , and yesterday because of the weather . nasa said_0 the galileo worm had nothing 0 to do with either delay . mr._alexander of computerworld said_0 hackers have_gone after span before . he said_0 the chaos computer club , of west_germany , once managed to invade span and do such things as 0 change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .
