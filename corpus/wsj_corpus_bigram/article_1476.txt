coca-cola_co. , aiming to boost soft-drink volume in singapore , said_0 it is discussing a joint_venture with fraser & neave ltd. , its bottling franchisee in that country . the venture would_be the latest in coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment . so_far this_year , it has put nearly $_700 million into bottling operations in australia , new_zealand and france . the move also reflects coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in pacific basin countries . aside_from europe , the pacific division is where coke will_be focusing much of its attention for years 0 to come . that 's because when coke looks to the pacific area , it sees an economic and demographic gold mine . in countries such_as taiwan , south_korea and singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft_drinks . and unlike europe and the u.s. , where populations are aging , the pacific basin countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of coca-cola and other sodas . a coca-cola spokesman_said 0 it is too_early to say how the joint_venture would_be structured , or how_much the company would invest in the transaction . in the past , however , coke has typically taken a minority_stake in such ventures . by acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the u.s. and overseas , coke has_been able_to improve bottlers ' efficiency and production , and in some_cases , marketing . coke has tended to increase its control when results_were sluggish in a given country . that does_n't appear to be the case in singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of coke 's success in a market . in singapore , per-capita consumption is about_one-third that of the u.s. . and combining fraser & neave 's own soft_drinks with coca-cola 's gives the singapore company more_than half the share of the soda market there , coke said_0 . fraser & neave , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the coke licenses for malaysia and brunei , where per-capita consumption is n't as high as in singapore . coke could_be interested_in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets . a coke spokesman_said 0 he could_n't say whether that is the direction of the talks . coke said_0 the joint-venture arrangement , which needs approval from both_companies ' boards , should_be completed early_next year .
