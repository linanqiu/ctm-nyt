texas_instruments inc. , once a pioneer in portable computer technology , today will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling three small personal_computers . the announcements are scheduled to be made in temple , texas , and include a so-called `` notebook '' pc that weighs less_than seven pounds , has a built-in hard_disk drive and is powered by intel_corp. 's 286 microprocessor . that introduction comes only two_weeks after compaq_computer corp. , believing 0 it had a lead of three to six_months on competitors , introduced the first u.s. notebook computer with such features . despite the inevitable comparison with compaq , however , texas_instruments ' new notebook wo_n't be a direct competitor . while compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers , texas_instruments will_be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers . the introductions also mark texas_instruments ' plunge back_into a technology 0 it has all but ignored for the past_several years . although the dallas-based computer_giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world 's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976 , the only portable machines 0 it has introduced since the first part_of the decade have_been `` dumb '' terminals with limited on-board processing ability . it stopped selling a standard personal_computer a while ago . now that is about to change , as texas_instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop pcs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives . the laptops are not revolutionary and , indeed , are tardy in a market first opened by grid systems corp. , now a unit of tandy_corp. , almost two_years ago . but the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard_disk , is more innovative . weighing 6.7 pounds with battery , the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches , has a 20-megabyte hard_disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22_% larger than compaq 's . its keyboard , according_to industry_consultants , is better_than compaq 's , but its battery life of two to three_hours is shorter . it_does n't have an_internal floppy disk_drive , although a snap-on drive can_be purchased separately . its greatest drawback may_be its 3-inch thickness , big enough for one consultant to describe it as `` clunky . '' list prices on the heavier texas instrument laptops will_be $ 4,999 for the ti model 25 , with a 20 megabyte disk_drive , and $ 5,599 for the 40-megabyte model 45 . the notebook , the ti model 12 , will_be priced_at $ 4,199 .
