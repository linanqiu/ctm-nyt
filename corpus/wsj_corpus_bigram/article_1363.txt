population drain ends for midwestern states iowa is making a comeback . so are indiana , ohio and michigan . the population of all four states is on the upswing , according_to new census_bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early_1980s . the gains , to be_sure , are rather small . iowa , for_instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4_% , between 1987 and 1988 , the census_bureau says_0 . still , even that modest increase is good_news for a state that had n't grown at all since_1981 . between 1987 and 1988 , north dakota was the only state in the midwest 0 to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . six of the 12 midwestern states have_been growing steadily since_1980 -- illinois , kansas , minnesota , missouri , south dakota and wisconsin . the northeast has_been holding its_own in the population race . seven of nine states have_grown each year since_1980 , including new_york , which lost 4_% of its population during the 1970s . and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they_are growing again . at the same_time , several states in the south and west have had their_own population turnaround . seven states that grew in the early_1980s are now losing population -- west_virginia , mississippi , louisiana , oklahoma , montana , wyoming and alaska . overall , though , the south and west still outpace the northeast and midwest , and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure_that the pattern will_continue . but the growth gap_between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing . more elderly maintain their independence thanks to modern medicine , more couples are growing old together . and even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent . a new census_bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 . this does_n't mean_0 they_'re less likely_to live alone , however . that share has remained at about 24_% since 1970 . what has_changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather_than with other relatives , such_as children . in 1988 , 10_% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15_% in 1970 . as people get even older , many become widowed . but even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose_slightly , to 40_% in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely_to live with other relatives . only 17_% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26_% in 1970 . the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40_% from 32_% . more people are remaining independent longer presumably because_they are better_off physically and financially . careers count most for the well-to-do many affluent people place personal success and money above family . at_least that 's what a survey by ernst_& young and yankelovich , clancy , shulman indicates . two-thirds of respondents said_0 they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer_than half said_0 they strongly felt the need to spend_more time with their_families . being successful in careers and spending the money 0 they make are top priorities for this group . unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich . average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 . the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the upper-middle class . although they represent only 2_% of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income . across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather_than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive . despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40_% of the respondents in the study do_n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do_n't feel that they have made it . twenty percent do_n't even feel 0 they_are financially well off . many of the affluent are n't comfortable_with themselves , either . about 40_% do_n't feel 0 they_'re more able than others . while twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25_% give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year . thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same_time , 60_% feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles . odds and ends the number_of women and minorities who hold jobs in top_management in the nation_'s largest banks has more_than doubled since 1978 . the american bankers_association says that women make up 47_% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33_% in 1978 . the share of minorities in those positions has_risen to 16_% from 12_% ... . per-capita personal_income in the u.s. grew faster_than inflation last_year , according_to the bureau of economic analysis . the amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 . per_capita personal_income ranged_from $ 11,116 in mississippi to $ 23,059 in connecticut ... . there_are 13.1 million students in college this_fall , up 2_% from 1988 , the national center for education statistics estimates 0 . about 54_% are women , and 44_% are part-time students .
