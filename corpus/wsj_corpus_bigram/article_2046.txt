the government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants : the power 0 to prevent them from paying their legal bills . and defense_lawyers are warning that they wo_n't stick around if_they do_n't get paid . the issue has come to a boil in newark , n.j. , where federal_prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former_chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted , the government may move to seize the money that mr._antar is using to pay legal_fees . the warning by the u.s._attorney 's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme_court last_june . in those cases , the high_court ruled_that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority 0 to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes , including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment . if the government succeeds in seizing mr._antar 's assets , he could_be left without top-flight legal representation , because his attorneys are_likely to quit , according_to individuals_familiar with the case . a seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers_' fees have_been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs . `` the people_who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the people_who suffer in the long_run are all of the people , because there wo_n't be a vigorous private bar 0 to defend the bill of rights , ''_says gerald lefcourt , a criminal_defense attorney who says_0 he has_turned down a number_of cases to_avoid possible fee seizures . mr._antar is being investigated by a federal_grand jury in newark , where prosecutors have told_him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges . under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law , or rico , the government has the authority 0 to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial . according_to individuals_familiar with mr._antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this_week after one of mr._antar 's attorneys asked_whether legal_fees might_be subject to seizure . in a letter , prosecutors told mr._antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme_court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from mr._antar may_be seized . prosecutors have told mr._antar 's attorneys that they believe_0 mr._antar 's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money 0 he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities . therefore , they said_0 , the money can_be taken from the lawyers even after they_are paid . justin feldman and jack arseneault , attorneys for mr._antar , both declined to comment_on the matter . in newark , u.s._attorney samuel a. alito said , ``_i do_n't think_0 there 's any legal reason 0 to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases . '' mr. alito said_0 his office `` just responded to an_attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . '' mr._antar was charged last_month in a civil suit_filed in federal_court in newark by the securities and exchange_commission . in that suit , the sec accused mr._antar of engaging in a `` massive financial fraud '' to overstate the earnings of crazy eddie , edison , n.j. , over a three-year period . through his lawyers , mr._antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil_suits previously filed by shareholders against mr._antar and others . the sec has alleged that mr._antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial_statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits . mr._antar , the sec said_0 , made more_than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987 . the justice_department has emphasized that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be_used sparingly . according_to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers_' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made . still , criminal_defense lawyers worry_that defendants are_being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers_' fees . they also worry_that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly , the best defense_lawyers will_be unwilling to take criminal cases unless_they are assured of being paid .
