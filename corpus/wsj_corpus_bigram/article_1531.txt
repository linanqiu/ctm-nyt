few people in the advertising business have raised as many hackles as alvin a. achenbaum . the general public may_not know his_name , but he 's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles : a marketing consultant , he pioneered slashing ad_agency commissions , to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies . now , after beating them , mr._achenbaum is joining them . backer_spielvogel bates worldwide named mr._achenbaum , 62 , vice_chairman of professional services , reporting directly to carl spielvogel , chairman and chief_executive officer . he joins nov._13 , dissolving his consulting_firm , canter , achenbaum associates . in years past , the ad industry 's most distinguished executives did_n't hesitate to excorciate mr._achenbaum . they have since mellowed , although one senior young_& rubicam executive , echoing others , said : ``_i think_0 ad_agencies owe carl -lcb- spielvogel -rcb- a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . '' but industry_executives also believe_0 hiring mr._achenbaum is a shrewd move for backer_spielvogel , a unit of saatchi_& saatchi . mr._achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including nissan , toyota , seagram and backer_spielvogel clients hyundai and j.p._morgan . at backer_spielvogel , he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies ; aside_from agency compensation issues , he helped nissan , for_example , come_up with its positioning and pricing for its new infiniti line . his_client contacts , meanwhile , could_prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late . ``_i 've_done over 40 ad_agency searches -lcb- for clients -rcb- , so i have a pretty_good notion of what clients are interested_in when they look for an agency , '' mr._achenbaum said . as a consultant , he has given seminars at agencies including ogilvy_& mather on how to win new business . mr._spielvogel said_0 he hopes 0 mr._achenbaum will do some strategic consulting at the agency for `` non-clients , in hopes that they become clients . '' at backer_spielvogel , mr._spielvogel 's hallmark has_been personal involvement with all major clients . he pampers them ; he invites them to fabulous parties ; he strokes them . mr._achenbaum , too , delves into his clients_' business . `` carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size . and with al 's record of being a delver and a detail guy , you_can see_how the two fit , '' said alan gottesman , an_analyst with painewebber . mr._achenbaum 's move follows the announcement last_month that his consulting partner , stanley canter , 66 , would retire . when the announcement came out , ``_i picked_up the phone and said , ` why do_n't you come to us ? ' '' mr._spielvogel said_0 . mr._achenbaum , who had_been considering paring down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit , soon agreed . the two_men are longtime friends and tennis partners , having met about 25 years_ago . before becoming a consultant in 1974 , mr._achenbaum was a senior_executive at j._walter thompson co . he spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies , but became best-known for chipping away at ad_agency compensation . ad_agencies typically earned a straight 15_% commission ; if a client spent $_100 million on tv time , the agency made $ 15 million . but mr._achenbaum pioneered negotiated fees , which often worked_out to less_than 15_% . more recently , he negotiated `` indemnification '' clauses in which an ad_agency in some_cases must_pay a client if it drops the account . he ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation , however , that clients did_n't seek him out for anything_else . ``_i was very frustrated , '' he said . `` the fact of the matter is , 0 i_am a marketer . that 's another_reason -lcb- for the backer_spielvogel job -rcb- . it struck me as a way_0 to get_back to what i really want to do . '' mr._spielvogel added pointedly : `` the pressure_on commissions did_n't begin with al achenbaum . '' mr._spielvogel said_0 mr._achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion , merchandising , publicity and other marketing outlets , and to integrate those services . he will concentrate_on , among_others , j.p._morgan and hyundai . mr._achenbaum helped morgan in its recent agency search , and he has a long relationship_with hyundai , which is having severe troubles , including declining sales . `` the trail of revenue is increasingly going away_from pure advertising , and going towards other services , '' mr._spielvogel said . instead of being just an ad_agency , he said_0 : ``_we have redefined our mission here . our mission is to help our clients grow , and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that . '' industry_executives are wishing mr._achenbaum well . leonard matthews , then-president of the american association of advertising_agencies , called mr._achenbaum a `` quisling '' in an incendiary 1987 speech . yesterday , mr. matthews , now a consultant with the stamford , conn. , firm matthews & johnston , quipped , ``_i think_0 he 'll_be very_good at that -lcb- new job -rcb- . and much better at that than at -lcb- the price-cutting -rcb- 0 he 's been doing recently .

's president and chief_executive , was an outspoken critic of wpp_group 's acquisition of ogilvy group earlier_this year . during the takeover , mr._hahn said_0 he would put his account up for review if wpp 's bid were successful , but he did_n't . cotton inc.

'' the campaign replaces its `` take comfort in cotton '' ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts . for years , the company 's ads were tied in with pitches for cannon sheets or martex towels , for_example , and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to `` find the true performance label .
