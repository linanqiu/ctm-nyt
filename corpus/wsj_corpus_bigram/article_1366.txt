of all the ethnic tensions in america , which is the most troublesome right_now ? a good bet would_be the tension_between blacks and jews in new_york city . or so it must seem to jackie mason , the veteran jewish comedian appearing in a new abc sitcom airing on tuesday nights -lrb- 9:30-10 p.m._edt -rrb- . not_only is mr._mason the star of `` chicken soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` duck soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water . here , in neutral language , is the gist of mr._mason 's remarks , quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph_giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in newsweek after he and the campaign parted company . mr._mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically . he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically . he said that jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa . of course , mr._mason did_not use neutral language . as a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the borscht belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , mr._mason instinctively reached for the vernacular . he said_0 jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called david_dinkins , mr._giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . '' if mr._mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his_fellow new yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ? it probably would , because few or none of the people upset by mr._mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact_that he used insulting language . in_addition , some of mr._mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . for_example , the new_york state counsel for the naacp said that mr._mason is `` like a dinosaur . people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' these critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such_as `` polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as_well as outward . the latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along_with themselves . in the hands of a zealot like lenny bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons . but wielded by a pro like jackie mason , it is a constructive form of mischief . why constructive ? because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they_are similar in one respect : both can serve_as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . that 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences . as elizabeth kristol wrote in the new_york times just before the mason donnybrook , `` perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . '' the question is , if group conflicts still exist -lrb- as undeniably they do -rrb- , and if mr._mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? do_n't say_0 the tv sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more_than it_does comedy . it is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar bostonians in `` cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` the cosby show . '' but these are not the differences that make headlines . in `` chicken soup , '' mr._mason plays jackie , a jewish bachelor courting maddie -lrb- lynn redgrave -rrb- , an irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his_mother -lrb- rita karin -rrb- and her brother michael -lrb- brandon maggart -rrb- . it 's worth noting_that both disapproving relatives are immigrants . at_least , they both speak with strong accents , as do jackie and maddie . it could_n't be more obvious that `` chicken soup '' is being made from an old recipe . and a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an orthodox jew and a member of the nation of islam . back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` abie 's irish rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of jewish and irish immigrants so popular that its author , anne nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain . and it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 cbs sitcom called `` bridget loves bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of meredith baxter and david birney . clearly , the question with `` chicken soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all . so_far , the bubbles have_been few and far between . part_of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever_since the didactic days of norman lear , to preach about social issues . to some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries_to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . for_instance , michael dislikes jackie not because he 's a shrewd jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and mr._mason 's comic persona . the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -lrb- and occasionally in the middle -rrb- , when mr._mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned jewish mischief to other people as_well as to himself . but too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting mr._mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences . i_'m not suggesting_that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the catholic-jewish dispute_over the carmelite convent at auschwitz . that issue , like racial tensions in new_york city , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer . but i_am suggesting_that they stop requiring mr._mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of miss america . at your age , jackie , you ought_to know that you_ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .
