when president_bush travels to costa_rica today , he 'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels . but the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central_america . some conservatives say_0 mr._bush should n't make the trip , during which he will participate_in costa_rica 's celebration of 100 years of democracy . these critics object to mr._bush 's participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan president daniel ortega among the guests . in_addition , they_argue 0 he wo_n't help washington 's standing in the region by trumpeting the u.s. commitment to democracy less_than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed_coup attempt in panama . ``_i believe_0 it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like daniel ortega , ''_says curtin windsor , who served_as u.s._ambassador to costa_rica during the reagan_administration . mr. windsor , among_other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation , fears 0 the gathering of 18 leaders , mostly from central american nations , will force mr._bush `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake_of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel_noriega . at the same_time , liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of mr._bush 's joining a celebration of costa_rican democracy at a time 0 his administration has sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country . the administration proposed only $ 57 million in so-called economic support funds for costa_rica this_year , down from the $ 90 million 0 the u.s. provided last_year . the administration said_0 improvements in costa_rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid , which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $_4.5 billion foreign_debt . but costa_rican officials argue_that the recent drop in coffee prices , combined_with the country 's continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy , make the support as necessary as ever . ``_we are crossing the river and we_need a little more help to get to the other_side , '' said rodrigo sotela , an economic_affairs specialist at the costa_rican embassy in washington . democrats argue_that costa_rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that mr._bush is attending the celebration this weekend : to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to_promote peace in nicaragua . however , peace efforts by costa_rican president oscar arias have n't_always helped the country 's cause in washington . mr. arias 's long-time refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the ire of the reagan white_house . and more recently , he insisted on signing a five-nation agreement intended_to disarm nicaragua 's u.s.-backed contra_rebels faster_than the bush_administration would_prefer . ``_i think_0 bush 's going there_is a helpful sign , '' said sen. terry sanford -lrb-_d. , n.c . -rrb- a member of the foreign_relations committee who pushed to provide costa_rica about the same_amount of aid as it received last_year . lawmakers in both_houses support the higher level . administration_officials defend mr._bush 's decision to make the trip . while they acknowledge 0 the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by mr._ortega , they insist_that mr._bush wo_n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special courtesies . the administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent_days , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition , renewing the u.s._trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region . officials also insist 0 mr._bush will use the trip to highlight his_own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries . `` let_me say_0 there_is a symbolic component to this trip , '' secretary of state james_baker told_reporters wednesday . `` there wo_n't be any formal resolutions or communiques , i_do n't_think 0 . but we still see this as an_opportunity to_discuss many , many very_important issues .
