california thefts make travel agents jittery being a travel agent used to be pretty glamorous . now it 's getting downright dangerous . in recent_months , more_than 25 agencies have_been robbed , compared_with only a_handful all last_year , according_to police and travel-agency groups . most of the cases have_been in california , where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed . los_angeles police say_0 the thieves seem to be part_of a crime network that knows_how to convert blank tickets into real ones . already , the stolen tickets have_been used for flights all over the world . so_far , the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets , according_to airline reporting corp. , a ticket processing center . police say_0 the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men , who walk into the agencies near_closing or lunch time , when few employees are there . `` they looked_like ordinary vacationers at first , ''_says willy llerena , owner of travel air service in monte bello , calif. , describing five men who entered his agency last_june . but then , he_says 0 , they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded 0 he open the safe . when he initially refused , he_says 0 , they stabbed him in the back and made off with $_2,000 and 280 blank tickets . `` they said_0 they wanted to show me how serious they_were , '' he_says . as word of the crime spree has spread , many agents have started changing their open-door policies . at el monte travel center in el monte , calif. , customers now can_get in only through a buzzer and lock system . `` it 's hard to deal_with clients this way in a service business , ''_says ralph `` bud '' conner , owner of the agency , which was robbed of 180 blank tickets and $ 850 last_month . `` but we_'re just too nervous . '' the robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines . agents say_0 airlines , which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets , should_be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they_'re used . `` they have the most sophisticated computers in the world , ''_says mr. llerena . `` they ought_to be_able to do this . '' but airlines say_0 it would_be too expensive and cause too_many delays if_they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate . texans get reasonable car_rental insurance consumer advocates have long claimed that car_rental companies charge too_much for car_rental insurance . now , a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof . the law -- the first of its kind -- requires car_rental companies in texas to charge only `` reasonable '' rates for collision-damage waiver insurance . specifically , the law says_0 the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have_been to replace damaged cars . before the law went_into effect last_month , car_rental companies were charging as_much as $ 12 a day for the waiver in texas . now , they_'re charging as little $_3 a day . `` if_they 're telling the truth now , then they_'ve been charging 300 % more_than what is reasonable , ''_says steve gardner , an assistant state_attorney general in texas . a spokesman for hertz_corp. acknowledges , `` the waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers , but a source of revenue . '' but hertz points out that at_least it 's now charging only $ 3.95 a day in texas , while some competitors are charging $ 6.99 . the state_attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher_prices . flight_attendants lag before jets even land if your flight attendant seems a little weary , it may_be because he or she has_been working 20 straight hours . a recent study for the federal_aviation administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight_attendants work 16 hours or more straight -- despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to 14 hours . some flight_attendants on charter planes are putting in 20-hour work days , the study found 0 . this happens because the faa does_n't have any rules on duty time for flight_attendants ; by_contrast , it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers , usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours . `` as far as the faa is concerned , ''_says matt finucane , air safety director at the association of flight_attendants , `` flight_attendants can work an unlimited number_of hours . '' experts_say 0 such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk . for_instance , tired flight_attendants might_not react quickly enough during an_emergency evacuation . `` at the end of their day , they_are zombies , ''_says john galipault , president of the aviation safety institute , a public-interest group in worthington , ohio . `` they have to work such long hours and then we_expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation . '' in response to the study , the faa says_0 it is_considering changing its policy -- or lack_of it -- on flight_attendants . the agency may_not have much choice : a congressional bill has_been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on u.s. flights and 16 hours on international trips . odds and ends golf has_become the latest diversion for travelers stuck at some airports . simulated golf games , in which players hit golf balls into nets , have_been installed at airports in denver and pittsburgh ... . the average cost for breakfast at a `` decent '' hotel restaurant in new_york is $ 17.12 , according_to corporate travel magazine . the cheapest , among 100 cities surveyed , was $ 5.11 in el_paso , texas .
