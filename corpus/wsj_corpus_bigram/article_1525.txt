japanese_investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual_funds totaling_$ 701 million , the u.s. federal_national mortgage_association said_0 . the purchases show the strong interest of japanese_investors in u.s. mortgage-based instruments , fannie_mae 's chairman , david o. maxwell , said_0 at a news_conference . he said_0 more_than 90_% of the funds were placed with japanese institutional_investors . the rest went to investors from france and hong_kong . earlier_this year , japanese_investors snapped_up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed_securities mutual_fund . that fund was put_together by blackstone group , a new_york investment_bank . the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman , sachs_& co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa_securities co . the new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london_interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to japanese_investors . first , they_are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed_securities can_be retired early if interest_rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates . second , they channel monthly mortgage_payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors . by addressing those problems , mr. maxwell said_0 , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. . '' such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed_securities to more_than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate . they also have become large purchasers of fannie_mae 's corporate debt , buying $_2.4 billion in fannie_mae bonds during the first_nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued .
