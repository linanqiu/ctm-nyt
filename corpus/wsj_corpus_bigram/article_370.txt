opec 's ability_to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets . output from the organization of petroleum exporting_countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out . but industry and opec officials agree that a_handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few_months from now if opec does_n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters . as a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next_month is taking on increasing urgency . the organization is_scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. 25 . so_far this_year , rising demand_for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others . but that could change if demand_for opec 's oil softens seasonally early_next year as some think_0 may happen . opec is currently producing more_than 22_million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according_to opec and industry officials at an oil conference_here sponsored_by the oil daily and the international herald tribune . at that rate , a majority of opec 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said_0 . but it is estimated that at_least three million_barrels a day -- and possibly as_much as seven million_barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within opec . most is concentrated in five persian_gulf countries , including his_own , issam al-chalabi , iraq 's oil minister , told the conference friday . he puts opec 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million_barrels a day . that 's higher_than some other estimates . ali khalifa al-sabah , kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated opec capacity at 25 million_barrels a day . either_way , the overhang is big enough to_keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge . even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such_as saudi_arabia and iraq , could upset the market . the iraqi oil minister and saudi oil minister hisham nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market . however , in interviews later , both ministers stressed_that they_expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production_capacity and reserves of each member . under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system . `` if_you are already producing at 95_% or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told 0 you_can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked mr. al-chalabi . at an inconclusive geneva meeting late_last month , opec 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million_barrels a day in their production ceiling . they doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could_n't produce more received higher official allotments . the main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters . still , there was a breakthrough at geneva . previously , no opec member had_been willing_to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling . but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers . in the end politics got in the way . libya accepted iran 's proposal only so_long as it was promised production parity with kuwait . and the united arab emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused_to give any guarantee 0 it would change its ways . but the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will_probably be the basis for discussion at next_month 's meeting . it 's understood 0 several compromises already have_been worked into the plan . the ceiling would_be lifted to 21.5_million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others . libya 's previous conditions are no_longer considered a problem , although the united arab emirates is still an issue . saudi_arabia , opec 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some opec sources_said 0 . insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . in geneva , however , they supported iran 's proposal because it would_have left the saudi percentage of the opec total intact , and increased actual saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million_barrels daily from five million . some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on saudi_arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels . though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . mr. nazer , the saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any quota revisions . `` under any circumstances , saudi_arabia should get more '' rather_than less , mr. nazer said .
