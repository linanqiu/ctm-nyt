the stock_market went on a dizzying ride as ual , parent of united_airlines , once_again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback . at the end of it all , the dow_jones industrial_average closed_down 3.69 to 2659.22 . at one_point yesterday_morning , the dow was down 80.53 points . new_york stock_exchange volume_was 237,960,000 shares . declining_issues swamped advancers , 1,222 to 382 . yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190-point_plunge on friday the 13th , the stock_market still has a bad case of nerves . takeover_stock speculation and futures-related program_trading drove the industrial_average through wide ranges . and there_is more volatility to come . `` october 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve , '' said jack solomon , technical analyst for bear_stearns . `` people are fearful and sensitive . everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the button . i have never had as many calls as i had this_morning . volatility is here to stay . '' the dow_jones industrial_average plunged about 80_points in slightly_more than one hour after the opening_bell . for many , it began to look_like a replay of oct._13 . as stocks and stock-index_futures fell , a trading limit was hit in the s&p_500 stock futures_pit . under a post-1987 crash reform , the chicago_mercantile exchange would n't permit the december s&p_futures to fall further than 12 points for a half_hour . that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big_board . but at a critical moment , stock-index_arbitrage traders showed their power and control . they scooped up hundreds_of s&p_futures when the market needed it most . at about 10:40 a.m._edt , several big buy_orders hit the s&p pit simultaneously , lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven_program buying of stocks . `` it is very_clear that those buy_orders came from people_who wanted their franchise protected , '' said one chicago-based futures trader . `` these_guys wanted to do_something to show how powerful they_are . '' traders_said 0 goldman_sachs , shearson_lehman hutton and salomon_brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment . shearson_lehman hutton declined to comment . officials at goldman_sachs and salomon_brothers were_unavailable for comment . as in the oct._13 massacre , yesterday_morning 's drop was_triggered by bad_news for speculators in ual . a ual statement after the market closed monday indicated_that the airline 's board wanted to_keep the company independent , effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out . five_minutes before the big_board opened , a preliminary price was flashed for ual -- somewhere_between 135 and 155 , a loss of as_much as $ 43 a_share from monday 's close . ual finally opened for trading at 10:08 a.m. at 150 , down $ 28 . floor_traders said_0 there was a huge crowd around the big_board specialist 's post where ual trades . `` there was a seething mass of people , '' said one floor trader . `` then there was a big liquidation of stock '' across the board , he_added . takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more_than $_700 million on ual -- started selling other stocks as_well as s&p_futures in an_attempt to hedge against a further ual blood bath . shortly_after the ual opening , program_traders started selling stocks in the major market index and s&p_500 index . the 20-stock mmi mimics the dow_jones industrial_average . by 10:30 a.m. the dow was down 62.70 . all 20-stocks in the mmi except exxon , general_motors and sears were down $_1 to $_2 . at 10:33 , when the s&p_500 december futures_contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell_programs , s&p_futures trading was_halted and program_trades on the big_board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances . under the rules adopted by the chicago_mercantile exchange , the futures_contract can_not drop below the limit , but buyers can purchase futures . at this point , the dow_industrials were down 75.41 points and falling . the trading_halt in the s&p_500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion , many traders maintain 0 . but as the fright began to spread through the s&p pit , the big brokerage_firms came in and bought futures aggressively . `` it was whooosh ! '' said one futures trader . in five_minutes , the dow_industrials climbed almost 30 points . the big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the dow 's loss to 31 points by 11 a.m . traders_said 0 the futures buying was finely calculated_by program_traders . these firms sold stock into the big morning decline , but seeing the velocity of the market 's drop , held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the s&p_futures hit the trading limit . then they completed the other_side of the trade by buying futures , which abruptly halted the stock_market 's decline as traders began to buy stocks . from then on , the dow_industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points . then , in late-afternoon trading , hundred-thousand-share buy_orders for ual hit the market , including a 200,000-share order through bear_stearns that seemed to spark ual 's late price surge . almost simultaneously , painewebber began a very visible buy program for dozens_of stocks . the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain , before closing at a slight loss . some institutional traders loved the wild ride . `` this is fun , '' asserted susan del signore , head equity trader_at travelers investment_management co . she said_0 she used the market 's wild_swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell-off . on the comeback , ms. del signore unloaded shares 0 she has_been aiming to get_rid of . but traders who risk money handling big_blocks of stock were shaken . `` this market is eating away my youth , '' said chung lew , head equity trader_at kleinwort_benson north_america inc . `` credibility sounds intangible . but i_think 0 we are losing credibility because when the market does this , it_does n't present itself as a rational investment . but if_you overlook all this , it is a beautiful market for investment still . '' traders attributed rallies in a number_of stocks to a japanese buy program that painewebber carried_out as_part of a shift in portfolio strategy , according_to dow_jones professional_investor report . dow_jones climbed 5 3\/4 to 41 on very heavy_volume of 786,100 shares . analysts said_0 a big japanese buy order was behind the rise . a dow_jones spokesman_said 0 there_were no corporate developments that would account for the activity . other issues said to be included in the buy program were procter_& gamble , which rose_2 7\/8 to 133 1\/2 ; atlantic_richfield , which gained_2 to 103 3\/4 , and rockwell_international , which jumped_2 3\/4 to 27 1\/8 . painewebber declined to comment . ual finished_at 170 , off 8_3\/8 . other airline_stocks fell in response to the ual_board 's decision to remain_independent for now , including usair_group , which separately reported a third-quarter_loss of $ 1.86 a_share compared_with a year-ago profit . usair fell 2_1\/2 to 40 . amr , the parent of american_airlines , fell_1 3\/4 to 68 7\/8 on 2.3_million shares ; delta_air lines lost_1 1\/2 to 66 , southwest airlines slid 3\/4 to 24 1\/4 and midway airlines dropped 1\/4 to 14 7\/8 . texas_air , which_owns continental and eastern_airlines , lost 3\/8 to 13 1\/8 on the american_stock exchange . metals stocks also were especially weak , as concerns_about the earnings outlook for cyclical companies weighed on the group . aluminum co. of america dropped_1 1\/2 to 70 1\/4 , phelps dodge fell 4 to 59 7\/8 , asarco lost_1 3\/8 to 31 3\/4 , reynolds metals slid 1_3\/8 to 50 3\/8 , amax dropped_1 1\/8 to 21 5\/8 and cyprus minerals skidded 2 to 26 3\/4 . alcan aluminium was an exception , as it gained_1 3\/8 to 23 on two million_shares . goodyear tire & rubber tumbled 2 7\/8 to 43 7\/8 . its third-quarter_earnings were higher_than a year_ago , but fell short of expectations . other stocks in the dow_industrials that failed to benefit from the market 's rebound included united technologies , which dropped_1 to 53 5\/8 , and bethle hem steel , which fell_1 to 16 7\/8 . bankamerica dropped_1 1\/4 to 29 1\/2 on 2.3_million shares amid rumors_that the earthquake last_week in the san_francisco area had caused structural_damage to its_headquarters building . the company denied the rumors and noted_that it_does n't own the building . stocks of california-based thrifts also were hard hit . great_western financial lost_1 1\/8 to 20 1\/2 on 1.6_million shares , golden_west financial dropped_1 1\/4 to 28 1\/2 and h.f._ahmanson dipped 5\/8 to 21 1\/4 . homefed plunged 3 5\/8 to 38 1\/2 ; its third-quarter_earnings were down from a year_ago . golden valley microwave foods skidded 3 5\/8 to 31 3\/4 after warning that its fourth-quarter results could_be hurt_by `` some fairly large international marketing expenses .
