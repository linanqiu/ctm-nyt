dell computer corp. , squeezed by price pressure_from its larger competitors and delays in its new product_line , said_0 its per-share_earnings for fiscal_1990 will_be half its previous forecasts . although the personal_computer maker said_0 it_expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ 385 million for the year_ending jan. 28 , 1990 , earnings are_expected to be 25_cents to 35_cents a_share , down from previous estimates of 50_cents to 60 cents . earnings for fiscal_1989 were $ 14.4 million , or 80_cents a_share , on sales of $ 257.8 million . results for the third_quarter ending oct._31 , are_expected to be_released the third week of november , according_to michael dell , chairman and chief_executive officer . mr. dell said_0 he does_n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth_quarter , but said_0 third-quarter_earnings could_be as low as four cents_a share . in the third_quarter last_year , dell had net_income of $_5 million , or 26_cents a_share , on sales of $ 75.2 million . mr. dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays , such_as a laptop scheduled for september that wo_n't be introduced until early_november . some delays have_been caused_by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably intel_corp. 's newest chip , the 486 -- but others apparently have_been caused_by dell 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources . `` they_'ve got a_lot of different balls in the air at the same_time , '' observes jim poyner , a computer securities analyst_with dallas-based william k. woodruff &_co . mr. dell , meanwhile , concedes 0 the company was `` definitely too optimistic '' in its expectations . product delays , however , have left dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop_computers , as powerhouse competitors compaq_computer corp. and international_business machines_corp. price their pcs more aggressively . the result has_been thinner margins , which have_been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion . analyst james weil of the soundview financial group believes_0 dell 's response has_been to place increased emphasis_on product quality , `` in an_effort to rise above some of that price pressure . '' but that has_been the key to compaq 's success , he_adds 0 , whereas dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might_be too_late in the game for a shift in strategy . in national_over-the-counter trading , dell closed_yesterday at $_6 a_share , down 87.5_cents .
