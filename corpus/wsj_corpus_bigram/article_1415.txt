government_officials here and in other_countries laid plans through the weekend to head_off a monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to_keep their moves quiet . federal_reserve chairman_alan greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the u.s. and abroad that the fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking_system , as it did in october_1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial_crisis . and at the treasury , secretary_nicholas brady talked with friends and associates on_wall street while assistant_secretary david mullins carefully analyzed data on the friday market_plunge . but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . in_addition , officials at the fed and in the bush_administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would_give them more strength and flexibility should friday_'s market drop turn_into this_morning 's rout . `` the disadvantage at this point is that anything 0 you_do that looks_like you are doing too_much tends_to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity . the fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled sunday morning , when both the new_york times and the washington_post carried stories quoting a senior fed official saying_0 the central_bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking_system monday_morning . fed_chairman greenspan was surprised by both stories , according_to knowledgeable sources , and insisted 0 he had n't authorized any public comment . nevertheless , fed officials acknowledged 0 the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central_bank 's game plan . it is prepared to assume the same role 0 it played in october_1987 , providing money to the markets if_necessary to_keep the financial system afloat . the fed provides money to the banking_system by buying government securities from financial_institutions . the reticence of federal officials was_evident in the appearance sunday of budget_director richard_darman on abc 's `` this_week . '' `` secretary of the treasury brady and chairman_greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others have_been in close contact . i_'m sure_0 they_'ll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said . when it was suggested 0 his comment was a `` non-answer , '' mr. darman replied : `` it is a non-answer . but , in this context , that 's the smart thing 0 to do . '' at the treasury , secretary brady issued a statement minimizing the stock_market 's drop . `` today 's stock_market decline does_n't signal any fundamental_change in the condition of the economy , '' he said . `` the economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' but administration_officials conceded_that friday_'s drop carried the chance of further_declines this_week . `` one possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . `` the other is that we see another major disaster , like two_years ago . i_think 0 that 's less likely . '' nevertheless , fed_chairman greenspan and vice_chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world . the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new_zealand foreign_exchange markets at 5_p.m. est -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this_morning in europe . both the treasury and the fed planned to_keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . in tokyo , share prices dropped_sharply by 1.7_% in early monday_morning trading . after the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning_around but by early afternoon was headed lower . in the bush_administration , the lead is being taken by treasury_secretary brady , undersecretary robert glauber and assistant_secretary mullins . the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission , headed_by mr._brady , which was established after the 1987_crash to examine the market 's collapse . as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial_markets , and financial market crises . mr._brady was at the white_house friday_afternoon when the stock_market 's decline began . he was quickly on the phone with mr. mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the new_york and chicago exchanges . later , mr._brady phoned mr._greenspan , sec_chairman richard_breeden and numerous contacts in new_york and overseas . aides say_0 he continued to work the phones through the weekend . administration_officials say_0 president_bush was briefed throughout friday_afternoon and evening , even after leaving for camp david . he had frequent telephone consultations with mr._brady and michael boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . government_officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to_avoid any sense of panic . treasury undersecretary david mulford , for_instance , was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs , va. , when the stock_market fell , and remained there through the following day . and as of last_night , fed_chairman greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the american bankers_association convention in washington at 10_a.m. this_morning . ironically , mr._greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in dallas on_oct. 20 , 1987 . he flew to dallas on_oct. 19 , when the market plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to washington without delivering his speech .
