ogilvy_& mather , whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by wpp_group earlier_this year , will see its profit_margins bounce_back to the `` 11.5_% range '' in 1990 , said_0 graham phillips , the agency 's new chairman-elect . the ad_agency 's pretax_profit margins were slightly under 10_% at the time of the takeover , according_to analysts ; london-based wpp 's goal is to increase margins to 12_% . mr._phillips made his comments during an_interview detailing his plans for the agency . british-born , the 24-year ogilvy veteran was_named last_week to succeed kenneth roman , who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at american_express , an ogilvy client . surrounded_by stacks of paper , two computers and photos of himself boating and flying , mr._phillips laid out several changes 0 he hopes to make at the agency . first and foremost , mr._phillips said_0 he hopes to improve client service . ogilvy under the fastidious mr._roman gained a reputation_as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed , must -- follow . and some of its top client-service executives , including mr._phillips , were promoted to the point 0 they_were saddled with administrative duties , with little time 0 to see clients . but mr._phillips recently freed himself up to spend_more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy . he also plans to get to know clients that mr._roman was closer to , such_as lever brothers , american_express and seagram . the two_men are planning joint visits to a number_of clients to attempt_to smoothly hand over the reins . `` clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month , but two or three_times a week , '' he said . mr._phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier_this year but put on hold by the wpp takeover . the reorganization is supposed_to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public_relations and design all in one place , or `` ogilvy orchestration '' in ogilvyspeak -- a reality . under the reorganization , ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a `` client service director '' 0 to work as the client 's single contact for all those services . `` there_is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there_is no single focus , '' mr._phillips complained to staffers in march , when the reorganization was announced . now mr._phillips says_0 he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients --_including american_express , american_telephone &_telegraph and ryder -- by year 's end . industry_executives and analysts are divided on whether mr._phillips is up to the task . he is n't as well-known to clients as is mr._roman . under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's new_york operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more_than a year . and while last_week the agency hired a top chiat\/day\/mojo executive , bill hamilton , 0 to try_to bolster its work , `` graham has to get the revenue of that new_york office moving , ''_says james dougherty , an_analyst with county_natwest securities . the one_thing 0 mr._phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will_be enough . as mr. dougherty says , `` the last thing 0 they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia , 0 as we call it . '' mr._phillips and mr._roman are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style . while mr._roman is a workaholic detailsman , mr._phillips would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the office . mr._roman , by_contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at ogilvy 's halloween party friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck . '' mr._phillips said_0 the company 's expected margin improvement will_be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this_year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new new_york headquarters . the move , budgeted at about $ 7 million , actually came in at about $ 10 million , he said_0 . but margins will_be helped , too , by some other cost-saving steps . ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go half a dozen financial executives . wpp , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in ogilvy 's new headquarters_building to outsiders . the fact_that the agency will now be part_of a u.k. company , under british accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better . y&r 's klein steps down arthur klein , president of young_& rubicam 's new_york office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake_of charges by a federal_grand jury in new_haven , conn. , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 . in an_internal memo , alex kroll , the agency 's chairman , said_0 mr. klein decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare_for his defense . `` the fact_that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact_on y&r , '' mr. kroll wrote . he said_0 mr. klein will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which he will_be vindicated . '' mr. klein will work with mr. kroll on some of the agency 's joint_venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending . peter georgescu , president of y&r 's ad operations , will_assume mr. klein 's day-to-day role . wells_rich 's new partner wells , rich , greene named cheryl heller as an executive_vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising . ms. heller , 38 , had headed up boston agency heller\/breene , a unit of wcrs . the agency , with about $ 35 million in billings , will_be dissolved , with some of its staffers absorbed by wcrs 's della_femina mcnamee unit in boston , ms. heller said_0 . she said_0 it was too_early to say what would happen to its clients , including reebok and apple . at wells_rich , ms. heller will concentrate_on accounts that include philip_morris 's benson_& hedges cigarette brand , which relies_on print ads , ms. heller 's specialty . as previously_reported , the account is troubled , with philip_morris asking backer_spielvogel bates , ogilvy_& mather , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work . wells_rich declined to comment_on the status of the account , as did the other agencies .
