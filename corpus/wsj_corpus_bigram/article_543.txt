as the sponsor of the `` older americans freedom to work act , '' which would repeal the social_security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , i applaud your strong endorsement 0 to repeal this depression-era fossil . for every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , social_security recipients lose 50_cents of their social_security benefits ; it 's like a 50_% marginal tax . but the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax_rates . imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level 0 she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax . although this widow earns only twice the minimum_wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would_have to earn an_additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 . eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit . repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased social_security benefit payments . we now need support from the democrats on the rules committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the reconciliation_bill . since all four republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the democrats who will_be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor . the time is now 0 to lift the burdensome social_security earnings limit from the backs of our nation_'s seniors . rep. j. dennis hastert -lrb-_r. , ill . -rrb-
