international_business machines_corp. will_announce on tuesday a slew of software products aimed_at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing_operations , industry_executives said_0 . many plant floors currently resemble a tower of babel , with computers , robots and machine_tools that generally speak their_own language and have trouble talking to each_other . as a result , if a problem develops on a production line , it is unlikely 0 some supervisor sitting in front of a personal_computer or workstation will know about it or be_able to correct it . so ibm will_be announcing more_than 50 products that will_be aimed_at letting even the dumbest machine_tool talk to the smartest mainframe , or anything in between . in an_unusual display of openness , ibm also will_be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by ibm 's competitors . in_addition , the executives said_0 ibm will_be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad-hoc software , for_instance , 0 to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line . in armonk , n.y. , an ibm spokeswoman confirmed_that ibm executives will_be announcing some computer-integrated-manufacturing plans next_week but declined to elaborate . the industry_executives said that , as_usual with such broad announcements from ibm , this one will_be part reality and part strategy . so it will_take many quarters for ibm to roll out all the products that customers need , and it will_take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations . also as_usual , the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of ibm equipment , at_least initially . still , consultants and industry_executives said_0 the products could help make manufacturing_operations more_efficient , and provide a boost to the computer-integrated-manufacturing market -- a market that yankee group , a research_firm , has said_0 may double to $_40 billion by 1993 . `` this is a step in the right direction , '' said martin piszczalski , a yankee group analyst . he_added , though , that `` a_lot of this is intentions ... . we_'ll have to wait and see '' how the plan develops . the announcements also should_help ibm go on the offensive against digital_equipment corp. on the plant floor . while ibm has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing_operations and has done well in the market for design tools , digital has dominated computerized manufacturing . hewlett-packard_co. also has_begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena . ibm will face an uphill climb against digital , given digital 's reputation for being better_than ibm at hooking together different manufacturers_' computers . in_addition , hewlett-packard , while a much_smaller player , has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give ibm some problems . both can_be expected to go after the market aggressively : gartner group_inc. , a research_firm , estimated 0 the digital gets 30_% of its revenue from the manufacturing market , and hewlett-packard gets 50_% . ibm , which gartner group said_0 generates 22_% of its revenue in this market , should_be able_to take_advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment . that is because many companies will standardize on certain types_of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge , and ibm is the biggest player . but much will depend_on how quickly ibm can move . the whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing , cim , seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past_couple of years when it became_apparent that it was n't a panacea that would make u.s. plants more_efficient and banish foreign competition . erik keller , a gartner group analyst , said_0 organizational changes may still be_required to really take_advantage of cim 's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may_not like having someone in an office using a personal_computer to look over his shoulder , for_instance , and may_be able_to prevent that from happening . but he said_0 a system such_as ibm 's should_help significantly . in making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips , for_instance , a chip sometimes does_n't melt , gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets . that can_be expensive , because the problem may_not be noticed for a while , and the sheets are typically thrown away . but mr. keller said that , if computers can_be integrated into the process , they could alert an operator as_soon as the problem occurred . they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing_to accept a lower grade of polyethylene . the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled , eliminating waste . this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies . companies might_be able_to tell salespeople daily , for_instance , about idle equipment , so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces . salespeople also could_get a precise reading on when products could_be delivered -- in much the same way that federal_express has marketed its ability_to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system .
