last_week the british displayed unusual political immaturity . the chancellor of the exchequer , nigel_lawson , resigned because prime_minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir_alan walters . the opposition labor_party leader , neil kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class , denounced mrs._thatcher for having an_independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her cabinet . the british press , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs._thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic_policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government . behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute . mr._lawson and his european-minded colleagues want the british_pound formally tied to the west_german mark . sir_alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy . as there_is an_effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to gold or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining . until his_resignation , mr._lawson had_been conducting british monetary_policy as if the pound were tied to the mark . when mrs._thatcher cut the top tax_rate to 40_% , mr._lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark . as a result , he reignited the inflation that mrs._thatcher , through a long and costly effort , had subdued . with inflation surging , the pound began falling against the mark . to_keep the exchange_rate pegged , mr._lawson tightened monetary_policy and pushed interest_rates up to 15_% . this doubled the mortgage interest_rates of the many new homeowners that mrs._thatcher 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing labor ahead in the polls . instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange_rate dominate both british economic_policy and mrs._thatcher 's political fortune , mr._lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the european_monetary system , which subordinates all member currencies to german monetary_policy . this put mrs._thatcher in a bind . the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals , the media and the imagination , but are full of practical pitfalls . if the pound had_been tied to the mark , the british would_have been unable_to cut their exorbitant tax_rates . the reason is simple . when a country cuts tax_rates , it makes itself more_attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency . it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the chirac government in france to be timid about cutting tax_rates . edouard balladur , the finance_minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would_be criticized as anti-european for disturbing the linked european currency relationship . the price of attracting capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade_deficit . to_avoid this deficit mr._lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise . this misguided policy could not prevent a british trade_deficit . consequently , mr._lawson saddled mrs._thatcher with a record trade_deficit , renewed inflation and high_interest rates -- three political failures in a row . little wonder that mrs._thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to_keep mr._lawson in office . it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought_0 it could prevent a trade_deficit by inflating the pound . the british balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax_rate was cut to 40_% , the flow abroad of british capital slowed , to 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 79 billion at the current rate -rrb- in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986 . this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account , a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency . nigel_lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has_been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s . the most_important governments have ignored the role of low tax_rates in attracting real capital investment , instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high_interest rates . this has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle . first comes monetary expansion to drive_down the currency 's value that was pushed_up by tax-rate reduction . then , when the currency falls , interest_rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange_rate . this policy is totally mindless , and sir_alan is correct to point_out its deficiencies . britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects_for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of germany . a unified germany that remained within the western alliance would_give germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified europe would become vassals of the german state . unless the soviet_union collapses , german reunification is_likely to require germany 's neutralization . the implications for britain , france and the rest of europe of having their currencies tied to the economic_policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge mr._lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate . in the least , we_must recognize the futility of trying_to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows . mr._roberts was assistant treasury_secretary under president_reagan .
