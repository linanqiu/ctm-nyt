qintex_australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los_angeles-based affiliate , qintex_entertainment inc. , filed for protection_under chapter_11 of the u.s._bankruptcy code . qintex_entertainment also said_0 david evans , its president and chief_executive , and roger kimmel , a director , both resigned . neither could_be reached for comment . earlier_this month , qintex_australia 's $_1.5 billion agreement to_acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute_over a $ 50_million letter of credit 0 the australian operator of television_stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction . mr._evans had_been the de facto head of mgm\/ua for months . qintex_entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` lonesome dove , '' said_0 it filed for chapter_11 protection after qintex_australia failed to provide it with $_5.9 million owed to mca_inc. in_connection with the distribution of `` the new leave it to beaver show . '' qintex_entertainment is 43_% owned_by qintex_australia and said_0 it relies_on the australian company for funding its working_capital requirements . after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , qintex_entertainment stock sank $_2.625 in over-the-counter_trading to close_at $_1.50 on heavy_volume of more_than 1.4_million shares . the stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer . jonathan lloyd , executive_vice president and chief_financial officer of qintex_entertainment , said_0 qintex_entertainment was forced to file for protection to_avoid going into default under its agreement_with mca . the $_5.9 million payment was due_oct. 1 and the deadline for default was oct._19 . mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have_been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements . mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` the new leave it to beaver '' as_well as other mca properties . qintex_australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation . they continued to represent that to the board , '' said mr. lloyd . ``_we were reassured 0 they would stand behind the company . '' mr. lloyd said_0 both qintex_entertainment and qintex_australia had attempted to secure a loan that would_allow the company to make the $_5.9 million payment but the request was turned_down by an unidentified lender on_oct. 14 . at that point , he said_0 , qintex_australia stated 0 it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . however a qintex_australia spokesman_said 0 his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . in a prepared statement from australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the mgm talks , it `` had_been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex_entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex_entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' the qintex_australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter_11 filing . he said_0 the company believed 0 qintex_entertainment 's financial_problems could have_been resolved by other means . the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors . `` it 's a shocker , '' said_0 joseph di lillo , chairman of drake capital securities , a brokerage_firm that has an investment in qintex_entertainment . qintex_australia was `` going_to pay more_than $_1 billion for mgm\/ua and then they could_n't come_up with the far smaller sum of $_5.9 million . '' qintex said_0 mr._evans , the former_president , resigned for `` personal_reasons '' and that mr. kimmel , an_attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no_longer necessary . mr. kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since_1980 . the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks_between qintex_australia and mgm\/ua might_be revived . it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert_murdoch 's news corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested . however , ``_we are n't currently doing anything . it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said barry diller , chairman and chief_executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp .
