the `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth . when things are quiet -lrb- low volatility -rrb- , the structures on which markets stand can_be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately . however , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival . america 's financial_markets do not_yet have all the required modern features required to make_them fully `` aftershock-resistant . '' investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information . that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity . and liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks . in today 's markets , specialists -lrb- on the new_york stock_exchange -rrb- and `` upstairs '' market_makers -lrb- in the over-the-counter_market -rrb- are the only market_participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process . when they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone . and when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -lrb- the way_0 prices are determined -rrb- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time . last_friday the 13th -lrb- as_well as two_years ago this_week -rrb- the markets became unlinked . when that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created_by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility . lack_of important , needed information can cause fear . fear is the father of panic . panic frequently results in irrational behavior . and in financial_markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated_into catastrophe . when market tremors start , it is crucial that as_much information_about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -lrb- buy and sell_orders at various prices -rrb- be made_available to all , not just to market_makers . because of a lack_of information and access , many investors --_including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they_are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . to add aftershock-damping power to america 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should_be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -lrb- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -rrb- by investors -- particularly institutional_investors . contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market_makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . what market_makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service . liquidity is not a service . it is a market attribute -- the ability_to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news . market_makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit . as a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker -lrb- which is micro-liquidity for the investor -rrb- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances 0 it was before the transaction : the unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has_changed . in fact it can_be argued_that increasing capital commitments by market_makers -lrb- a result of some post-1987 crash studies -rrb- also increases market_volatility , since the more securities are held by market_makers at any given time , the more selling_pressure is overhanging the market . in an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would_be able_to see the entire supply-demand curve -lrb- buy and sell_orders at each price -rrb- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders . current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market_participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis . investors and professionals alike would compete on the level_playing field 0 congress sought and called a `` national market system '' -lrb- not_yet achieved -rrb- almost 15_years ago when it passed the securities reform act of 1975 . last_friday 's market gyrations did_not result in severe `` aftershocks . '' were we smart or just lucky ? i_'m not certain . but i_am sure_0 we_need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation_'s markets . mr. peake is chairman of his_own consulting company in englewood , n.j .
