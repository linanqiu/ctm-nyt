japanese investment in southeast_asia is propelling the region toward economic integration . interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest_that japanese capital may produce the economic_cooperation that southeast_asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades . but japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions . the flow of japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will_be knitted together by the great japanese investment machine , ''_says 0 robert hormats , vice_chairman of goldman_sachs international corp . in the past_five years , japanese_companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ 5.57 billion . in thailand , for_example , the government 's board of investment approved $ 705.6 million of japanese investment in 1988 , 10_times the u.s. investment figure for the year . japan 's commitment in southeast_asia also_includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade . asia 's other cash-rich countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region . in taiwan and south_korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production . these nations , known_as asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to southeast_asia 's integration , but their influence will_remain subordinate to japan 's . for recipient countries such_as thailand and malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth . but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part_of this century make_them fearful of falling under japanese economic hegemony now . because of budget constraints in washington , the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region . but it resists yielding political ground . in the coming decade , analysts_say 0 , u.s.-japanese relations will_be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth . japan 's swelling investment in southeast_asia is part_of its economic evolution . in the past_decade , japanese_manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export . in the 1990s , spurred_by rising labor_costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world . to capture the investment , southeast_asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business . these nations ' internal decisions `` will_be made in a way_0 not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , ''_says 0 richard drobnick , director of the international_business and research program at the university of southern_california 's graduate_school of business . japanese money will_help turn southeast_asia into a more cohesive economic region . but , analysts_say 0 , asian cooperation is n't likely_to parallel the european common market approach . rather , japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says_0 kent calder , a specialist in east asian economies at the woodrow wilson school for public and internatonal affairs at princeton university . in electronics , for_example , a japanese company might make television picture tubes in japan , assemble the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia . `` the effect will_be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , ''_says 0 goldman_sachs 's mr. hormats . countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties . the economic and foreign ministers of 12 asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next_week to_discuss global trade issues as_well as regional matters such_as transportation and telecommunications . participants will include the u.s. , australia , canada , japan , south_korea and new_zealand as_well as the six members of the association of southeast_asian nations -- thailand , malaysia , singapore , indonesia , the philippines and brunei . in_addition , the u.s. this_year offered its_own plan for cooperation around the pacific rim in a major speech by secretary of state james_baker , following up a proposal made in january by australian prime_minister bob hawke . the baker proposal reasserts washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region . `` in asia , as in europe , a new order is taking shape , '' mr._baker said_0 . `` the u.s. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . '' but maintaining u.s. influence will_be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region . japan not_only outstrips the u.s. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most southeast_asian countries -lrb- although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia -rrb- . moreover , the japanese government , now the world 's_largest aid donor , is pumping far_more assistance into the region than the u.s. is . while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's enlarged role in asia , they also convey an undertone of caution . `` there 's an understanding on the part_of the u.s. that japan has to_expand its functions '' in asia , says_0 j. michael farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade . `` if_they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will_be a net gain for everyone . '' some asian nations are apprehensive about washington 's demand that tokyo step_up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region . the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south_korea . many asians regard a u.s. presence as a desirable counterweight to japanese influence . `` no_one wants the u.s. to pick_up its marbles and go home , '' mr. hormats says . for their part , taiwan and south_korea are_expected to step_up their_own investments in the next decade to try_to slow the japanese juggernaut . `` they do_n't want japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , ''_says chong-sik lee , professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania .
