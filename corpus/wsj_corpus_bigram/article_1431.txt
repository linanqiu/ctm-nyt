the market for $_200 billion of high-risk_junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this_year , practically vanished friday . trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential_buyers . stunned , they watched brokerage_houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able_to execute very few actual trades . `` the junk_bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there_are no bids , only offers , ''_says independent investor martin d. sass , who_manages nearly $_4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . this calamity is `` far from over , '' he_says 0 . junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the dow_jones industrial_average since the oct._19 , 1987 , crash . simultaneously , it also helped trigger this_year 's_biggest rally in the u.s. government bond_market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities 0 they could find . but `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk_market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds_of high-yield bonds despite `` no active_trading , ''_says john lonski , an_economist at moody_'s investors_service inc . for_example , the price of southland corp. 's $_500 million of 16 3\/4_% bonds_due 2002 -- sold less_than two_years ago by goldman , sachs_& co. -- plummeted 25_% to just 30 cents on the dollar . but not even goldman would make a market in the securities of southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash . goldman officials_declined to comment . junk_bonds , which mushroomed from less_than $_2 billion at the start of this decade , have_been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest_payments . the shaky market received its biggest jolt last_month from campeau_corp. , which created its u.s._retailing empire with junk financing . campeau developed a cash_squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest_payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale . now , dozens_of corporations , including ethan allen , tw services and york international , that are counting on at_least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to_keep their highly_leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat , may never get the money . `` the music has stopped playing , ''_says michael harkins , a principal in the investment firm of levy harkins . `` you_'ve either got a chair or you_do n't . '' in friday_'s aftermath , says_0 r. douglas carleton , a director of high-yield finance at first_boston corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could_be deferred , depending_on the hysteria . '' in_august , first_boston withdrew a $_475 million junk offering of ohio mattress bonds because potential_buyers were `` very skittish . '' the outlook `` looks shaky because we_'re still waiting '' for mutual_funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk_bond holdings to pay_off redemptions by individual_investors , says_0 king penniman , senior_vice president at mccarthy , crisanti & maffei , an investment arm of xerox financial_services . indeed , a moody_'s index that tracks the net_asset values of 24 high-yield mutual_funds declined for the 17th consecutive day friday . in a stark contrast , the benchmark_30-year treasury_bond climbed more_than 2_1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $_1,000 face_amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year . the bond 's yield dropped to 7.82_% , the lowest_since march_31 , 1987 , according_to technical data global markets group . the yield on three-month_treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage_point to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . the main catalyst for government bond_market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average . `` when_you get panic in one market , you_get flight to quality in the other , '' said maria ramirez , money market economist_at drexel_burnham lambert_inc . nevertheless , the problems of the junk_market could prompt the federal_reserve to ease_credit in the months_ahead . `` this marks a significant shift in the interest_rate outlook , ''_says william sullivan , director of money market research at dean_witter reynolds_inc. , new_york . any sustained credit-easing could_be a lift for junk_bonds as_well as other securities . robert dow , a partner and portfolio_manager at lord , abbett &_co. , which manages $_4 billion of high-yield bonds , says_0 he does_n't `` think_0 there_is any fundamental economic rationale -lcb- for the junk_bond rout -rcb- . it was herd instinct . '' he_adds : `` the junk_market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means 0 the economy will_be terrible and that 's bad for junk . i_do n't_believe 0 that 's the case , but i_believe that people are running scared . there_is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in treasurys . '' even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more_than $_2 billion of new junk_bonds . for_example , a recent $ 375 million offering of petrolane gas services l.p. bonds sold by first_boston was three_times oversubscribed . a $_550 million offering of turner_broadcasting system inc . high-yield securities sold last_week by drexel was increased $ 50_million because of strong_demand . first_boston estimates that in november and december alone , junk_bond investors will_receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest_payments . `` that 's a clear indication that there_is and will_be an undercurrent of basic business going on , ''_says mr. carleton of first_boston . ``_i do_n't know_how people can say_0 the junk_bond market disappeared when there_were $_1.5 billion of orders for $_550 million of junk_bonds sold last_week by turner , ''_says raymond minella , co-head of merchant_banking at merrill_lynch &_co . `` when the rally comes , insurance_companies will_be leading it because_they have billions 0 to invest and invest they will . there_is plenty_of money available from people_who want to buy well-structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of . '' but such highly_leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this_year , casting a pall_over much of the junk_market . michael mcnamara , director of fixed-income research at kemper_financial services , says_0 the quality of junk issues has_been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices . `` last_year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he_says . `` this_year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . and our credit standards have n't changed one iota . '' however , mr. mcnamara said_0 the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying_opportunity '' for selective buyers . for the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . `` the market has_been weak since '' the announcement of the campeau cash_squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia_& york , says mr. minella of merrill_lynch . `` that really affected the market in that people started to ask ` what else is in trouble ? ' '' well before campeau , though , there_were signs that the junk_market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever . despite the relatively strong economy , junk_bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad_news : -- in june , two_months before it would default on interest_payments covering some of its $_1.2 billion of speculative debt_securities , new_york-based integrated_resources inc. said_0 it ran out of borrowed_money . -- in july , southmark corp. , the dallas-based real_estate and financial_services company with about $_1.3 billion of junk_bonds , voluntarily filed for protection_under u.s._bankruptcy law . -- by the end of july , the difference in yield between an index of junk_bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more_than 5.5 percentage_points . -- in_august , resorts international_inc. , which sold more_than $_500 million of junk_bonds , suspended interest_payments . -- in_september , just as the cash_squeeze hit campeau , lomas financial_corp. defaulted on $_145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $_1.2 billion of debt_securities . meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no_signs of abating . moody_'s says_0 the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this_year since 1982 . in_addition , there_are six times as many troubled banks as there_were in the recession of 1981 , according_to the federal_deposit insurance corp . `` the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , ''_says james grant , editor of grant 's interest_rate observer , an early critic of the junk_bond market . `` what we_'ve begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest . businesses were borrowing at interest_rates higher_than their_own earnings . what we_'re seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset_values to a future when speculative-grade debt will_be hard to_obtain rather_than easy . '' friday_'s market_activity prices of treasury_bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock_market . the benchmark_30-year treasury_bond was_quoted 6 p.m._edt at 103 12\/32 , compared_with 100 27\/32 thursday , up 2_1\/2 points . the yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82_% , the lowest_since march_31 , 1987 , according_to technical data global markets group . the `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock_market . treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer_price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in_september . bond_prices barely budged until midday . many bond_market participants will_be closely eying the action of the federal_reserve , which might repeat its october_1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial_markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their treasury counterparts . mortgage_securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in government national_mortgage association 9_% coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . the ginnie_mae november 9_% issue ended at_98 25\/32 , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12-year_average life_assumption . investment-grade_corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . but the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened . and the yields_on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade_bonds in_anticipation of this_week 's $_3 billion bond_offering by the tennessee_valley authority . despite rumors_that the tva 's long-awaited offering would_be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said_0 they_expect 0 the issue will_be priced as scheduled . one of the sources_said 0 the smaller portions of $_750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . '' municipal_bonds rose as_much as 3\/4 point . roger lowenstein contributed_to this_article .
