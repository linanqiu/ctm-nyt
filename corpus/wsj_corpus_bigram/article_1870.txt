`` the cosby show '' may_have single-handedly turned around ratings at nbc since its debut in 1984 , and the huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing thursday night on the network . but some of the tv_stations that bought `` cosby '' reruns for record prices two_years ago are n't laughing much these_days . the reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent tv_stations that air the shows . but the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say_0 they may_not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire . meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say_0 , the show 's distributor , viacom inc. , is giving an ultimatum : either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` cosby '' to a competitor . at the same_time , viacom is trying_to persuade stations to make commitments to `` a different world , '' a spin-off of `` cosby '' whose reruns will_become available in 1991 . viacom denies 0 it 's using pressure tactics . ``_we 're willing_to negotiate , ''_says dennis gillespie , executive_vice president of marketing . ``_we 're offering this plan now because we feel 0 it 's the right time . '' but , says_0 the general_manager of a network affiliate in the midwest , ``_i think_0 if i tell_them 0 i need more time , they_'ll take ` cosby ' across the street , '' viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks . one station manager says_0 he_believes 0 viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` cosby '' ratings will_continue to drop in syndication over the next_few years . `` cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of oct. 2-8 over the same week a year_ago , according_to a.c._nielsen co . mr. gillespie at viacom says_0 the ratings are rising . and executives at stations in such major markets as washington ; providence , r.i. ; cleveland ; raleigh , n.c. ; minneapolis , and louisville , ky. , say_0 they may very_well not renew `` cosby . '' dick lobo , the general_manager of wtvj , the nbc-owned station in miami , for_example , says_0 the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . '' `` at the prices 0 we were_charged , there should have_been some return for the dollar . there was n't . '' neil kuvin , the general_manager of whas , the cbs affiliate in louisville , says_0 `` cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and 0 he 's `` pleased . '' but he_adds , ``_i feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with viacom .
