ual_corp. 's board quashed any prospects_for an immediate revival of a labor-management_buy-out , saying_0 united_airlines ' parent should remain_independent for now . as a result , ual 's chairman , stephen m. wolf , pulled_out of the buy-out_effort to focus_on running the company . the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an_array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor_situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility . the effort to create the nation_'s largest employee-owned company began unraveling oct._13 when the labor-management_group was_unable to_obtain financing for its $_300-a-share , $_6.79 billion offer . just last_week it suffered another major setback when british_airways plc , the largest equity investor in the labor-management_bid , withdrew its support . takeover_stock traders , focusing_on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad_news . ual , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m._edt announcement . among the first trades reported by the securities_firm of jefferies &_co. , which_makes a market in ual after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $_170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . the rebound in ual_stock during regular trading hours monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before oct._13 , the day 0 the group announced 0 the bank_financing could_n't be obtained for the original deal . twelve of ual 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out_group for a revised_bid . but the board said_0 it was n't interested for now . that proposal , valued_at between $_225 and $_240 a_share , would_have transferred majority_ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands . the buy-out_group had no firm financing for the plan . and , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it . the directors signaled , however , that they would_be willing_to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder_value , saying_0 they would_continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . '' but it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy . the board said_0 it concluded_that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of ual as a strong , viable , independent company . '' mr._wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline . he also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture ... a constructive new relationship that has_been forged with participating employee groups . '' but mr._wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again . labor problems top the list . for a brief time , the buy-out_effort seemed to solve his problems with united 's pilot_union . in return for an ownership stake_in the company , the pilots were_willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains 0 the union previously resisted . that contract was tied to the success of the buy-out . as a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had_been working four extra hours a month and had agreed_to fly ual 's two new boeing 747-400 aircraft . it 's uncertain if the pilots will_continue to do_so without a contract settlement . the union said late_last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out_effort `` still need to be addressed . '' the buy-out_effort also worsened already-strained relations_between united 's pilot and machinist unions . the machinists_' criticisms of the labor-management_bid and their threats of a strike unless_they received substantial wage_increases this_year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction . the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to mr._wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot_union . the machinists criticized the terms 0 mr._wolf and management received in the buy-out . they paid $ 15 million for a 1 %_stake and received an_additional 9_% of the company at no additional cost . his credibility is also on the line in the investment community . until the collapse of this bid , mr._wolf was regarded_as one of the nation_'s savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of tiger international_inc. and republic airlines . but he and his chief_financial officer , john pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting 0 banks accept low financing fees and interest_rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million 0 they stood to gain from sale of their ual_stock and options . the board 's actions leave takeover_stock traders nursing some $_700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone_who might make a new offer . it also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits . arbitragers said_0 they_were disappointed 0 the company did_n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value . one takeover expert noted_that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote . the machinists_union has suggested 0 it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special_dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees . los_angeles investor_marvin davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for ual in_august triggered a bidding_war , says_0 he remains interested_in the airline . however , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an_agreement 0 he signed to_obtain confidential ual data . essentially , he ca_n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender_offer at_least $_300 a_share .
