david baltimore , who has just been named_president of rockefeller university , already knows what it 's like to go through life with `` nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . he is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his_name . the nobel committee made the first addition ; john_dingell 's congressional committee created the second . both of dr._baltimore 's public faces have_been on view the past_few weeks while he was under_consideration to succeed joshua lederberg as head of the prestigious rockefeller research institution . it came to light that a substantial number_of rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to dr._baltimore 's impending appointment . they_were disturbed at what they regarded_as dr._baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute_over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with dr._baltimore . readers of these columns -lrb- `` the science police , '' may 15 -rrb- will recall that dr._baltimore was merely the most well-known part_of the dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched mit , tufts , duke , the national_institutes of health and elsewhere . rep. dingell even managed to enlist the services of the secret service in his investigation of the baltimore paper . insofar as mr. dingell has a special interest in nih and the institutions that receive its funding , the rockefeller scientists were no_doubt discomfited by dr._baltimore 's unflattering public_opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded dr._baltimore of the mccarthy era . this well may_be the first_time that the venerable rockefeller university has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in american science . john_dingell demagogues a david baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5_million of damage to labs at the u.cal-davis , meryl streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , jeremy rifkin files lawsuits in federal_court to thwart biotech experiments , and dutch-elm-disease researcher gary strobel 's own colleagues at montana state denounce him for `` violating '' epa rules . scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this_country is n't their concern or that a david baltimore could have somehow placated a john_dingell . -lrb- mr. dingell , by the way , has decreed another nih investigation of the baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations . something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here . -rrb- fortunately , there_are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out . david hubel , a nobel laureate at_harvard , has_taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has dr. michael debakey . nasa defended itself vigorously and successfully against a rifkin suit 0 to block the galileo launch . scientists need to understand that while they tend_to believe_0 their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power . in a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people_who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work . when a david baltimore -- or the next target -- decides 0 it is better to stand up to these forces , his_fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
