and you thought_0 the only reason 0 to save your canceled checks was to prepare_for an irs audit . reggie jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . mr._jackson , who won the nickname `` mr. october '' for his world_series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as_much as $_500 each . dealers_say 0 the budding trade in mr._jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . ``_i do_n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , ''_says jack smalling , a dealer in ames , iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . an_initial batch of mr._jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in san_francisco over labor day weekend . mr._jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as_well . `` for someone who has everything_else -- reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might_be a nice addition , ''_says william vizas , owner of bill 's sports collectibles in denver , who examined the checks at the san_francisco card show . for years , the canceled checks of a small number_of well-known baseball players have_been bought and sold . but these players were dead . `` maybe three_years ago , there_were a_lot of -lcb- ty -rcb- cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there_were babe ruth checks , ''_says mr. smalling . however , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . `` maybe i_'m a little stuffy , but i would n't sell them , '' sniffs bob machon , owner of papa 's sports cards in menlo_park , calif . `` who knows_how much they_'ll be worth 100 years from now ? '' and mr. smalling does_n't believe_0 they_'re worth all that much now . ``_i do_n't think_0 the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he_says . why mr._jackson , who could_n't be_reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . he probably has n't done it for the cash . ``_i would say_0 he 's definitely not in need of money , ''_says matt merola , an agent of mr._jackson 's based in new_york . `` he has good investments . '' and mr._jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too . or at_least he should . ``_i assume 0 those accounts are closed , ''_says mr. smalling , referring_to the accounts of the canceled checks . ``_i do_n't think_0 he 'd want to give out his current_account numbers .
