call it the ``_we 're too broke to fight '' defense . lawyers for dozens_of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors . the thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in texas alone , should_be dismissed as moot because neither the s&ls nor the extinct federal_savings and loan insurance corp. has the money 0 to pay judgments . though the argument may_have a common-sense ring to it , even the s&l lawyers concede 0 there 's little precedent 0 to back their position . still , one federal_appeals court has signaled 0 it 's willing_to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other_states where the defense is permitted under state law . the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long_way toward clearing court dockets in texas and reducing the fslic 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last_year . the s&l lawyers were encouraged last_month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought_against defunct sunbelt savings_& loan_association of dallas by the developers of the valley ranch , best_known as the training center for the dallas cowboys football team . sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch . sunbelt and the fslic argued to the fifth u.s. circuit_court of appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against sunbelt savings nor any means 0 to collect from any other party , including fslic . '' `` if true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . '' but the court said_0 it lacked enough financial information_about sunbelt and the fslic and sent the cases back to federal_district court in dallas . charles haworth , a lawyer for sunbelt , says_0 he plans to file a brief this_week urging the district_judge to dismiss the suits , because sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $_2 billion when federal_regulators closed it in_august 1988 . `` this institution is just brain dead , ''_says mr. haworth , a partner in the dallas office of andrews & kurth , a houston law_firm . but a lawyer for triland investment group , the developer of valley ranch , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour . '' attorney richard jackson of dallas says_0 a judgment for triland could_be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of sunbelt 's foreclosure on valley ranch . ``_we 're asking the court for a number_of things 0 he can grant in_addition to the thrill of victory , '' he_says 0 . ``_we 'd take the valley ranch free and clear as a booby prize .
