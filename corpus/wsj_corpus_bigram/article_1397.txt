do_n't jump yet . the stock_market 's swoon may turn_out to be good_news for the economy . in one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the bush_administration has_been trying_to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks . it is forcing the federal_reserve to ease its grip_on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar . the resulting decline in interest_rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate american business -- indeed , the entire economy . this may sound strangely optimistic . after all , until a few_years ago , the stock_market was viewed_as a barometer of the national economy . when it went_down , by all tradition , the economy followed . that has_changed , partly_because the two_years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have_been reasonably comfortable . the 1987_crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , ''_says 0 university of chicago economist victor zarnowitz . the market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation . its spasms ca_n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy . `` the market today has a life of its_own , '' john akers , chairman of international_business machines_corp. , said saturday . `` there 's nothing rational about this_kind of action . '' of course , the health of the economy will_be threatened if the market continues to dive this_week . sharply falling stock_prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign_investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial sustenance . the financial-services industry was battered by the 1987_crash . what 's more , although the stock_market is far_less overvalued today than two_years ago , the u.s._economy is weaker . growth is slower . profits are softer . debt burdens are heavier . but if the stock_market does_n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower_interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . the fed , which until friday had_been resisting moves 0 to ease_credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . fed officials may protest that this does_n't necessarily_mean a fundamental_change in their interest-rate policies . but the experience of the 1987_crash suggests 0 the fed is_likely to bring down short-term_interest rates in its effort to calm markets . anticipating the fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest_rate known_as the federal_funds rate to 8.625 % late_friday , down from 8.820 % the day before . tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each_other for_overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets . the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock_market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the u.s. . treasury officials have_been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several_years . the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign_investors that the treasury was right about the overpriced dollar . a modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would_be welcomed by the u.s. . that was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some_economists and government_officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign_investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the u.s. . another big difference_between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting . in the third_quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an_inflation-adjusted annual_rate of 5.3_% . the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third_quarter of 1989 , which ended two_weeks ago . the plunge in stock_prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , ''_says 0 economist lawrence chimerine of wefa group , a bala cynwyd , pa. , forecasting company . `` a_lot of pent-up demand is gone . '' consumer_spending did drop in the months following black_monday 1987 -- `` but only_slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls 0 mr. zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles . `` that was offset_by strength elsewhere . -lcb- the effects -rcb- were much_less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected 0 . '' today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may_be insufficient to pick_up the slack if stock_prices sink this_week and if consumers retrench in reaction . what 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past_two years . ``_we 've_had two more years of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are_being squeezed , '' mr. chimerine notes . the more a company relies_on borrowed_money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic_slowdown . a company with a strong balance_sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly_leveraged company may end_up in bankruptcy_court . the fed , of course , knows that very_well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this_morning . but , in the process , the fed risks reigniting inflation . even_before friday_'s events , harvard university economist benjamin friedman was arguing_that the fed wo_n't be_able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to_protect fragile financial_markets , banks and highly_leveraged corporations . the biggest threat on the economic horizon right_now is n't recession , he reasons 0 ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation . in the end , the 1987 collapse suggested 0 , the economy does_n't move in lockstep with stock_prices . the economy does , however , depend_on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign_investors . a panic on_wall street does_n't exactly inspire confidence . surveys suggested_that consumer confidence was high before friday . a 190-point_drop is n't likely_to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will . if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs , va. , for the business council meetings are typical , business_leaders were n't overly rattled by friday_'s decline . and if foreign_investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests_that the u.s. can stand it . on the bottom_line , the most comforting fact for the economic_outlook is that we_'ve been through this before . two_years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent depression . the doomsayers had a receptive audience . the prosperity that followed black_monday permits a more optimistic view today . at the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation_'s success in handling the last go-around . as sen. lloyd_bentsen -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- observed yesterday , `` the fed avoided a meltdown last time . they_are more_sophisticated this time .
