dale lang , who this_week completed the acquisition of the publisher of ms. and sassy , is candid about the challenge 0 he is taking on . mr._lang admits that ms. is `` in dire straits '' and that sassy needs big promotional dollars 0 to_keep it alive . but the 57-year-old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal_with the magazines ' problems . last_friday , he told the staff of ms. that the magazine in january would begin publishing without advertising . mr._lang will do away with expensive circulation drives , not to mention sales staff , and attempt_to publish the 17-year-old magazine supported_by circulation revenue alone . `` any fool can publish a money-losing magazine . i want to publish one that succeeds , '' said mr._lang . `` for ms. , it 's time 0 to publish for the reader , not the advertiser . '' as for sassy , which competes directly with news corp. 's seventeen magazine , mr._lang says that in the next two_years he will spend $_6 million promoting and improving the magazine . though sassy has_grown quickly since its debut in march 1988 , it has_been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems . mr._lang said_0 the former australian owners of sassy were `` blind-sided by the moral majority ... . their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out . '' he said_0 sassy will keep its irreverent tone , but added , ``_we will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine . '' sassy already_has recovered ; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this_year at more_than 300 . what 's more , mr._lang says_0 he has what all publishers wish for : a bona fide niche . `` seventeen is written more for mothers , not their daughters , '' said mr._lang . `` but sassy has a different spirit . it gets more mail in a month than mccall 's got in a year , and it 's not from mothers . i_feel about sassy like i did about working_woman 10_years ago . '' mr._lang took on ms. and sassy with the acquisition of matilda publications_inc. by his newly_formed lang communications . lang owns 70_% of matilda , while citicorp owns the rest through its citicorp venture_capital partners . two_weeks ago , citicorp and mr._lang pumped $ 800,000 into matilda just to_keep the doors open . industry_observers have congratulated mr._lang on what some call his `` courageous '' handling of ms. , but his track_record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews . besides ms. and sassy , closely_held lang communications includes success , a magazine for entrepreneurs and small_businesses , and working_woman and working_mother , two monthly magazines . working_woman , with circulation near one million , and working_mother , with 625,000 circulation , are legitimate magazine success stories . the magazine success , however , was for years lackluster and unfocused . only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved . success is_expected to gain at_least because of the recent folding of rival venture , another magazine for growing companies . working_woman and working_mother have operated as_part of working woman\/mccall 's group , a less-than-successful joint_venture between mr._lang and time_warner inc . the joint_venture is being undone , with mccall 's magazine being_sold last_summer to the new_york times co. 's magazine group for about $ 80_million , and time_warner agreeing to sell back its 50_% interest in working_woman and working_mother to mr._lang . executives at time inc . magazine co. , a subsidiary of time_warner , have said_0 the joint_venture with mr._lang was n't a good one . the venture , formed in 1986 , was supposed_to be time 's low-cost , safe entry_into women 's magazines . mr._lang surprised time soon_after joining forces when he said_0 he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers , a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers . in_addition , mccall 's put in a less_than stellar performance . until a recent comeback , it saw steep losses in ad_pages and circulation . time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality , and in the end , one time executive who asked_not to be_identified said , `` frankly , mccall 's and the joint_venture were an embarrassment . '' mr._lang feels that time 's priorities changed . `` their management changed right after -lcb- the venture was formed -rcb- , and i_do n't_think 0 they_were comfortable getting_into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines . '' today , mr._lang believes_0 his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do_n't . ``_we write straight for women on their level , '' he said . ``_we do_n't have passive readers . '' mr._lang points out that even success , in part , fits the company 's image , since about 30_% of its readership is female . mr._lang has named carol taber , 43 , as group publisher of new_york-based lang communications . she will oversee working_woman , working_mother and success magazines , and retain her post as publisher of working_woman . the sale price of mccall 's -- twice what mr._lang originally paid for it -- will finance lang communications ' buy-back of time_warner 's 50_% interest in working_woman and working_mother . mr._lang says_0 he is n't scouting new acquisitions , at_least for now . ``_we would_have to go outside to banks to get the money and i_am not ready to do that , '' he said . `` besides , we have enough on our plate . there_is plenty_of work 0 to be_done on what we have .
