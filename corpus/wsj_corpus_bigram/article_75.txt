when the trinity repertory theater named anne bogart its artistic director last_spring , the nation_'s theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow . ms._bogart , an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as rodgers and hammerstein 's `` south pacific , '' is decidedly downtown . trinity rep meanwhile is one of the nation_'s oldest and most respected regional theaters , still hosting an annual `` a christmas carol . '' how would this bastion of traditional values fare in ms._bogart 's iconoclastic hands ? she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier_this season . it was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-broadway anthology of bertolt brecht 's theoretical writings , called `` no plays , no poetry . '' now , with the opening of maxim gorky 's bourgeois-bashing `` summerfolk , '' ms._bogart has laid her cards on the table . hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences . for ms._bogart , who initially studied and directed in germany -lrb- and cites such european directors as peter stein , giorgio strehler and ariane mnouchkine as influences -rrb- tends_to stage her productions with a brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not . and gorky , considered the father of soviet socialist realism , did_not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques . gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of chekhovian humanism . and `` summerfolk , '' penned in 1904 as a kind_of sequel to chekhov 's `` cherry orchard , '' is a lawn party of russian yuppies engaged_in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers . along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances . wisely ms._bogart has kept gorky 's time and place intact . despite the absence of samovars -lrb- and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down -rrb- , the production is rich in russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton , with boaters and fishing poles aplenty . but beyond this decorative nod to tradition , ms._bogart and company head_off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms gorky 's naturalistic drama into something akin to , well , farce . the director 's attempt_to force some brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered . not_only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear 0 they_are at_odds with them , but they often literally stand on their heads . like peter sellars , ms._bogart manipulates her actors as if_they were rag dolls , sprawling them on staircases , dangling them off tables , even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do . there_are moments in this `` summerfolk '' when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house -lrb- which looks_like a parody of frank lloyd wright and is designed by victoria petrovich -rrb- spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of `` laugh in . '' `` talk hurts from where it spurts , '' one of them says . the clash of ideologies survives this treatment , but the nuance and richness of gorky 's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle . as for the humor that gorky 's text provides , when repainted in such broad strokes -lrb- particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble -rrb- it looks and sounds forced . ms._bogart does better with music than with words when she_wants , as she so often does want , to express herself through gorky 's helpless play . here she has the aid of her longtime associate jeff helpern , whom she appointed trinity 's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $ 60,000 sound system and recording studio . for gorky , mr. helpern provided an aural collage of debussy and rachmaninoff , which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view . like brecht , and indeed ezra pound , ms._bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an_attempt to `` make it new . '' indeed , during a recent post-production audience discussion , the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way_0 to play `` somewhere over the rainbow '' so that the song 's `` original beauty comes through , '' surmounting the cliche . the danger that ms._bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather_than rejuvenation , a vision so at_odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view nullify , rather_than illuminate , each_other . ms._bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem . ed shea and barbara orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish , idealistic young vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor maria lvovna . cynthia strickland as the long-suffering varvara is a tiresome whiner , not the inspirational counterrevolutionary 0 gorky intended . better to look in the corners for performances that inspire or amuse . janice duclos , in_addition to possessing one of the evening 's more impressive vocal instruments , brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of olga , everybody 's favorite mom . marni rice plays the maid with so_much edge as to steal her two scenes . but it is the trinity rep newcomer , jonathan fried -lrb- zamislov , the paralegal -rrb- who is the actor 0 to watch , whether he is hamming it up while conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor 's wife -lrb- becca lish -rrb- by licking her bosom . ms. de vries writes frequently about theater .
