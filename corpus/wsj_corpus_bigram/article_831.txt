whose della_femina mcnamee wcrs agency_created liar joe isuzu , among_others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to paris-based eurocom . the complex restructuring , which was long expected , transforms london-based wcrs from primarily a creator of advertising into one of europe 's_largest buyers of advertising time and space . it also creates a newly merged world-wide ad_agency controlled_by eurocom and headed jointly by new_york ad man jerry della_femina and two top wcrs executives . the merged agency 's admittedly ambitious goal : to become one of the world 's 10 largest agencies , while attracting more multinational clients than 0 the agencies were able_to attract alone . wcrs 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in europe , where the only way_0 to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk . for eurocom , meanwhile , the move gives it a strong u.s. foothold in della_femina , and more_than quadruples the size of its ad_agency business world-wide . it also gives the outspoken mr. della_femina -- who often generates as_much publicity for himself as for his clients -- an international platform that he most certainly wo_n't be loath to use . according_to terms , wcrs will pay 2.02 billion french_francs -lrb- $ 318.6 million -rrb- for the 50_% 0 it_does n't already_own of carat holding s.a. , one of europe 's_largest media buyers . meanwhile , eurocom , which had held 20_% of wcrs 's ad unit , will pay # 43.5 million -lrb- $ 68.5 million -rrb- to raise its stake to 60_% . that price also covers eurocom raising to 60_% its 51_% stake_in europe 's belier group , a joint_venture ad_agency network 0 it owns with wcrs . eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40_% of the merged ad_agency group in six_years . the transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of eurocom wcrs della_femina ball ltd. , or ewdb . the merged agency will include della_femina mcnamee based in new_york , eurocom 's various agencies in france , the belier group in europe and wcrs 's other advertising and direct_marketing operations . mr. della_femina will_be joint chairman with former wcrs executive robin wight . both will report to tim breene , a former wcrs executive who will_be chief_executive officer at the new agency . in an_interview in new_york , mr. breene , fresh from a concorde flight from paris where executives had worked through most of the night , outlined big plans for the new agency . `` our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position ... by the end of three_years from now . it implies very dramatic growth , '' he said . he_added that eurocom and wcrs had agreed_to provide a development fund of # 100_million for acquisitions . the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in spain , while mr. breene said_0 it also plans to make acquisitions in scandinavia , germany and elsewhere . cracking the top_10 within three_years will_be difficult at best . della_femina had billings of just $ 660 million last_year and ranked as the u.s. 's 24th-largest ad_agency . the merged company that it now becomes part_of will have billings of just more_than $ 2.6_billion -- most of that in europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide . to make it to top-10 status , it would_have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as grey advertising , d'arcy masius benton & bowles and omnicom 's ddb_needham . the merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may_prove equally difficult . when wcrs created della_femina mcnamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 , it said_0 it did so in order to attract larger clients , especially packaged-goods companies . since_then , della_femina won pan_am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients , including dow_chemical co. 's saran wrap . but major packaged-goods players of the world -- such_as procter_& gamble , colgate-palmolive and unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency . `` three of our favorite names , '' mr. della_femina calls that roster , adding hopefully , ``_we 're a much more_attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday . '' still , the restructuring could create one of the most_powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that europe has seen . as_part of the restructuring , wcrs and eurocom said_0 they will look for ways_0 to combine their media buying across_europe . what 's more , both eurocom and brothers francis and gilbert gross , who founded carat , will acquire 14.99 % stakes in wcrs group , creating a powerful link_between eurocom and carat . carat will_receive its wcrs stake as_part of payment for the 50_% carat stake that wcrs is buying , while eurocom said_0 it_expects to pay about # 32_million for its wcrs stake . mr. della_femina says_0 he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency , serving as a sort of `` creative conscience . '' louise mcnamee , della_femina 's president , will_continue running the u.s. agency day-to-day . they and other top_executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della_femina will_receive an_additional multimillion-dollar sum , which some industry_executives pegged at about $ 10 million . wcrs group , for its part , will now be_able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming `` a holding_company for a series of media-related businesses , '' said_0 peter scott , the firm 's chief_executive . in_addition to carat , wcrs will hold onto its public_relations , tv programming and other businesses . wcrs says_0 its debt will_be cut to # 24 million from # 66 million as a result of the transaction . for carat , meanwhile , the alliance_with eurocom and wcrs is intended_to strengthen its_own push outside france . carat 's gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space . by buying the space in bulk , they obtain discounts as high as 50_% , which they_can pass on to customers . they thus have won the french space-buying business of such advertising giants as coca-cola_co. , fiat s.p . a. , gillette and kodak . but now , other agencies are getting_into the business with their_own competing media-buying groups -- and carat wants to_expand to the rest of europe . to help_finance the carat purchase , wcrs said_0 it plans an issue of euroconvertible preferred_shares once the market settles down . but wcrs added that `` in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets , '' it has arranged medium-term debt financing , which would_be underwritten_by samuel montagu &_co. ltd . earthquake 's damage tuesday 's earthquake brought the san_francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday , with only a few staffers showing up at their offices , mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations . while no agencies reported injuries to employees , the quake damaged the offices of j._walter thompson , chiat\/day\/mojo and ddb_needham , among_others , spokesmen for those agencies said_0 . staffers at thompson , whose offices are in the ultramodern embarcadero center , watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet , according_to a spokeswoman . plaster fell and windows were broken at chiat\/day\/mojo , a spokesman for that agency said_0 . late_yesterday afternoon , ddb_needham executives were scrambling to figure_out what to do about a new business presentation that had_been scheduled for today , a spokesman_said 0 . ddb_needham 's office building may_have sustained structural_damage , the spokesman added 0 . `` all operations have stopped , '' he said . a number_of agencies , including thompson and foote , cone & belding , said_0 some employees who live outside of san_francisco , fearful that they would n't be_able to get home , spent the night at the agency . ad_notes ... . new account : chesebrough-pond 's inc. , greenwich , conn. , awarded its faberge hair care accounts to j._walter thompson , new_york . thompson , a unit of wpp_group , will handle faberge organic shampoo and conditioner and aqua net hairspray . the accounts , which billed about $ 7 million last_year , according_to leading national advertisers , were previously handled at bozell , new_york . who 's news : william morrissey , 44 , was_named executive_vice president , world-wide director of mccann direct , the direct_marketing unit of interpublic_group 's mccann-erickson agency . he had_been president and chief_operating officer of ogilvy_& mather direct . bozell : los_angeles will_be the site of a new entertainment division for the ad_agency . the division will_be headed_by dick porter , who returns to bozell after being vice_president of media at mgm . ac&r advertising : the agency 's three california offices , previously called ac&r\/ccl advertising , will now be called ac&r advertising to match the name of its new_york office . ac&r advertising is a unit of saatchi_& saatchi co . new beer : sibra products inc. , greenwich , conn. , awarded its cardinal amber light beer account to heidelberg &_associates , new_york . budget is set at $_1.5 million . the new beer , introduced this_week at a liquor industry convention , is imported from switzerland 's cardinal brewery . heidelberg 's first ads for the brand , which sibra says_0 will compete_with imported light beer leader amstel light , feature the line `` the best tasting light beer 0 you_'ve ever seen .
