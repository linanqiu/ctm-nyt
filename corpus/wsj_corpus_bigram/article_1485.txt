'' the move also would_allow the company to concentrate_on core_businesses , which include ceramic tile , floor coverings and furniture . moreover , such a sale could help armstrong reassure its investors and deter the belzbergs , who own a 9.85 %_stake in the lancaster , pa. , company . analysts_expect armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy_back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition . the carpet division had 1988 sales of $ 368.3 million , or almost 14_% of armstrong 's $ 2.68 billion total revenue . the company has_been manufacturing carpet since 1967 . recently it upgraded its plants so that it could make stain-resistant products with higher quality dyes . for the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating_profit margins have hovered around 5_% , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared_with the 13_% to 19_% margins for two of armstrong 's chief businesses , flooring and building_products . analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to armstrong and shaw , the market leader in the u.s. carpet industry , with an_estimated 17_% to 20_% share . shaw , based in dalton , ga. , has annual_sales of about $_1.18 billion , and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are_expected to boost the profitability of armstrong 's brands , sold under the armstrong and evans-black names . yesterday , in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange , shaw 's shares_closed ex-dividend at $ 26.125 , up $_2.25 . armstrong 's shares , also listed on the big_board , closed_at $ 39.125 , up_12.5 cents . yesterday , armstrong reported flat earnings for the third_quarter and nine_months , worsened by the stock dilution of an employee_stock ownership plan adopted earlier_this year . for the quarter , earnings were $ 47 million , or 92 cents_a share , including a one-time_gain of $_5.9 million . in the year-ago_quarter , earnings were $ 42.9 million , or 93 cents_a share . yesterday , armstrong announced an_agreement to sell its small applied color_systems unit to a subsidiary of the swiss company , brauerei eichof ltd . the price was n't_disclosed . armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late_november and the carpet sale in december , with the gains to be applied to fourth_quarter or first-quarter results .
