the chemical industry is_expected to report that profits eroded in the third_quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business . producers of commodity_chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers . once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will_be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988_third quarter . `` for some of these companies , this will_be the first_quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons , ''_says leonard bogner , a chemical industry_analyst at prudential bache research . `` this could_be the first of five or six down quarters . '' perhaps most_prominent , dow_chemical co. , which as of midyear had racked_up eight consecutive record quarters , is_expected to report that profit decreased in the latest_quarter from a year_earlier , if only by a shade . though dow has aggressively diversified into specialty_chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake_in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and housewares . analysts_' third-quarter estimates for the midland , mich. , company are between $ 3.20 a_share and $ 3.30 a_share , compared_with $ 3.36 a year_ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion . a dow spokeswoman declined to comment_on the estimates . at the investment firm of smith_barney , harris_upham &_co. , the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8_% to 10_% . `` you will find the commodities off more_than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , ''_says james wilbur , a smith_barney analyst . first_boston corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies 0 it follows will report lower profit . most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations . still , some industry giants are_expected to report continuing gains , largely_because so_much of their business is outside commodity_chemicals . du_pont co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments , fibers and polymers . moreover , the wilmington , del. , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity_chemicals 0 it buys for its_own production needs , such_as ethylene . analysts are divided over whether du_pont will report much of a gain in the latest_quarter from its conoco inc. oil company . the estimates for du_pont range from $_2.25 to $ 2.45 a_share . in the 1988_third quarter , the company_earned $ 461 million , or $ 1.91 a_share , on sales of $ 7.99 billion . du_pont declined to comment . monsanto co. , too , is_expected to continue reporting higher profit , even_though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest_quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s. . the st. louis-based company is_expected to report again that losses in its g.d. searle &_co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing . searle continued to operate in the red through the first_half of the year , but monsanto has said_0 it_expects searle to post a profit for all of 1989 . most estimates for monsanto run between $ 1.70 and $_2 a_share . a year_ago , the company posted third-quarter_profit of $ 116 million , or $ 1.67 a_share , on sales of $ 2.02 billion . monsanto declined to comment . but the commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle . by some accounts on_wall street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand . but doubters say_0 growing production_capacity could keep pressure_on prices into the early 1990s . in the latest_quarter , at_least , profit is_expected to fall sharply . for himont inc. , `` how far down it is , we_do n't_know , ''_says leslie ravitz at salomon_brothers . the projections are in the neighborhood of 50_cents a_share to 75_cents , compared_with a restated $_1.65 a_share a year_earlier , when profit was $ 107.8 million on sales of $ 435.5 million . himont faces lower_prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program 0 to bolster its raw_material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . the company , based in wilmington , del. , is 81%-owned by montedison s.p . a. , milan , which has an offer outstanding for the himont shares 0 it_does n't already_own . at quantum chemical corp. , new_york , the trouble is lower_prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the idling of an_important plant due to an_explosion . some_analysts hedge their estimates for quantum , because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges . but the estimates range from break-even to 35_cents a_share . in the 1988_third quarter , quantum earned_$ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a_share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . another big polyethylene producer , union_carbide corp. , is_expected to post profit of between $_1 a_share and $_1.25 , compared_with $ 1.56 a_share a year_earlier , when the company_earned $ 213 million on sales of $ 2.11 billion . himont , quantum and union_carbide all declined to comment .
