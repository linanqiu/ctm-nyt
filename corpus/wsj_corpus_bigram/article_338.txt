texaco inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in texas for $ 476.5 million , its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with pennzoil co. began more_than four_years ago . the white plains , n.y. , oil company said friday that it had acquired tana production corp. , a subsidiary of trt energy holdings_inc. , for $ 95.1 million in cash , with the rest 0 to be_paid in shares of a new , non-voting issue of preferred_stock . tana , which_holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south texas , will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves . the fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion_cubic feet of natural_gas and four million_barrels of oil . `` this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base , '' said chief_executive officer james w. kinnear . texaco has also been attempting_to sell oil properties . at_least two_years ago , the company put 60 million_barrels of oil reserves on the block . they_were either too small or uneconomic 0 to maintain , the company said_0 . not all of those parcels have yet_been sold . texaco acquired tana before it completed those sales because tana 's properties are high quality and near other fields 0 texaco already_owns , a company spokeswoman_said 0 . texaco , like many other oil_companies , has_been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves . texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused_on its brawl with pennzoil and then on new_york investor carl c. icahn 's attempt_to take_over the company . pennzoil had sued texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion_of getty oil co . eventually , texaco , which was forced into bankruptcy_proceedings by that litigation , settled its fight with pennzoil for $_3 billion in 1986 . mr._icahn , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company , sold his stake_in texaco just last_summer . completion of texaco 's acquisition of tana is_subject to government approval under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act .
