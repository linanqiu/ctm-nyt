whitbread &_co. put its spirits division up for sale , triggering a scramble among global groups for the british company 's brands . whitbread already_has been approached by `` about_half a dozen '' companies interested_in buying all or part_of the spirits business , a spokesman_said 0 . analysts_expect the spirits operations and some california vineyards that also are_being sold to fetch about # 500_million -lrb- $ 788.8 million -rrb- . among the brands for sale are beefeater gin , the no._2 imported gin in the u.s. , and laphroaig single-malt whiskey . also for sale are buckingham wile co. , which distributes cutty sark blended whiskey in the u.s. , and whitbread 's atlas peak vineyards in california 's napa valley . beefeater alone is worth as_much as # 300_million , analysts said_0 . whitbread bought the beefeater distillery two_years ago for # 174.5 million . that purchase represented an_attempt by whitbread , a venerable british brewer , to become a major player in the global liquor business . but whitbread has_been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry . now , it wants to concentrate_on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations . for rival liquor companies , the whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to_acquire valuable brands . `` it 's not very often 0 something like this comes up , '' said ron littleboy , a liquor company analyst_at nomura research_institute in london . `` the division will_be sold_off quite rapidly , '' predicted neill junor , an_analyst at london brokers county_natwest woodmac . among possible buyers , grand_metropolitan plc might find beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio . grand met owns bombay gin , the no._3 imported gin in the u.s. ; rival guinness plc has the no._1 imported brand , tanqueray . the whitbread spirits auction `` is an extremely interesting development ... and naturally we_'ll be considering it carefully , '' a grand met spokesman_said 0 . guinness , which_owns several leading whiskey brands plus gordon 's gin , the world 's no._1 gin , is considered less likely_to bid for the whitbread spirits . a guinness spokesman_declined to comment . two other global liquor giants , canada 's seagram co. and britain_'s allied-lyons plc , also are possible buyers . seagram 's gin is the world 's no._2 gin brand , but the company does_n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the u.s. . allied-lyons , while powerful in whiskey , does_n't own any major white-spirit brands . ``_we will certainly have to take a look_at '' the whitbread spirits business , an allied-lyons spokesman_said 0 . ``_we would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio . '' a seagram spokesman in new_york would n't_comment . smaller liquor companies , such_as brown-forman corp. and american_brands inc. of the u.s. , also are_likely to be interested . such companies `` are increasingly being left_behind '' in the global liquor business , says_0 nomura 's mr. littleboy . in new_york , a spokesman for american_brands would n't_comment . brown-forman , a louisville , ky. distiller , also declined to comment . whitbread 's wine , spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # 35.4 million on sales of # 315.5 million in the year_ended feb. 25 . the company , which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests , did_n't break out results for the businesses 0 it plans to sell . but analysts_estimate their trading profit at # 30 million . whitbread had total pretax_profit in the year_ended feb. 25 of # 223.2 million , on sales of # 2.26 billion . whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the british beer industry . earlier_this year , the government announced_plans to foster increased_competition in the industry . british brewers currently own thousands_of pubs , which in turn sell only the breweries ' beer and soft_drinks . under new rules , many of the country 's pubs would become `` free houses , '' selling beers of their choice . whitbread now intends_to bolster its brewing interests , in an_effort to grab a_share of sales to free houses . the company , which last_month paid # 50.7 million for regional british brewer boddington group_plc , has about 13_% of the british beer market . whitbread also_owns the license to brew and distribute heineken and stella artois beers in britain . in_addition , whitbread intends_to focus_on its newer hotel , liquor store and restaurant businesses in europe and north_america . in britain , those interests include the beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with pepsico_inc. of the country 's pizza_hut chain . in canada and the u.s. , whitbread owns the keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants . focusing_on beer , restaurants and hotels means 0 ``_we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively , '' peter jarvis , whitbread 's managing_director , said_0 in a statement . the spirits business `` would_require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players . '' whitbread also announced that mr. jarvis , who is 48 , will_become the company 's chief_executive march 1 . at that time sam whitbread , the company 's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder , will_retire from executive duties . he will_retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman .
