nrm energy co. said_0 it filed materials with the securities and exchange_commission calling for it to restructure into a corporation from a limited_partnership . the partnership said_0 it is proposing the change largely_because the provisions of its senior_notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding . nrm suspended its common distribution in june 1988 and the distribution on its $_2 cumulative_convertible acquisition preferred units in_september . however , unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred are cumulative and would total $ 23 million a year , hurting nrm 's financial flexibility and its ability_to raise capital , nrm said_0 . in following several other oil and gas partnerships that have made the conversion to a corporation in the last_year , nrm also_noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said_0 it would save $_2 million a year in administrative_costs from the change . under the plan , nrm said_0 holders of its common units will_receive one share of new common_stock in edisto resources corp. for every 14.97 common units owned . holders of nrm 's $_2 cumulative_convertible acquisition preferred units will_receive one new common share in edisto for every 1.342 units 0 they own . after the transaction , current common unitholders will own about 21.3 % of edisto , current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3 % , and current stockholders of edisto will own about 6.4_% , about the same stake as edisto owns now in nrm . edisto currently is the general_partner of nrm . as the largest holder of acquisition preferred units , mesa limited_partnership would own about 28_% of edisto after the transaction . as_part of the transaction , edisto agreed_to give mesa , an amarillo , texas , oil and gas partnership managed by t. boone pickens jr. , a seat on its board . nrm said_0 its $ 2.60 senior cumulative_convertible preferred units will_be converted_into an equal number_of shares of $ 2.60 senior cumulative_convertible preferred_stock of edisto . the transaction is_subject to approval of nrm unitholders of record on_oct. 23 , among_other conditions . nrm said_0 it_expects unitholders to vote_on the restructuring at a meeting dec._15 .
