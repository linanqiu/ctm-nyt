despite a deluge of economic news , the treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over international_business machines_corp. 's huge debt offering . `` there_were so_many economic reports but the market did_n't care about any of them , '' said kathleen camilli , a money market economist_at drexel_burnham lambert_inc . `` so the focus turned to other fixed-income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said . ibm , the giant computer_maker , offered $_750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1\/2 percentage_point higher_than the yield on_30-year treasury_bonds . the size of ibm 's issue was increased from an originally_planned $_500 million as money_managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds . in the investment-grade_corporate market , `` it 's rare that you_get an_opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said_0 james ednie , a drexel industrial bond trader . money_managers ranked ibm 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term_debt by companies with triple-a credit are infrequent . syndicate officials at lead_underwriter salomon_brothers inc. said_0 the debentures were snapped by up pension_funds , banks , insurance_companies and other institutional_investors . in the treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy . `` whether you thought_0 the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic_indicators did_n't change your opinion , '' said charles lieberman , a managing_director at manufacturers_hanover securities_corp . the government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in_september while construction_spending was slightly_lower . both indicators were viewed_as signs that the nation_'s industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all . a survey by the federal_reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the national_association of purchasing management blurred that picture of the economy . in a monthly report prepared for use at the fed 's next federal open_market committee meeting on nov. 14. , the nation_'s central_bank found that price increases have moderated and economic_activity has_grown at a sluggish pace in recent_weeks . among_other things , the survey_found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries . the philadelphia and cleveland districts , for_example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the boston , dallas and san_francisco banks noted_that business expanded . the purchasing_managers index of economic_activity rose in october , although it remains below_50 % . a reading below_50 % indicates_that the manufacturing_sector is slowing while a reading_above 50_% suggests_that the industry is expanding . mr. lieberman said_0 the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . '' the employment_report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond_prices , is due out tomorrow . the average estimate of 22 economists polled by dow_jones capital_markets report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in october . the economists forecast a 0.1_% rise in the unemployment_rate to 5.4 % . treasury_securities in a surprise announcement , the treasury said_0 it will reopen the outstanding benchmark_30-year bond rather_than create a new one for next_week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt . the treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year_notes . but rather_than sell new 30-year_bonds , the treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark_30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in_august . credit market analysts said_0 the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1\/8 % bond_due august 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face_amount . some dealers_said 0 the treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor_demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur . the treasury said_0 the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an_increase in the federal debt_ceiling . until such action takes places , the treasury has no ability_to issue new debt of any kind . meanwhile , treasury_bonds ended modestly_higher in quiet_trading . the benchmark_30-year bond about 1\/4_point , or $_2.50 for each $_1,000 face_amount . the benchmark was_priced at_102 22\/32 to yield 7.88_% compared_with 102 12\/32 to yield 7.90_% tuesday . the latest_10-year notes were_quoted at 100 22\/32 to yield 7.88_% compared_with 100 16\/32 to yield 7.90_% . the discount_rate on three-month_treasury bills was essentially unchanged_at 7.79 % , while the rate on_six-month bills was slightly_lower at 7.52_% compared_with 7.60_% tuesday . corporate issues ibm 's $_750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market . meanwhile , most investment-grade_bonds ended_unchanged to as_much as 1\/8 point_higher . in its latest compilation of performance statistics , moody_'s investors_service found that investment-grade_bonds posted a total_return of 2.7 % in october while junk_bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % . moody_'s said_0 those returns compare with a 3.8_% total_return for longer-term treasury notes and bonds . total_return measures price changes and interest_income . for the year to date , moody_'s said_0 total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term treasury issues , closely followed_by 15_% for investment-grade_bonds . junk_bonds trailed the group again . `` even the 7.2_% return from the risk-free three-month_treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk_bonds , '' wrote moody_'s economist john lonski in yesterday 's market report . `` little wonder that buyers for junk have_been found wanting , '' he said . moody_'s said_0 the average net_asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual_funds fell by 4.2_% in october . mortgage-backed issues mortgage_securities ended slightly_higher but trailed gains in the treasury market . ginnie_mae 's 9_% issue for november_delivery finished_at 98 5\/8 , up 2\/32 , and its 9_1\/2 % issue at 100 22\/32 , also up 2\/32 . the ginnie_mae 9_% securities were yielding 9.32 % to a 12-year_average life . activity was light in derivative_markets , with no new issues priced . municipal issues municipal_bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1\/8 point in light , cautious trading prior to tomorrow 's unemployment report . a $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue_bonds from the california health facilities financing_authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively_priced by a first_boston corp. group . an_official for the lead_underwriter declined to comment_on the reason for the delay , but market_participants speculated_that a number_of factors , including a lack_of investor_interest , were responsible . the issue could_be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next_week , according_to the lead_underwriter . a $ 107.03 million offering of santa_ana community redevelopment agency , calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may_be repriced at lower levels today , according_to an_official with lead_underwriter donaldson_lufkin &_jenrette securities_corp . the santa_ana bonds were tentatively_priced to yield from 6.40 % in 1991 to 7.458 % in bucking the market trend , an issue of $_130 million general_obligation distributable state aid bonds from detroit , mich. , apparently drew solid investor_interest . they_were tentatively_priced to yield from_6.20 % in 1991 to 7.272 % in foreign bond west_german dealers_said 0 there was little interest in treasury_bonds ahead of thursday 's new government bond_issue . so_far , they said_0 , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more_than 7_% . it is generally expected to be the usual 10-year , four billion mark issue . rumors to the contrary have_been that it would_be a six billion mark issue , or that the last bund , a 7_% issue due_october 1999 , would_be increased by two billion marks . elsewhere : -- in japan , the benchmark no._111 4.6_% issue due_1998 ended on
