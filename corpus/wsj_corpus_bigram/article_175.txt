in an oct. 10 editorial-page_article , `` it 's the world bank 's turn to adjust , '' paul craig roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing_countries at the doorstep of the world bank . the article is , unfortunately , replete with outrageous distortions . one of mr._roberts 's observations is that the bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing_countries . this is just not so . the reality is that bank finances are rock solid . as of june_30 , 1989 -- the day 0 our past fiscal_year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the bank 's portfolio was affected_by arrears of over six_months . this is an enviably low level . moreover , the bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set_aside $_800 million against possible loan_losses . for the same fiscal_year , by the way , the bank 's net_income was a robust $_1.1 billion after provisions . because of the business-like manner in which the bank goes about development , financial_markets have confidence in it . this helps explain the triple-a rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability_to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal_1989 on the most advantageous terms . another of mr._roberts 's criticisms is that bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away_from economic_development . '' here , too , mr._roberts is way off the mark . the reality is that bank_loans have_been linked to policy improvements for 40 years . our traditional project loans have , for_instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public_utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies . by and large , these efforts have borne fruit . in my home region , latin_america , much of the existing infrastructure base -- an_important building block for development -- has_been financed_by the world bank . mr._roberts also takes a swipe at the bank 's adjustment lending . what are the facts on this type of lending ? the bank has_been making adjustment loans for 10_years . as their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get_back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . typically , these measures include reforms 0 to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to_promote the development of a vigorous private_sector . support for the private_sector has_been a longstanding concern of the bank 's . over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third_world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp . most recently , the bank group has_been expanded to include the multilateral investment guarantee agency to stimulate direct foreign_investment in developing_countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate . these are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as mr._roberts alleges . rather , they reflect the bank 's time-tested , pragmatic approach , which aims at ensuring that developing_countries put their scarce resources to the best_possible use . francisco aguirre-sacasa director , external affairs the world bank
