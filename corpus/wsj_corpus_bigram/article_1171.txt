a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic , not unheroic , though sadly self-deceived english butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic english novel of manners , like britannia herself , still ruled the waves . in fact , kazuo ishiguro 's `` the remains of the day '' -lrb- knopf , 245 pages , $_18.95 -rrb- is both an homage to traditional english forms and a dramatic critique of them . it implies that the british empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds , manners and morals , and argues , tacitly , that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery , willful blindness , role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants . as the narrator stevens , the solitary butler of darlington hall , mulls over such hallowed terms as `` greatness , '' `` dignity , '' `` service '' and `` loyalty , '' we see_how pious cant subverts the soul . stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master 's -- destroys all 0 it was designed to preserve . such armor crushes the soldier . the mask cuts to the quick . it 's 1956 , the year 0 the suez crisis marked the final end of empire . as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from oxfordshire to cornwall , where a former housekeeper resides , perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage , perhaps -lrb- he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge -rrb- not disinclined to return to domestic service , stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait , a credo and the author 's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel 0 we_'re reading : ``_we call this land of ours great_britain , and there may_be those_who believe this a somewhat immodest practice . yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective ... . it is the very lack_of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart . what is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty , its sense of restraint . it is as though the land knows of its_own beauty , of its_own greatness , and feels no need to shout it . in comparison , the sorts of sights offered in such places as africa and america , though undoubtedly very exciting , would , i_am sure , strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness . '' an effusive landscape ? an ill-mannered mountain ? but let stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner -lrb- his conscious efforts at `` banter '' always fail -- most comically -rrb- : `` this whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years : what is a ` great ' butler ? '' his answer is one `` possessed of a dignity in keeping with his_position . '' such dignity `` has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being 0 he inhabits . '' he `` will not be shaken out by external events , however surprising , alarming or vexing ... . continentals are unable_to be butlers because_they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of . '' despite his racial advantage , to be a great butler is a heroic calling ; one 's pantry is `` not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle . '' if , for_example , in the midst_of a great social occasion -lrb- such_as an international conference on revising the versailles treaty in 1923 -rrb- , one 's 72-yearold father , himself a great butler once , should happen to die of a stroke , one must continue to serve the port : `` please do_n't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment . you see , i_know 0 my father would_have wished me to carry on just now . '' it is this_kind of dignity and restraint that allows stevens to declare : `` for all its sad associations , whenever i recall that evening today , i find 0 i_do so with a large sense of triumph . '' we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow . that stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent , but funny and sad and enlightening , is entirely the author 's triumph . mr. ishiguro 's ability_to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic , cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel , `` an artist of the floating world , '' set in japan after the war . now shifting his scene from the country 0 he left at five to the england 0 he has lived in for nearly 30_years , he has fashioned a novel in the mode of henry james and e.m. forster . with great aplomb he considers not_only filial devotion and -lrb- utterly repressed -rrb- sexual love , but british anti-semitism , the gentry 's impatience with democracy and support of hitler , and the moral problematics of loyalty : `` it is , in practice , simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same_time provide good service ... . ` this employer embodies all that i find noble and admirable . i will hereafter devote myself to serving him . ' this is loyalty intelligently bestowed . '' in the end , after meeting with the former housekeeper , stevens sits by the seashore at dusk , thinking of her and of his employer , and declares ``_i trusted . i trusted in his lordship 's wisdom ... . i_ca n't even say_0 i made my_own mistakes . really -- one has to ask oneself -- what dignity is there in that ? '' the loyal servant has come full circle . what is greatness ? what is dignity ? we understand 0 such rueful wisdom must_be retrospective : the owl of minerva only spreads her wings at dusk . but as `` the remains of the day '' so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity , such wisdom can_be movingly embodied in art . mr. locke teaches english and comparative literature at columbia_university .
