proposals for government-operated `` national_service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew . the disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national_service . rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought_0 had_been eliminated in the early_1970s , along_with smallpox . it is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` national and community service act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this_fall . why does the national-service virus keep coming_back ? perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel . if only we could_get america 's wastrel youth into at_least a psychic uniform we might_be able_to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving . a quarter of a century ago national_service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft . those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion . choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national_service as_much as the draft . but the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years_ago , when it again was let loose . this time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal_government of educational grants and loans . why_not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ? military service , moreover , could_be a national-service option . thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national_service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals . the democratic_leadership council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought_0 it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . a provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those_who had had enough of schooling . the dlc plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $_100 a week , tax free , plus medical_care . with a tax-free $_10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would_be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year . mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would_be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high_school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . they would_be doing better financially under national_service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds_of jobs and perhaps supporting families . as it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority_interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' opposition to national_service from the pentagon , which wants to_protect its_own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped . clearly , a new rationale for national_service had to be cooked up . what better place 0 to turn than sen._edward kennedy 's labor committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can_be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ? in this case , the new recipe for national_service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -lrb- particularly satisfying to the dlc and sen. sam nunn -rrb- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -lrb- a la sen. chris dodd -rrb- , a competitive grants program to states 0 to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -lrb- a kennedy specialty -rrb- , a community service work-study program for students -lrb- pleasing to the palate of sen. dale bumpers , among_others -rrb- , plus engorgement of the vista volunteer program and the retired senior volunteer , foster grandparent , and senior companion programs . before the menu is printed , the house may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million . it is widely known that `` too_many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does_not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if_they are senators . the `` omnibus '' bill coming out of congress may_be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very_hard . the aroma of patronage is in the air . is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? on the contrary , it is as robust as ever . according_to the gallup poll , american adults contribute an_average of two_hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have_risen 30_% -lrb- adjusted_for inflation -rrb- . even_if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national_service is not the way_0 to meet them . if we_want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other_countries of offering more scholarships based_on something called `` scholarship , '' rather_than on the government 's idea of `` service . '' or we might provide a tax_credit for working students . what we_do not need to do is start a war , and then try_to justify it by creating a gi bill . to the extent 0 we lack manpower 0 to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for_example , we should raise pay , pursue labor-saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather_than overpay high_school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . will national_service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ? not_necessarily . polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing . nonetheless , senate_democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . '' so_far , the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his_own free-standing proposal to endow a `` points of light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism . however , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the white_house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal_funds for volunteer projects . there 's no need for such concessions . the omnibus can_be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected . national_service , the utopian idea , still wo_n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee-socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will_be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors . mr. chapman is a fellow at the indianapolis-based hudson institute . this_article is adapted from remarks at a hoover institution conference on national_service , in which mr. szanton also participated .
