market_makers in nasdaq_over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program_trading . their motivation , however , has a strong practical aspect : program_trading is hazardous to their paychecks . the most_controversial form of program_trading , stock-index_arbitrage , is `` making it tough for traders to make money , '' declares robert antolini , head of otc_trading at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette . stock-index_arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index_futures 0 to profit from fleeting price_discrepancies -- affects the otc_market directly through the 31 stocks included in standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index . the s&p_500 is often used in arbitrage strategies . the portion_of otc volume attributable to program_trading is n't known , as it is on the new_york stock_exchange , where it amounted_to more_than 13_% in_september . estimates from traders put it at less_than 5_% of nasdaq 's average_daily volume of roughly 133 million_shares . other market-maker gripes : program_trading also causes the nasdaq_composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock_market . because of program_trading it is more_difficult to trade many otc_stocks without sharp price moves , a condition known_as illiquidity . moreover , the price volatility that is amplified by program_trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual_investors back to an otc_market that sorely misses them . some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the otc_market . but the big , often tumultuous slide in stock_prices this_month has_turned some of those_who have_been profiting from the practice against it . peter dapuzzo , head of retail equity trading at shearson_lehman hutton , acknowledges_that he was n't troubled by program_trading when it began in the pre-crash bull_market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock_prices rising . ``_we were n't as concerned until they became sell_programs , ''_says mr._dapuzzo , who now thinks_0 it adds unnecessary volatility . shearson_lehman , however , executes program_trades for clients . merrill_lynch , goldman_sachs and kidder_peabody , in_addition to shearson , do program-trade otc_stocks . shearson , merrill_lynch and goldman_sachs say_0 they do_so only for customers , however . kidder_peabody does program_trading for its_own as_well as clients_' accounts . of course , there_were sell_programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market_makers more painfully these_days . that 's largely_because of defensive measures 0 they adopted after the 1987_crash , when individual_investors fled the market and trading_activity dwindled . market_makers , to cut_costs , slashed inventories of stocks 0 they keep on hand 0 to sell investors when other holders are n't selling . and to_protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further , market_makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell_programs are in progress . on days when prices are tumbling , they must_be willing_to buy shares from sellers when no_one else will . in such an environment , market_makers can suffer huge_losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares . `` it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when_you know 0 you_'re going_to lose , ''_says mr. antolini , of donaldson_lufkin . but this skittishness , mr. antolini says_0 , is creating liquidity problems in certain otc_stocks . `` it 's harder to sell stocks when the sell_programs come in because some market_makers do_n't want to -lcb- take the orders -rcb- . no_one has big positions and no_one wants to take big risks . '' joseph hardiman , president of the national_association of securities_dealers , which_oversees trading on nasdaq , agrees that program_trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small_investors . but , he observes 0 , while makers suffer losses when program_trading drags the market down , they also make money when program_trading pushes the prices higher . `` sometimes -lcb- traders -rcb- lose sight of that , '' he_says . the otc_stocks in the s&p_500 include nasdaq 's_biggest , such_as apple_computer , mci_communications , tele-communications and liz claiborne . these big stocks greatly influence the nasdaq_composite index . when the computers say `` sell , '' the composite tumbles as_well as the dow_jones industrial_average . the problem , market_makers say_0 , is that while the industrial_average and the s&p_500 usually recover as buy programs kick in , the nasdaq_composite frequently is left_behind . eight trading days after oct._12 , the day before the stock_market plunge , for_instance , the nasdaq_composite had_fallen 4.3_% , compared_with 3.3_% for the s&p_500 , 3.5_% for the new_york stock_exchange composite_index and 3.6_% for the industrial_average . this gap eventually closes , but slowly . three_days later , as of friday_'s close , the nasdaq_composite was down 6_% , compared_with 5.9 % for the industrial_average , 5.7 % for the s&p_500 and 5.8 % for the big_board composite . the main_reason for this lag is that individual_investors own 65_% of the otc_market 's capitalization , according_to mr. hardiman , much more_than on the big_board . such investors tend_to be more cautious than institutional_investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs , market_makers say_0 . friday_'s market_activity the nasdaq_composite index tumbled 5.39 , or 1.2_% to 452.76 on friday . for the week , the index dropped 3.8_% . weakness in big technology_stocks hurt the composite as_well as the nasdaq_100 index , which fell 1.4 % , or 6.43 , on friday , to 437.68 . the nasdaq_financial index lost about 1 % , or 3.95 , to 448.80 . friday_'s trading_volume totaled 132.8 million_shares . the average_daily share turnover for october is almost 148 million_shares . lin_broadcasting surged 4 5\/8 to 112 5\/8 ; lin and bellsouth sweetened their merger_agreement in an_attempt to_keep shareholders from tendering their shares to mccaw_cellular communications . mccaw , which dropped_2 1\/2 to 37 3\/4 , has offered $_125 a_share for a majority of lin 's shares . the revised lin-bellsouth agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special_dividend 0 lin promises to pay shareholders . lin now plans to dole out $ 42 a_share in cash , up from the earlier $ 20 amount . intel eased 1\/8 to 31 7\/8 . the semiconductor concern said_0 the interruption in shipment of its 80486 computer chip will_be brief and have little impact_on the company 's earnings . the stock fell 7\/8 thursday amid concerns over problems discovered with the chip . intel told analysts that the company will resume shipments of the chips within_two to three_weeks . weisfield_'s rocketed 9_1\/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator said_0 it is in preliminary discussions , with a party 0 it would n't_identify , regarding the possible acquisition of the company . starpointe savings_bank rose 3 to 20 after the federal_deposit insurance corp. approved dime savings_bank of new_york 's $ 21-a-share acquisition of starpointe . kirschner medical fell 4 to 15 . the company said_0 its third-quarter_earnings will_probably be lower_than the 16 cents_a share 0 it reported last_year , despite a rise in the company 's revenue . kirschner earned_$ 376,000 on revenue of $ 14.5 million in the 1988 quarter . the company blamed a number_of factors for the earnings decline , including softer sales of joint-implants .
