if this battle were a movie , the producers would_be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common . in the opener , sony_corp. would agree to buy columbia_pictures entertainment_inc. in a transaction_valued at close to $_5 billion . shortly_after that , sony would offer to buy guber-peters entertainment_co. for $_200 million and offer its co-chairmen , peter_guber and jon_peters , the chance to run columbia . mr._peters would fly to new_york with the intention of telling warner_communications inc. chairman steven j. ross that guber-peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for warner . that 's where the two scripts would diverge . in affidavits filed in los_angeles superior court in_connection with the $_1 billion breach-of-contract suit 0 warner brought_against sony for hiring the two producers , mr._guber and mr._peters tell one story . warner tells another . in the affidavits , mr._peters says_0 he was `` shocked '' when mr._ross refused a meeting and made it clear 0 he would stop them . mr._peters claims 0 he reminded mr._ross that robert daly and terry semel , the top_executives of the warner brothers studio , had `` repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept '' an offer such_as sony 's . in response , mr._peters says_0 , mr._ross referred to his_colleagues at warner with an `` obscenity '' and said : `` tell_them that they do_n't have a job . you_can take them with you . '' warner denies 0 mr._ross ever said any such thing , and , in fact , denies virtually everything 0 mr._guber and mr._peters say in their affidavits . tomorrow , warner will file another batch of documents contending that `` the essence of everything 0 these_guys are saying is basically lies , ''_says 0 warner 's chief outside counsel , stuart rabinowitz . thursday , a judge is_scheduled to rule on warner 's motion seeking to block the guber-peters duo from going_to columbia . the battery of legal documents_filed in the past_week in_connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this hollywood dogfight . but they also make it clear that the first thing 0 a judge will have to decide is which , if any , version of events in this morass is fiction , and which fact . the matter may never even be tried in court . warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations , but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both_sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship_between warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired . warner , which is in the process of merging with time_warner inc. , says_0 it is willing_to settle the matter out of court . so_far , however , sony has n't been willing_to meet its considerable financial demands . mr._guber and mr._peters do_n't have much 0 to gain from a protracted battle . sony , for its part , could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight is too_high , choosing instead to find someone_else 0 to run columbia , although that too would_be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to mr._guber and mr._peters . in that case , mr._guber and mr._peters might_not suffer financially , but they would_be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship_with warner . at the center of any court fight will_be the differing interpretations of the written contract between warner and the two producers , but other murkier issues will play a big role . sony and the guber-peters team are hanging much of their case on warner 's willingness last_year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral_agreement 0 they say_0 allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up . warner denies 0 such an_agreement was made , and disputes the guber-peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting 0 the two_sides had on the matter . just how rancorous the relationship has_become is clear from the differing versions of the two_sides ' current business dealings . mr._guber and mr._peters say in their affidavits that warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at warner , notably the sylvester stallone film `` tango and cash . '' mr._peters says in his_affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last_week that warner was `` taking_over '' the picture , and 0 another producer would_be giving all of the orders . over his objections , mr._peters says_0 , the film 's release date was moved up `` by many months '' to december , and plans for a soundtrack `` worth millions of dollars '' were dropped . hubert de la bouillaire , an editor on the film , backs mr._peters in a separate sworn declaration . mr. de la bouillaire says_0 warner brothers production president mark canton called him oct._19 and said_0 mr._peters is `` off the picture . if he calls you up , just tell him 0 everything is fine . '' the editor also says_0 the new producer on the film , bruce baird , told editors to screen the picture without telling stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell or mr._peters . `` the less they know , the easier it is for us . if someone asks , just lie and tell_them 0 it will_be done , '' mr. de la bouillaire says_0 mr. baird told them . that , says_0 warner 's mr. rabinowitz , is `` a total 100 % lie . '' the movie , he_says 0 , is in its post-production stages of `` cleaning_up the film . '' he_says 0 mr._peters and mr._guber , as the contractual producers with consultation rights , have_been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film . dozens_of guber-peters staffers are still working on the warner lot and consulting on various projects on a `` daily basis , '' the attorney says_0 . mr._guber , in his_affidavit , says that when he advised warner president terry semel of the sony offer at lunch on sept._25 , mr._semel `` hugged and congratulated me , and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company . '' mr._guber says_0 he brought to lunch a release document 0 warner had agreed_to in 1988 , when he and mr._peters made an aborted bid to buy part_of mgm\/ua entertainment_co. to run the mgm studio . mr._guber says_0 he had crossed out `` mgm '' with a red pen and written in `` columbia , '' giving the document to mr._semel . `` mr._semel said absolutely nothing 0 to indicate 0 warner would_have any objection to our assuming management positions at columbia , '' mr._guber says . mr._semel , in his_affidavit , does_n't mention any hugging or congratulating . he_says 0 he told mr._guber 0 he could_n't sign any documents and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for him and mr._peters , would_have a very negative impact_on warner . '' he said_0 he would contact mr._ross and warner brothers chairman robert daly and that , in a conference call , the three agreed 0 they could_n't let the producers out of their contract . mr._ross , in his_own affidavit , says_0 he and mr._daly instructed mr._semel to tell the producers 0 warner would n't terminate their agreement . mr._guber says that mr._semel did convey that information and that mr._semel said_0 mr._ross was `` crazy because of the time deal , '' meaning , mr._guber says , that mr._ross `` did_not want to communicate to his new merger partner , time inc. , that warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances . '' mr._guber also says in his_affidavit that mr._daly `` told us that even_if sony did_not want us , warner 's relationship_with us already was irreparably damaged , that there was no_way ` 0 to put the egg together , ' and that it would sue sony for tons of money . '' moreover , mr._guber claims 0 , mr._semel told_him that mr._ross probably would n't object `` if it were anybody other than sony . but sony is a problem . '' the guber-peters side has said_0 warner is particularly concerned_about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business . some in hollywood suggest 0 mr._guber and mr._peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such_as mr._semel and mr. canton too literally . according_to this theory , warner executives , hoping to strengthen their relationships_with the producers , encouraged mr._guber and mr._peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company . but the warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers 0 they could_get out of their written contract . mr. rabinowitz , the warner attorney , says_0 the studio still wants the producers to come_back and fulfill their contract . `` they_are like a mini-studio ; they have 50 projects in development for warner , '' he_says . but mr._guber indicates in his_affidavit that not all of the projects will_be used . for_example , he_says that since_1985 , he and mr._peters have developed over 85 movie projects , and warner has `` passed '' or chosen not to produce at_least 76 . as for the projects remaining at warner , mr._guber says_0 , `` mr._semel informed me that warner 's producers have already started a ` feeding_frenzy ' for our projects .
