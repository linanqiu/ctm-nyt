times may_be tough on_wall street for some , but a few bosses are making as_much as ever -- or more . at bear_stearns cos. , for_example , the 15 executive officers led_by chairman_alan `` ace '' greenberg got a pay increase to $ 35.9 million for the 14-month period_ended june_30 from $ 22.9 million for the 12_months ended april 30 , 1988 . the figures do_n't include substantial dividends on holdings of bear_stearns stock . mr._greenberg himself was paid $_4.5 million , before an_estimated $_1.5 million in dividends , up from $_2.4 million the year before . the increase is noted in the brokerage_firm 's latest proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange_commission . because it operates on a fiscal_year , bear_stearns 's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms . the latest_period includes 14 months instead of 12 because bear_stearns changed to a fiscal_year ending in june instead of april . meanwhile , bear_stearns 's 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year , which the company says_0 reflected lower commission revenue caused_by a decline in investor activity in the markets . however , bear_stearns on monday reported improved_earnings for its first_quarter , ended_sept. 29 , partly_because of a 31 %_increase in commissions during the quarter . william j. montgoris , chief_financial officer , defended the lofty salaries at bear_stearns . `` all of us are on a base salary of $_200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that 's pretty low as far as wall_street goes , '' mr. montgoris said . however , bear_stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding 65 years_ago . four bear_stearns executives besides the 62-year-old mr._greenberg were paid $_3 million or more before dividends for the 14 months_ended in june . according_to the proxy statement , james_e. cayne , 55 , bear_stearns 's president , made $_3.9 million ; an executive_vice president , michael l. tarnopol , 53 , made nearly $_3.4 million ; and two executive_vice presidents , vincent j. mattone , 44 , and william j. michaelcheck , 42 , made about $ 3.3_million each . mr. montgoris said_0 the firm has a `` straight mathematical formula '' for determining compensation , based_on the firm 's earnings . `` just because a particular element of the firm is down , '' such_as stockbrokerage , `` does_n't mean_0 the executive committee should_be paid less , '' he said .
