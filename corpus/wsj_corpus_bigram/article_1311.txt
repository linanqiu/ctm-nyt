measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room . procter_& gamble_co. plans to begin testing next_month a superconcentrated detergent that will_require only a few spoonfuls per washload . the move stems_from lessons learned in japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds . it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals , such_as kao corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the u.s. . the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two_years ago in japan when kao introduced a powerful detergent , called attack , which quickly won a 30_% stake_in the japanese markets . `` they do_n't want to get caught again , ''_says one industry watcher . retailers in phoenix , ariz. , say_0 p&g 's new powdered detergent -- 0 to be called cheer with color guard -- will_be on shelves in that market by early_november . a p&g spokeswoman confirmed_that shipments to phoenix started late_last month . she said_0 the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . superconcentrates are n't entirely new for p&g . the company introduced a superconcentrated lemon cheer in japan after watching the success of attack . when attack hit the shelves in 1987 , p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about 8_% from more_than 20_% . with the help of lemon cheer , p&g 's share is now estimated to be 12_% . while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for p&g will_be in the $_4 billion u.s. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders . the company may_have chosen to market the product under the cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling tide into 16 different varieties , including this_year 's big hit , tide with bleach . with superconcentrates , however , it is n't_always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many_people tend_to dump too_much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . in the early_1980s , p&g tried_to launch here a concentrated detergent under the ariel brand name that it markets in europe . but the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new cheer , bombed in a market test in denver and was dropped . p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience . but p&g contends_0 the new cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading . and retailers are_expected to embrace the product , in part because it will_take up less shelf space . `` when shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , ''_says hugh zurkuhlen , an_analyst at salomon bros . but with so_many brands vying for space , that 's no_longer the case . if the new cheer sells well , the trend_toward smaller packaging is_likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their_own superconcentrates . then retailers `` will_probably push the -lcb- less-established -rcb- brands out altogether , '' he_says 0 . competition is bound to get tougher if kao introduces a product like attack in the u.s. . to be_sure , kao would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away_from the mighty p&g , which has about 23_% of the market . kao officials previously have said_0 they_are interested_in selling detergents in the u.s. , but so_far the company has focused_on acquisitions , such_as last_year 's purchase of andrew jergens co. , a cincinnati hand-lotion maker . it also has a product-testing facility in california . some believe_0 p&g 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese . `` this is something 0 p&g would do with or without kao , ''_says mr. zurkuhlen .
