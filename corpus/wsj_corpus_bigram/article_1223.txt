'' when it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , big_board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone . they said_0 the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could_n't have performed better . ``_we had no operating problems at all , '' mr._phelan said after the market closed . `` all the things that we set_up to slow_down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . '' prices for the 416.3 million_shares that changed_hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said_0 . while reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume_was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said_0 it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the october_1987 crash . the so-called circuit_breakers devised by the big_board and the chicago_mercantile exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures_prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day . despite traders ' complaints , mr._phelan said_0 the links with the chicago futures market worked as planned in friday_'s rout to provide a cooling-off period . of greater help , the big_board chairman said_0 , was the `` natural circuit_breaker '' of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market .
