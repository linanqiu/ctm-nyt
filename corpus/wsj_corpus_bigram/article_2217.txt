wall_street would like ual_corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent . but what_happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most_powerful and fractious unions : the pilots and machinists . some people_familiar with the situation believe_that the collapse of the previous $_6.79 billion buy-out , if anything , may_have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups . as a result , both may now have virtual veto power over any ual transaction . one_reason : banks -- likely_to react to any new ual_deal with even more caution than the first_time around -- probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put_up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan . `` united pilots have_shown on a number_of occasions 0 they_are willing and able_to strike , '' said an executive at fuji bank , one of ual 's large lenders . `` if_you have both -lcb- labor -rcb- groups on strike , you_'ve got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing 0 for a bank to be looking_at . '' just this past_week , a leading japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists_' union_leaders 0 to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible . another_reason : emboldened by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction , the machinists are_likely to be more_aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs . the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to_settle with either on new contracts . that gives_them both the threat of a strike and the ability_to resist any wage concessions that may_be necessary to make a transaction work . thus , even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special_dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key . `` there 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions , '' said richard nye , of baker , nye investments , a new_york takeover stock-trader . mr. nye thinks_0 the ual_board should_be ousted if it_does n't move soon to increase shareholder_value . both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend_to block any transaction 0 they do_n't like . `` the pilots will_be involved in any transaction that takes place around here , '' pilot_union chairman frederick c. dubinsky declared yesterday . but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries , the machinists , is another question . the pilots_' mr. dubinsky says_0 his union would like majority_ownership for employees . at the very least , the pilots want some form of control over the airline , perhaps through super-majority voting_rights . on the other_hand , the machinists have always opposed majority_ownership in_principle , saying_0 they do_n't think_0 employees should_be owners . still , in recent_days , machinists_' union_leaders have_shown some new flexibility . ``_we may_be able_to reach a tradeoff where we_can accommodate -lcb- the pilot_union 's -rcb- concerns and ours , '' said brian m. freeman , the machinists_' financial_adviser . mr._freeman said_0 machinists_' union advisers plan to meet this_week to try_to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special_dividend for shareholders , an employee stake and , perhaps , an equity investment by a friendly investor . if a compromise ca_n't be_reached , the pilots maintain 0 they_can do a transaction without the support of the machinists . but at this point , that may just be wishful thinking . the machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from ual pilots and management for the company . their opposition helped scare off some japanese_banks . the pilots_' insistence on majority_ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult 0 to achieve . `` who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled_by the pilots_' union ? '' asks candace browning , an_analyst at wertheim schroeder &_co . `` who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots ? '' she adds . ms. browning says_0 she believes_0 a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand_for control . she also notes that even_if the pilots accept a minority_stake now , they still could come_back at a later time and try_to take control . another possibility is for the pilots_' to team up with an outside investor who might try_to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents . in that way , the pilots may_be able_to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority_stake , or to consider the labor-management_group 's latest proposal . the group did_n't make a formal offer , but instead told ual 's advisers before the most-recent board_meeting that it was working on a bid valued_at between $_225 and $_240 a_share . but again , they may need the help of the machinists . ``_i think_0 the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen , '' said one official familiar_with the situation . the board and ual 's management , he_says 0 , `` ca_n't go_back '' to business as_usual . `` the pilots wo_n't let_them .
