while corn and soybean prices have slumped well_below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high . and they_'re likely_to stay that way for months 0 to come , analysts_say 0 . for one_thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this_year than last , tight wheat supplies are_likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts_say 0 . and if rain does_n't fall soon across many of the great plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could_be reduced , further squeezing supplies . also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet_union will place substantial buying orders over the next_few months . by next may 31 , stocks of u.s. wheat 0 to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million_bushels . that would_be the lowest_level since the early_1970s . stocks were 698 million_bushels on may 31 of this_year . in response to dwindling domestic supplies , agriculture secretary clayton yeutter last_month said_0 the u.s. government would slightly increase the number_of acres 0 farmers can plant in wheat for next_year and still qualify_for federal support payments . the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next_year by about 66 million_bushels . it now estimates production for next_year at just under 2.6_billion bushels , compared_with this_year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 . but the full effect_on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo_n't be felt until the second_half of next_year . until then , limited stocks are_likely to_keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts_say 0 . on the chicago_board of trade friday , wheat for december_delivery settled_at $ 4.0675 a_bushel , unchanged . in theory at_least , tight supplies next_spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said daniel basse , a futures analyst_with agresource co. in chicago . such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures_trading this_summer on the chicago_board of trade . in july , the cbot ordered ferruzzi finanziaria s.p . a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million_bushels of soybeans . the exchange said_0 it feared that some members would n't be_able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would_have to default on their contractual obligation to the italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce_its holdings . ferruzzi has denied 0 it was trying_to manipulate the soybean futures market . unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the great plains and in wheat-growing areas in washington and oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said_0 conrad leslie , a futures analyst and head of leslie analytical in chicago . for_example , in the oklahoma panhandle , 40_% or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . that figure climbs to about 47_% in wheat-growing portions of kansas , he said_0 . the soviet_union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts_expect moscow to place sizable orders for u.s. wheat in the next_few months , further supporting prices . `` wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of soviet demand '' in coming_weeks , predicted 0 richard feltes , vice_president , research , for refco inc. in chicago . looking_ahead to other_commodity markets this_week : orange juice traders will_be watching to see_how long and how far the price decline that began friday will_go . late_thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have_been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 florida orange crop . it was near the low range of estimates , at 130_million 90-pound boxes , compared_with 146.6 million boxes last season . however , as expected , brazil waited for the crop estimate to come_out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $_1.55 . friday_'s consequent selling of futures_contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might_have had and sent the november orange juice contract down as_much as 6.55 cents_a pound at one time . it settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . brazilian juice , after a delay caused_by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large_quantities . brazil wants to stimulate demand_for its product , which is going_to be in plentiful supply . the price cut , one_analyst said_0 , appeared to be aimed even more at europe , where consumption of brazilian juice has_fallen . it 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong_dollar has made it more_expensive in europe , the analyst said_0 . new_york futures_prices have dropped significantly from more_than $_2 a pound at midyear . barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure_on prices is_likely to continue into january , when harvesting and processing of oranges in florida reach their peak , the analyst said_0 . energy although some_analysts look for profit-taking in the wake_of friday_'s leap in crude_oil prices , last_week 's rally is generally expected to continue this_week . ``_i would_continue to look for a stable crude market , at_least in futures '' trading , said william hinton , an energy futures broker with stotler &_co . friday capped a week of steadily rising crude_oil prices in both futures and spot markets . on the new_york mercantile_exchange , west_texas intermediate crude for november_delivery finished_at $ 20.89 a_barrel , up 42 cents on the day . on european markets , meanwhile , spot prices of north_sea crudes were up 35 to 75_cents a_barrel . `` this market still wants to go higher , '' said nauman barakat , a first vice_president at shearson_lehman hutton_inc . he predicted that the november contract will reach $ 21.50 a_barrel or more on the new_york mercantile_exchange . there has_been little news 0 to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets . analysts generally cite a lack_of bearish developments as_well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes . there also are recurring reports that the soviet_union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca_n't produce as_much as it could sell . many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality crudes such_as those produced in the north_sea and in nigeria .
