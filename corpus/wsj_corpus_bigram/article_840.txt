in a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial_markets from the california_earthquake , the securities and exchange_commission said_0 it temporarily reassigned options listed on the pacific stock_exchange to the american , new_york and philadelphia stock_exchanges and to the chicago_board options_exchange . the decision , which affects millions of dollars of trading positions , was made late_yesterday because the pacific_exchange 's options floor was shut_down as a result of tuesday 's earthquake . the sec , faced_with a major squeeze on options positions , said_0 it was necessary to ensure_that options listed on the exchange could_be traded today and tomorrow . sec_chairman richard_breeden said_0 the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the pacific_exchange , guaranteeing the liquidity of the market . officials at the four exchanges said_0 well over 50 traders from the pacific_exchange were taking flights from san_francisco late_yesterday to the american , new_york and philadelphia exchanges and to the cboe , where they would_continue making markets in the pacific-listed options . the big_board said_0 carpenters quickly erected a new options floor 0 to accomodate 40 traders from the pacific_exchange . in_addition , specialists on the exchanges agreed_to provide backup capital for market-making in pacific_exchange options traded on the exchanges . trading was light on the pacific stock_exchange yesterday , with workers at the exchange 's main floor in san_francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage . the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading . the pacific_exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues , including highly active hilton hotels corp. , which is listed on the big_board . investors were concerned that they might_be unable_to exercise options that expire tomorrow . but professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even_if it were to persist for several days . ``_i 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability_to exercise their options , because_they are guaranteed_by the options_clearing corp. , '' said michael schwartz , a senior registered options strategist_at oppenheimer_& co . the sec reassigned trading in the options , however , to allow investors to do more_than simply exercise the options . while the exchange 's equities floor in san_francisco remained open on a limited basis , orders were being routed and executed in los_angeles . workers could dial out , but they could_n't receive telephone_calls . `` it 's a very uncertain situation right_now , '' said navin vyas , administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange , which has daily_volume of about 10 million_shares . because the exchange 's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange 's trading operations in los_angeles , `` business is as_usual '' mr. vyas said_0 . `` if one city is down , the other can take_over . '' meanwhile , the brokerage_firms in san_francisco were trying_to cope . charles daggs , chairman and chief_executive officer of sutro &_co. , said_0 traders came to work at 5 a.m. pdt -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would_have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there . that should happen by today , he said_0 . traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows , despite large cracks in the walls and a lack_of incoming phone_calls . also , most of the telecommunications_equipment was out . the traders were executing municipal bond , mutual_fund and other orders through a sister firm , tucker anthony inc. , which is also owned_by john hancock freedom securities but is based in new_york . ``_we are having a regular day . volume is down out of san_francisco , but not out of the 11 outlying offices , '' mr. daggs added . sutro 's oakland office executed orders through the sacramento office , which was n't affected_by the quake . others , like prudential-bache_securities inc. , which has eight offices in the san_francisco area , set_up an 800 number yesterday_morning for customers to_obtain market commentary and other help . at kidder , peabody_& co. 's sacramento branch , manager janet white received calls yesterday_morning from workers in san_francisco who offered to work in sacramento . then she discovered that quotron systems_inc. 's sacramento lines were down , because_they are normally tied in through a system that goes through san_francisco . so the kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks . at quotron , the company 's national call-in center , which swung into action for the first_time last_month for hurricane_hugo , assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday 0 to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders . the company dispatched as many as 200 people in the san_francisco area 0 to do the work , though most of the rerouting was done by computer . service appeared to be down throughout the financial_district in downtown san_francisco , while just parts of oakland and san_jose were knocked_out . but dale irvine , director of the emergency center , said_0 service was being restored to outlying san_francisco areas . in chicago yesterday , options_clearing confirmed_that it guarantees the pacific_exchange options . the firm also will permit its members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the pacific_exchange '' even_if the exchange is closed , said_0 wayne luthringshausen , chairman of options_clearing . -lrb- put options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to sell a financial instrument at a specified_price , while call options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy a financial instrument at a specified_price -rrb- . investors and traders in pacific_exchange options `` are protected to the extent that they_can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument , '' mr. luthringshausen said_0 . ``_we are seeing such exercises today , in fact .
