investors are appealing to the securities and exchange_commission not to limit their access to information_about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders . a sec proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool , individual_investors and professional money_managers contend 0 . they make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that , among_other things , would exempt many middle-management executives from reporting trades in their_own companies_' shares . the proposed_changes also would_allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often . many of the letters maintain that investor_confidence has_been so shaken by the 1987 stock_market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get_out of stocks altogether . `` the sec has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level_playing field , '' wrote clyde s. mcgregor of winnetka , ill. , in one of the 92 letters 0 the agency has received since the changes were proposed aug. 17 . `` apparently the commission did_not really believe in this ideal . '' currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies_' shares within about a month after the transaction . but about 25_% of the insiders , according_to sec figures , file their reports late . the changes were proposed in an_effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said_0 brian lane , special counsel at the sec 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes . investors , money_managers and corporate officials had until today to comment_on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , mr._lane said_0 . the sec will_probably vote_on the proposal early_next year , he said_0 . not all those_who wrote oppose the changes . the committee on federal regulation of securities for the american bar_association argues , for_example , in its lengthy letter to the sec , that the proposed_changes `` would substantially improve the -lcb- law -rcb- by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities . '' what the investors who oppose the proposed_changes object to most is the effect 0 they say_0 the proposal would_have on their ability_to spot telltale `` clusters '' of trading_activity -- buying or selling by more_than one officer or director within a short period of time . according_to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more_than a third . the sec 's mr._lane vehemently disputed those estimates . the rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions , such_as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , mr._lane said_0 . the proposed rules also would_be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said_0 . companies would_be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time . considered as a whole , mr._lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will_be at_least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions . '' but robert gabele , president of invest\/net , a north miami , fla. , company that packages and sells the insider-trading data , said_0 the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports . many investors wrote asking the sec to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later . but mr._lane said that while the sec regulates who files , the law tells them when to do_so . investors who_want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress , he_added 0 . the sec would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said_0 .
