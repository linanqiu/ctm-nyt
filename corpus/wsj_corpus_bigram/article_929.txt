crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake_damage occurred to san_francisco area refinery complexes , but the rise quickly fizzled when it became_apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed . trading on little specific information , market players overnight in tokyo began bidding up oil_prices . the rally spread into european markets , where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the san_francisco area 's large oil refining plants . by yesterday_morning , much of the world was still unable_to reach san_francisco by telephone . west_texas intermediate was bid up more_than 20 cents_a barrel in many overseas markets . at the opening of the new_york mercantile_exchange , west_texas intermediate for november_delivery shot up 10_cents a_barrel , to $ 20.85 , still on the belief_that the refineries were damaged . in the san_francisco area , roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude , about a third of all the refining capacity in california , is processed daily , according_to industry data . for more_than the past year , even the rumor of a major west_coast refinery shutdown has_been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight . but yesterday , as the morning wore on , some major west_coast refinery operators --_including chevron_corp. , exxon_corp. and the shell_oil co._unit of royal dutch\/shell group -- said_0 their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally . most said_0 they shut_down their petroleum pipeline operations as a precaution but did_n't see any immediate damage . gasoline terminals were also largely unhurt , they said_0 . `` it 's hard to imagine how the markets were speculating , given that nobody could_get through to san_francisco , '' said one amazed oil company executive . as the news spread that the refineries were intact , crude prices plunged , ending the day at $ 20.56 a_barrel , down 19_cents . gasoline for november_delivery was off 1.26 cents_a gallon to 54.58 cents . heating_oil finished_at 60.6 cents , down 0.45 cent . `` the market was basically acting on two contradictory forces , '' said nauman barakat of shearson_lehman hutton_inc . `` one is the panic , the earthquake in san_francisco , which is positive . '' but once that factor was eliminated , traders took_profits and focused_on crude_oil inventories , mr. barakat said_0 . after the market closed tuesday , the american petroleum institute had reported that crude stocks increased by 5.7 million_barrels in the week_ended friday , which traders viewed_as bearish . but some market players still think_0 earthquake speculation could have more impact_on the oil markets . `` the problem is that while on the surface everything is all right , the question is , '' said mr. barakat , `` was there any structural_damage to the pipelines or anything_else . '' in other_commodity markets yesterday : copper : futures_prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry 's labor_situation . the december_contract declined 1.85 cents_a pound to $ 1.2645 . according_to one_analyst , workers at the cananea copper mine in mexico , which has n't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the mexican government in late august , are set to return to work . the analyst said_0 it will_take about two to three_months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities . he_added that , while there has n't been any official announcement as yet , the highland_valley mine strike in british_columbia , which has lasted more_than three_months , is regarded_as settled . another analyst said_0 the cananea return to operation may_not be as near as some expect 0 . `` there_are still negotiations taking_place on whether there will_be a loss of jobs , which has_been a critical issue all along , '' he said . nevertheless , the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will_be resolved weighed on the market , the analysts agreed 0 . both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to japan , which has_been buying copper on the world market . the first analyst said that the japanese , as_well as the chinese , bought copper earlier in the week in london , but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation , at_least over the long_term , appears to have improved . `` the focus for some time has_been on the copper supply , and good demand has_been taken for granted , '' he said . `` now that the supply situation seems to be improving , it would_be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side . '' he_noted the commerce_department report yesterday that housing_starts in_september dropped 5.2_% from august to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis , the lowest_level in seven_years . `` along_with these factors , other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy , which could mean reduced copper usage , '' he said . sugar : futures_prices extended tuesday 's gains . the march delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents , for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent . according_to one dealer , japan said_0 it has only 40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this_year by cuba under current commitments . the announcement was made because of reports tuesday that cuba would delay shipments to japan scheduled for later_this year , into early_next year . the dealer said_0 the quantity mentioned in the japanese announcement is so small that it 's meaningless . one_analyst said_0 he thought_0 the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the cuban sugar harvest caused_by adverse weather . the dealer said_0 india might_be the real factor that is keeping futures_prices firm . that country recently bought 200,000_tons of sugar and had_been expected to seek a like quantity last_week but did_n't . `` it 's known 0 they need the sugar , and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support , '' the dealer said . livestock and meats : the agriculture_department is_expected to announce tomorrow that the number_of cattle in the 13 major ranch states slipped 4_% to 8.21 million on_oct. 1 compared_with the level a year_earlier , said_0 tom morgan , president of sterling research corp. , arlington heights , ill . cattle prices have_risen in recent_weeks on speculation_that the government 's quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef . among_other things , the government is_expected to report that the number_of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter slipped 3_% . feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter , so a drop indicates_that the production of beef will dip this winter . indeed , some_analysts expect the government to report that the movement of young cattle onto feedlots in the month of september in seven big ranch states dropped 8_% compared_with the level for september_1988 .
