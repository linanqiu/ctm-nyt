freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred_by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation . trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate_increases , scheduled for this_fall or early_next year , reflecting_higher costs and tightened demand_for freight transport . major shippers say_0 they_expect freight rates to rise at_least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next_few years . that 's a big change from recent_years when freight haulage was a bright spot for u.s. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make u.s. industry more competitive abroad . `` demand has caught up with the supply of certain types_of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly_more than the inflation_rate , '' said clifford sayre , director of logistics at du_pont co . shippers surveyed recently by ohio state_university said_0 they_expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4_% this_year . only 10_% of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared_with 30_% who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . `` this is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said bernard lalonde , a transportation logistics professor_at ohio state in columbus . the deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation . carriers could use their equipment more_efficiently , leading to overcapacity 0 they_were eager to fill . shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $_150 billion , or about 6.4_% of gross_national product , down from 8_% of gnp in 1981 . but with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are_likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates . `` shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said mr. lalonde . `` shippers wo_n't be_able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years . transport rates wo_n't be an_opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . '' robert delaney , a consultant at arthur_d. little inc. , cambridge , mass. , said ``_we 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions . now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . you_'ll see carriers try_to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . '' not_everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers . `` there 's still a_lot of pressure_on rates in both rail and truck , '' said gerard mccullough , lecturer in transportation at massachusetts_institute of technology . less-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7_% rate increase implemented last_april . the carriers were competing fiercely for market share . railroad-rate increases are_likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . an_official at consolidated freightways inc. , a menlo_park , calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said_0 rate discounting in that industry has_begun to `` stabilize . '' consolidated freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3_% late this_year or early_next year , and at_least two competitors have announced similar increases . truckers are `` trying_to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said_0 michael lloyd , an_analyst at salomon bros . and `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as_much as they_can , '' he said_0 . air-freight carriers raised their rates for u.s. products going across the pacific to asia by about 20_% earlier_this month . and japan air_lines said_0 it plans to boost its rates a further 25_% over the next two_years . such rate_increases `` will increase the total cost of u.s. products and slow_down the rate of increase of u.s. exports , '' said_0 richard connors , a senior_vice president of yusen air & sea service u.s.a. inc. , the u.s. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of nippon yusen kaisha of japan . ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such_as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have_been able_to increase their rates in the last couple of years . some bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3_% to 4_% in the past_few months , '' said_0 salomon 's mr. lloyd . and ship lines carrying containers are also trying_to raise their rates . carriers boosted rates more_than 10_% in the north atlantic between the u.s. and europe last september , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . ship lines operating in the pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying u.s. exports to asia about 10_% , effective next april .
