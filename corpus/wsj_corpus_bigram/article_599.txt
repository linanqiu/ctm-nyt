the sales pitch could_n't sound better . first , there 's the name : `` asset-backed_securities . '' better_than all those offers 0 you_get to buy securities_backed by nothing . and there 's more . the assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's_biggest -- and most secure -- institutions . most earn high ratings from credit agencies . their yields are higher_than those of u.s. treasury issues . and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation_'s biggest institutional_investors . ready to jump ? well , think twice . the concept may_be simple : take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors . but the simplicity may_be misleading . skeptics say_0 the slightly_higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk . they warn that asset-backed_securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard 0 to evaluate . moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4_1\/2 years_ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession . `` a_lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , ''_says owen carney , director of the investment securities division of the u.s. comptroller of the currency . ``_we do_n't know_how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . '' such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed_securities from becoming one of wall_street 's hottest new products . since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide_variety of debt into these new securities . they have sold issues backed_by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans . they have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as_well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares . last_year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities_backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders . some predict 0 there will_be `` third_world bonds , '' backed_by loans to brazil , argentina and other debt-ridden nations . and the biggest volume this_year has_been on securities_backed by credit-card_receivables , sometimes known_as `` plastic bonds . '' `` this is the heyday of debt , ''_says james grant , editor of grant 's interest_rate observer , a newsletter . `` before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems 0 nothing will_be left unhocked . '' the result is a $ 45 billion market , according_to securities data co . that includes more_than $ 9.5 billion issued through august of this_year , up sharply from $ 6.5_billion in the comparable 1988_period -- and more_than in all of 1987 . most issues have_been sold to professional money_managers , pension_funds , bank trust departments and other institutions . but wealthy individuals also have_been jumping in , and lately brokers have_been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market . the entry fee is affordable : issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $_1,000 . ``_we expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed_securities targeted toward individual_investors , says_0 bill addiss , a senior_vice president at shearson_lehman hutton_inc . the process typically begins when an institution , such_as citibank or sears , roebuck_& co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust . the trust then issues securities -- generally due in five_years or less -- that are underwritten_by wall_street brokerage_firms and offered to investors . issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such_as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit_ratings . enthusiasts say_0 the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions . asset-backed_securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate_bonds , ''_says 0 craig j. goldberg , managing_director and head of the asset-backed_securities group at merrill_lynch capital_markets . but skeptics question_whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards 0 to compensate for the extra risks . consider a $_500 million offering of 9_% securities issued last_spring and backed_by citibank credit-card_receivables . the triple-a-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage_point above four-year treasury issues . on a $_10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year . that kind_of spread can_be critical for money_managers who buy bonds in large_quantities and whose livelihood depends_on outperforming the money_manager across the street . but for individuals who buy much_smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . `` if_you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an_extra 25 basis_points -lrb- 0.25 percentage_point -rrb- becomes an_important consideration on a career basis , ''_says mr. grant . `` but if_you 're an individual investing money and trying_to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' moreover , the interest on asset-backed_securities is fully taxable , while interest on treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . that 's why some investment managers , such_as alex powers , a vice_president of chase_manhattan bank 's private banking division , do_n't recommend most asset-backed_issues for individuals in high-tax states , such_as new_york or california . but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed_issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such_as retirement plans . he points out that institutions buying asset-backed_issues in large_quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts . another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can_be converted_into cash . the secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed_securities is relatively new and much_less active than for treasury issues . that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . that 's particularly true , analysts_say 0 , for certain of the securities , such_as those backed_by time-share loans . `` you could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , ''_says jonathan s. paris , a vice_president of european investors inc. , a new_york investment-management firm . in_addition , an_investor who wants to know the daily value of treasury_bonds , or corporate_bonds traded on the new_york stock_exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . there_are n't any such listings for asset-backed_securities . evaluating asset-backed_securities poses another problem . investors , for_instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . it is n't . the front cover of the prospectus for the citibank credit-card_receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , citibank n.a. , citicorp or any affiliate thereof . '' in other_words , if there 's a problem , do_n't expect citibank to come to the rescue . the prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed_by any government agency . that means 0 investors have to focus_on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as_well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit_ratings 0 the issue has received . that also is n't easy . take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company . the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets 0 to back the securities . nor does it cover the entire portfolio . details of credit enhancements vary_widely from issue to issue . still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed_issues -- which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim . but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when_you can_get only_slightly lower yields_on government-guaranteed paper . when_you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run_into unexpected difficulties . if a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to third_world nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed_issues that the bank supports . underwriters insist 0 these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions . but despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money_managers still worry_that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets . at a time when americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may_be taking a heady gamble that consumers will_be able_to repay loans in hard times . at the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds 0 they_can find -- that is , treasurys . that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed_securities , as_well as make it tougher to unload the latter . but it could_be much worse . some_analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues . for one_thing , credit-card loans are unsecured . in_addition , they fear that banks have_been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too_many big spenders who will default during a recession . `` a day of reckoning is coming where we_think 0 the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we_think 0 the best debt investment is u.s. government bonds , ''_says craig corcoran of davis\/zweig futures inc. , an investment advisory firm . what about triple-a-rated asset-backed_issues ? `` nope , we still say to stick with treasurys , '' mr. corcoran replies . ratings , he notes 0 , `` are subject to change . '' all this makes asset-backed_securities seem too risky for many_people . and it reminds raymond f. devoe jr. , a market_strategist at legg_mason wood walker inc. , of what he calls `` devoe 's unprovable but highly probable theory no._1 : `` more money has_been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time .
