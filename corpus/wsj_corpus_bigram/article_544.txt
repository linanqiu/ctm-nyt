when his seventh avenue fur business here was flying high 20_years ago , jack purnick had 25 workers and a large factory . now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he_says 0 is smaller_than his old storage room . he also says_0 he is losing_money now . he blames imports . but just down seventh avenue , where about 75_% of u.s. fur garments are made , larry rosen has acquired two retail_outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather . he credits imports . the difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10_years . one stuck to old-line business traditions , while the other embraced the change . `` the small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , ''_says mr. purnick , 75 years_old . ``_we make the finest product in the world , and the americans are_being kicked around . '' mr._rosen , though , believes_0 imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years . `` you_'ve got some minds here that wo_n't think progressively , '' he_says . import competition for u.s. furs has_risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent_years . merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers : the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought_0 she could buy a mink . the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $_1.8 billion a year now , triple the level in the late_1970s . it also opened the door to furs made in south_korea , china , hong_kong and other_countries . jindo furs , a large south_korean maker , says_0 it operates 35 retail_outlets in the u.s. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next_year . mr. purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made . high-end u.s. furriers say_0 these imports have n't squeezed them . but low-priced and middle-priced furriers like mr. purnick , who once saturated the five-block seventh avenue fur district , say_0 imports have cut their sales . a woman_who once would_have saved for two or three seasons to buy a u.s.-made mink can now get an imported mink right_away for less_than $_2,000 . yet mr._rosen has_turned the import phenomenon to his advantage . early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were_willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation . in 1982 , he started a factory in greece . two_years later , he opened one in west_germany . he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow_suit . by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he_says 0 he has_been able_to produce high-quality goods at low cost . to maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he_says 0 he still makes most of his furs in the u.s. . but six_years ago he also began importing from the far_east . inspired by imports , mr._rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings . this_year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green . he has leather jackets from turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars . from asia , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs . next he will_be testing pictured embroidery -lrb- called kalega -rrb- made in the far_east . he plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets . besides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later , he_adds 0 . other furriers have also benefited_from leathers . seymour schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of schreibman raphael furs inc. , treats the reverse side of a persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment . he_says 0 it accounts for 25_% of total sales . mr._rosen is also pushing retail_sales . this_year he bought two stores , one in brooklyn and one in queens . other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing . golden feldman furs inc. began retailing aggressively eight_years ago , and now retail_sales account for about 20_% of gross income . in other moves , mr._rosen says_0 he bought a truck three_years ago to reach more retailers . since_then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest . small retailers who ca_n't afford to travel to his new_york showroom have become fair game . such moves have helped mr._rosen weather the industry slump of recent_years . the industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since_1986 sales have languished at their $_1.8 billion peak . large furriers such_as antonovich inc. , fur vault inc. and evans inc. all reported losses in their latest_fiscal years . aftereffects of the 1987 stock_market crash head the list of reasons . in_addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down . the animal-rights movement has n't helped sales . warm winters over the past_two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain 0 . and those_who did_n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . `` the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs -lcb- in the u.s. . -rcb- is not as available as it was , ''_says mr. schreibman , who is starting overseas production . but even those_who have found a way_0 to cope_with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part_of their allure . `` people are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , ''_says stephen sanders , divisional merchandise manager for marshall_field 's department_store in chicago . `` you_ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists mr. purnick , the new_york furrier . he_contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long_run by reducing the prestige of furs . but mr._rosen responds : `` whatever people want to buy , i_'ll sell . the name of the game is to move goods .
