regarding your_sept. 28 politics & policy column on the party differences over cutting capital_gains or expanding iras : why_not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process ? the republicans maintain that a 30_% capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short_term and spur economic investment , while the democrats maintain that an_increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings . this is a classic example of the old saying , `` the whole is greater_than the sum of its parts . '' it 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $_50,000 to pay the same 28_% incremental tax_rate as a family with taxable income of $_250,000 . the 33_% bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level , not just the 5_% rate adjustment amount . it 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive . jeffrey t. schmidlin
