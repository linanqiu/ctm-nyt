bankers_trust new_york corp. won permission from the federal_reserve board to move the company 's private_placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary . the seemingly mundane action , which was opposed by the securities industry_association , a trade_group , has important implications for banks ' recent entry_into the underwriting of corporate securities . the fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ' securities affiliates will_be able_to underwrite . several other banks have similar applications pending . over the past_two years , the fed has given a_handful of banks ' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety_of corporate , asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities_firms . securities_firms have challenged those fed approvals , saying_0 they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses . however , the fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more_than 10_% of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks , such_as dealing in u.s. treasurys . for some banks that 10_% ceiling created problems . but , by allowing bt_securities inc. to handle private placements , the fed boosted the volume of new types_of underwriting that the unit can_do . private placements involve debt and equity securities , typically in denominations of $_1 million , that are sold to institutional_investors and are n't registered with the securities and exchange_commission . last_year , bankers_trust said_0 it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .
