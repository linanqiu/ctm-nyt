upjohn co. said_0 it will offer an early_retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge . upjohn officials said_0 they could_n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how_many , will participate_in the retirement plan . but the pharmaceutical company said_0 it `` anticipates 0 the long-term savings resulting_from the plan 's implementation will more_than offset short-term costs . '' the program , available to upjohn employees 55 years_old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10_% to 20_% . in_addition , upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six_months of base pay . chairman theodore cooper called the program part_of the company 's two-year strategy 0 to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program . '' but some_analysts questioned how_much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end_up being eliminated . `` it 's a cosmetic move , '' said jonathan s. gelles of wertheim_schroder &_co . according_to upjohn 's estimates , only 50_% to 60_% of the 1,100 eligible employees will_take advantage of the plan . upjohn further estimated that about 50_% of the employees who leave for early_retirement may_be replaced . as a result , upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more_than 21,000 jobs world-wide . in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange yesterday , upjohn shares rose 87.5_cents to $ 38.875 apiece . an upjohn spokesman_said 0 he had `` heard nothing '' 0 to suggest 0 the early_retirement package was spurred_by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which occasionally has_been the target of takeover_speculation . the company earlier_this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors . the spokesman_said 0 it is the first early_retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy . earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman_said 0 .
