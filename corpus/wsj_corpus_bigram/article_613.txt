world sugar futures_prices soared on rumors_that brazil , a major grower and exporter , might_not ship sugar this crop year and next . prices also were boosted_by another rumor that mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might_have to buy a large quantity of sugar . although traders rushed to buy futures_contracts , many remained skeptical about the brazilian development , which could_n't be confirmed , analysts said_0 . the march and may contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day . the march delivery , which has no limits , settled_at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound . the may contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents . the july delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents , while other contract months showed near-limit advances . according_to reports carried by various news services , the brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo_n't be_allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began may 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can_be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel . one_analyst , arthur stevenson , of prudential-bache_securities , new_york , estimated that 65_% or more of brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca_n't use gasoline . `` this is a demand that must_be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said mr. stevenson . brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world . a shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had_been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift 0 than had_been anticipated . during the current crop year , brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 . its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5_million tons in `` it is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year , '' explained judith ganes , analyst for shearson_lehman hutton , new_york . `` producers were granted the right earlier_this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have_begun to be issued '' yesterday . as a result , ms. ganes said_0 , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has_been shipped yet , even_though the crop year is six_months old . more_than a half of all sugar produced in brazil goes for alcohol production , according_to ms. ganes . also , there has_been a switch in the past_decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said_0 . most_important , ms. ganes noted 0 , `` brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet_been made on the suspension of exports . '' thomas oxnard , sugar analyst for painewebber in hackensack , n.j. , said : ``_i am highly skeptical that brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents_a pound . '' above all , mr. oxnard noted 0 , the situation is extremely confused . `` professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the brazilian sugar industry have_been unable_to confirm the reports or get enough information 0 to clarify the situation , '' he said . `` it 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can_be put out , such_as the one saying_0 exports will_be suspended , and no_one can confirm it . '' mr. oxnard observed that the situation in brazil is also very complicated . on the one hand , brazil started an ethanol program about 15_years ago to fuel a huge portion_of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program . `` it has to weigh , on the other_hand , the relatively high price of sugar 0 it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' mr. oxnard said . mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past_two years , analysts said_0 . last_year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted 0 . this_year it is_expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000_tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said_0 . in other_commodity markets yesterday : energy : petroleum futures were generally higher with heating_oil leading the way . on the new_york mercantile_exchange , heating_oil for december_delivery increased 1.25 cents to_settle at 60.36 cents_a gallon . gasoline futures were_mixed to unchanged . but the strength in heating_oil helped push up crude_oil . west_texas intermediate crude for december_delivery rose 13 cents_a barrel to_settle at $ 20.07 . the firmness in heating_oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the u.s. and to the latest weekly report by the american petroleum institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel . grains and soybeans_: prices_closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher_prices 0 to come . trading was muted in part because of the observance of all saints ' day across much of europe . continued export demand also supported prices . as an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the u.s. , market analysts said that late_tuesday the chinese government , which often buys u.s. grains in quantity , turned instead to britain to buy 500,000 metric_tons of wheat . traders_said 0 prices also were supported_by widespread rumors_that the soviet_union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the u.s. . that designation would , among_other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the soviets could purchase grain . the soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million_bushels of corn in october . copper : futures_prices rose , extending tuesday 's gains . the december_contract advanced 2.50 cents_a pound to $ 1.1650 . buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a chilean mine strike may_have ended almost before it began , an_analyst said_0 . according_to news service reports , most workers at the disputado mines owned_by exxon_corp. agreed_to a new two-year wage contract that includes a 5_% increase and other benefits . however , some workers have n't_yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said_0 . separately , reuter reported that the papua-new guinea government urged its parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich bougainville island for two_months . the bougainville copper mine has_been inoperative since may 15 because of attacks by native landowners who_want bougainville to secede from papua-new guinea .
