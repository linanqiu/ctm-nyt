rep. lee hamilton -lrb-_d. , ind . -rrb- said_0 he and rep. byron dorgan -lrb-_d. , n.d . -rrb- are backing away_from their proposal to make the treasury_secretary a voting member of the federal_reserve panel that sets monetary_policy . rep. hamilton said_0 the bill will_be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the fed 's open_market committee and the treasury_secretary , the chairman of the council of economic advisers and the director of the office of management and budget . the original bill was strongly_opposed by the fed and publicly criticized by friends of the fed as an_attempt to undermine the central_bank 's independence . fed critics , however , hailed it as a long overdue attempt_to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary_policy . rep. hamilton said_0 the purpose of the meetings would_be to `` improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive_branch and the fed . '' fed_chairman alan_greenspan meets regularly for lunch with treasury_secretary nicholas_brady and talks frequently with budget_director richard_darman and michael boskin , chairman of the council of economic advisers . the administration_officials do_n't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open_market committee .
