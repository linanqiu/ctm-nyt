christopher cox 's oct._13 editorial-page_article `` toward more crippling lawsuits ... '' misses the point . the 1989 americans with_disabilities act is about eliminating discriminatory barriers . when we look closely at our_own history , it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil_rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments . this is how american women won the right to vote . and it is how african-americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation . for the more_than 43 million americans with_disabilities , the 1989 americans with_disabilities act provides the missing piece . disabled americans have had their civil_rights guaranteed in all federally_funded programs since section 504 was passed as a part_of the 1973 rehabilitation act . the 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private_sector . those_who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look_at the record on the rehabilitation act . without legal recourse , there_are no guarantees of civil_rights for anyone . john_r. garrison president national easter seal society
