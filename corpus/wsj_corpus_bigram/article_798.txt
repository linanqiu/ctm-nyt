without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses , the economic and structural_damage by hurricane_hugo in south_carolina would_have been much_less , as highlighted by your_oct. 3 editorial `` subsidizing disaster . '' congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such_as the hard-hit isle of palms near charleston . as you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number_of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the coastal barrier resource system . the national taxpayers union would like congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` the coastal barrier improvement act of 1989 . '' this bill simply says that if_you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do_so without taxpayer support . private-property rights would_be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development . however , home builders would_have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction . a taxpayers union study concluded 0 the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20_years . already , the 1982 legislation has saved an_estimated $_800 million . marshall y. taylor communications director national taxpayers union
