two gunmen entered a maryland restaurant , ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads . the killers fled with less_than $_100 . describing this and other grisly killings , sen. strom thurmond -lrb-_r. , s.c . -rrb- recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death_penalty . `` the ultimate punishment , '' he declared , `` will protect the law-abiding from the vicious , cruel individuals who commit these crimes . '' there 's just one problem : the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would_be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant murders and almost_all other killings . most murders are state crimes , so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn_out to be more symbolism than substance . yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking . senate_republicans , after repeatedly failing_to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation , have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee . the democratic_leadership agreed_to allow a floor vote_on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus_on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing . even some democrats concede_that there_is probably a majority in the senate that favors some_kind of broad capital-punishment measure . the pending bill , introduced by mr. thurmond , would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the supreme_court . in 1972 , the high_court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional . but in 1976 , the court permitted resurrection of such laws , if_they meet certain procedural requirements . for_instance , juries would_have to consider specific `` aggravating '' and `` mitigating '' factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death . since that 1976 ruling , 37 states have reintroduced the death_penalty . but congressional democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level , with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides . the thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes , most of which were formerly punishable_by death under federal statutes that the supreme_court invalidated . among these crimes are murder on federal land , presidential assassination and espionage . the thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable_by death , including murder for hire . -lrb- separately , the senate last_week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill americans abroad . -rrb- amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue , one critical question involves whether a federal death_penalty , on top of existing state laws , would deter any would-be criminals . for one_thing , it 's unlikely that many_people would_receive federal death sentences , let alone be_executed . most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a supreme_court justice , for_instance , or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death . in fact , only 28 defendants would_have been eligible_for federal death sentences if the thurmond bill had_been in effect in the past_three years , according_to a study by the senate_judiciary committee 's democratic staff . the last federal execution before the supreme_court 's 1972 ruling banning the death_penalty took_place in 1963 , meaning that the federal_government did_n't exercise its execution authority for eight_years . `` in that sense , the whole debate is sort of a fraud , '' argues a democratic senate staff member . `` it 's distracting attention from serious issues , like how to make dea , fbi and customs work_together '' on drug enforcement . republicans acknowledge that few people would_be executed under the thurmond bill , but they contend 0 that is n't the point . `` many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many_people from the commission of capital crimes , ''_says sen. orrin hatch -lrb-_r. , utah -rrb- . executions , regardless of how frequently they occur , are also `` proper retribution '' for heinous crimes , mr. hatch argues 0 . thomas boyd , a senior justice_department official , says_0 the new federal drug-related crimes punishable_by death since last november may result in a jump in capital sentences , though that has n't happened so_far . in_addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals , this bill has made race a major part_of the death-penalty debate . before the bill left committee , sen._edward kennedy_-lrb- d. , mass . -rrb- attached an amendment that would_allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner . the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr. thurmond , who complained_that it would `` kill '' capital punishment . a large_number of studies suggest_that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion . and the kennedy amendment would invade not_only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways . it would_allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death_penalty in the past . and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities . `` that burden is very_difficult , if not impossible , 0 to meet , ''_says mr._boyd . `` how do you prove a negative ? '' since most prosecutors would n't be_able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations did_n't affect sentencing , executions everywhere might come to a halt , mr._boyd explains 0 . at_least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death_penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared_with blacks , and against black defendants compared_with white defendants . conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the supreme_court ruled in 1987 that such research , regardless of its accuracy , is n't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence . the kennedy amendment would , in effect , legislate around the supreme_court ruling . lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals , says richard burr , director of the naacp legal defense and educational fund 's capital-punishment defense team . mr. kennedy failed to get his amendment incorporated into last_year 's anti-drug legislation , and it will_be severely attacked on the senate floor this time around . but if it survives , it could prompt other statutory changes , according_to the mr. burr . it might force congress and the states to narrow the death_penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims , perhaps . narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has . and that , in turn , would only strengthen the argument of those_who oppose execution under any circumstances .
