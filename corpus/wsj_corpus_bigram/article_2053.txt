exxon_corp. said_0 it will move its_headquarters from manhattan to dallas . most of the 300 employees at the oil company 's midtown headquarters_building --_including much of senior management -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by chairman lawrence g. rawl . the shift wo_n't affect operations . as_part of its restructuring several_years ago , exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor rockefeller_center skyscraper to a japanese company . but the pullout is an embarrassment to new_york city_officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies . mobil_corp. is in the process of vacating its_headquarters here , and huge operations like j.c._penney &_co. and trans_world airlines have recently left . new_york authorities , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation_'s third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an_opportunity to accommodate it . ``_we are dismayed , but there 's nothing 0 we_can do about it now , '' said stanley grayson , new_york city deputy_mayor for finance and economic_development . meanwhile , dallas welcomed the move . city_officials there had_been were aware that a large company was moving in , but negotiations had all been conducted through a law_firm and under the code name `` everglades . '' `` when we were told 0 it was exxon , it was beyond all expectations ; what a coup , '' said tom lewis , senior_vice president of dallas partnership , the economic_development affiliate of the city 's chamber of commerce . dallas , its economy based_on oil and real_estate , has_been in a slump . exxon said_0 it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old las colinas complex in the suburb of irving . until the building is completed , exxon will rent part_of an existing office tower . las colinas , once a huge texas ranch , is a sprawling complex of office_buildings , homes and recreational facilities that its developers have_been struggling to populate in recent_years . exxon officials said_0 it will cost less to run its_headquarters at las colinas than in new_york . the company wo_n't say how_much it will save , but during at its interim location , sources say_0 it will likely pay rent of $ 10 to $ 15 per square_foot . owners of the building in new_york say_0 they will_be asking $ 50 per square_foot for rent to fill the space that exxon is vacating . in texas , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said_0 . plus , one exxon official said_0 , by eliminating the typically long new_york commutes between office and home , management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in dallas , rather_than a 35-hour work week in new_york .
