when warren winiarski , proprietor of stag 's leap wine cellars in napa valley , announced a $_75 price tag for his 1985 cask 23 cabernet this_fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked . `` this is the peak of my wine-making experience , '' mr. winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in new_york , `` and i wanted to single it out as such . '' it is in my estimation the best wine 0 stag 's leap has produced , and with fewer_than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly . the price is a new high for california cabernet sauvignon , but it is not the highest . diamond creek 1985 lake vineyard cabernet weighed in this_fall with a sticker price of $_100 a bottle . one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -lrb- or so perceived , at any rate -rrb- , and with exceedingly high prices . for years , this group included a stable of classics -- bordeaux first growths -lrb- lafite-rothschild , latour , haut-brion , petrus -rrb- , grand cru burgundies -lrb- romanee-conti and la tache -rrb- deluxe champagnes -lrb- dom perignon or roederer cristal -rrb- , rarefied sweet wines -lrb- chateau yquem or trockenbeerenauslesen rieslings from germany , and biondi-santi brunello riserva from tuscany -rrb- . these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $_40 to $_125 a bottle . in the last_year or so , however , this exclusive club has_taken in a host of flashy new members . the classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come_up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe . france can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles . bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -lrb- except_for the smallest in terms of production , chateau petrus , which costs around $_250 ! -rrb- . these prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other french wines from current vintages . chateau yquem , the leading sauternes , now goes for well over $_100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 . in champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $_100 a bottle . the first champagne 0 to crack that price barrier was the 1979 salon de mesnil blanc de blancs . the '82 salon is $_115 . roederer cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and taittinger 's comtes de champagne blanc de blancs is encroaching upon that level . the great reds of the rhone valley have soared in price as_well . e. guigal 's 1982 cote rotie la landonne , for_example , is $ 120 . none of france_'s wine regions can steal a march on burgundy , however . the six wines of the domaine de la romanee-conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several_years now . with the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : la tache , $ 195 ; richebourg , $ 180 ; romanee-conti , $_225 . another small burgundy estate , coche-dury , has just offered its 1987 corton-charlemagne for $_155 . from italy there_is angelo gaja barbaresco at $_125 a bottle , piero antinori 's la solaia , a $ 90 cabernet from tuscany , and biondi-santi brunello at $ 98 . spain 's vega secilia unico 1979 -lrb- released only in its 10th year -rrb- is $_70 , as is australia 's grange hermitage 1982 . `` there_are certain cult wines that can command these higher_prices , ''_says larry shapiro of marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in dallas . `` what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out . we_'re seeing it partly_because older vintages are growing more scarce . '' wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , mr. shapiro continued : 0 ``_we 've_seen a dramatic decrease in demand_for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $_300 to $_400 a bottle . some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $_100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . '' take lake vineyard cabernet from diamond creek . it 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -lrb- the last was 1979 -rrb- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 . owner al brownstein originally_planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in southern_california asked , `` is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter . offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -lrb- $_100 retail -rrb- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -rrb- no , the wine is too_high -lrb- 2 responses -rrb- ; 2 -rrb- yes , it 's high but i_'ll take it -lrb- 2 responses -rrb- ; 3 -rrb- i_'ll take all 0 i can_get -lrb- 58 responses -rrb- . the wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going_to 62 retailers in 28 states . ``_we thought_0 it was awfully expensive , '' said sterling pratt , wine director at schaefer 's in skokie , ill. , one of the top stores in suburban chicago , `` but there_are people out there with very different opinions of value . we got our two six-packs -- and they_'re gone . '' mr. pratt remarked that he_thinks 0 steeper prices have come about because producers do_n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on . even_if there_is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move . `` there may_be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said mr. pratt , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide 0 it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . '' `` it 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people , '' added larry shapiro . `` they like to talk_about having the new red rock terrace -lcb- one of diamond creek 's cabernets -rcb- or the dunn 1985 cabernet , or the petrus . producers have seen this market opening up and they_'re now creating wines that appeal to these people . '' that explains why the number_of these wines is expanding so rapidly . but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they_were a few_years ago . `` they wo_n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said cedric martin of martin wine cellar in new_orleans . `` or if_they feel 0 the wine is overpriced and 0 they_can get something equally good for less . '' mr. martin has increased prices on some wines -lrb- like grgich hills chardonnay , now $_32 -rrb- just to slow_down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red burgundies and cabernets and chardonnays in the $ 30 to $_40 range . image has , of course , a great_deal 0 to do with what sells and what does_n't , and it ca_n't be_forced . wine merchants ca_n't keep roederer cristal in stock , but they have to push salon le mesnil , even lowering the price from $_115 to $ 90 . it 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 salon is a beautiful wine , but , as mr. pratt noted 0 , people have their_own ideas about value . it 's interesting to find that a_lot of the expensive wines are n't_always walking out the door . in every major market in the u.s. , for_instance , you_can buy '86 la tache or richebourg , virtually_all of the first growth bordeaux -lrb- except petrus -rrb- , as_well as opus one and dominus from california and , at the moment , the stag 's leap 1985 cask 23 . with the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will_be interesting to see_how the superpremiums fare . by january it should_be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not . ms. ensrud is a free-lance wine writer in new_york .
