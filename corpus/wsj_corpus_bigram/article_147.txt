despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last_year . the previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according_to the agriculture_department . net cash income -- the amount left in farmers_' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's economic research service reported 0 yesterday . most of those states set farm income records . the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains . what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large_quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs . with prices soaring , they_were able_to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240-page report said_0 . in less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher_prices . to the surprise of some_analysts , net cash income_rose in some of the hardest-hit states , including indiana , illinois , nebraska and the dakotas . analysts attributed the increases partly to the $_4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by congress . last_year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early_1980s . it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next_year . commodity prices have_been rising in recent_years , with the farm price_index hitting record peaks earlier_this year , as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses . at the same_time , export demand_for u.s. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said keith collins , a department analyst . farmers also benefited_from strong livestock prices , as the nation_'s cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low . `` all of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' mr. collins said . california led the nation with $ 6.5_billion in net cash income last_year , followed_by texas , $_3.9 billion ; iowa , $_3.4 billion ; florida , $_3.1 billion ; and minnesota , $_2.7 billion . iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states 0 to log a decline in net cash income . despite federal disaster_relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an_estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according_to the department . many lost their farms . department economists do_n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was . indeed , net cash income is_likely to fall this_year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline . at the same_time , an_increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has_been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the soviets . last_year , government payments to farmers slipped to less_than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 . payments are_expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this_year .
