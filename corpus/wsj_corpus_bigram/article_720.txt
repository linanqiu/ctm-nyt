slowing sales of its profitable jeep cherokee and wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing chrysler_corp. to temporarily idle its toledo , ohio , assembly_plant for the first_time since_april 1986 . about 5,500 hourly workers will_be laid off for a week beginning oct._23 , and overtime has_been eliminated at the plant for the fourth_quarter , a chrysler spokesman_said 0 . that 's a significant change from earlier_this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company 's bullish expectations . sales of cherokee , the best-selling jeep , and the lower-volume wagoneer were actually up about 10_% through the end of last_month . but that 's less_than chrysler officials had_hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the toledo plant earlier_this year . even when it became_clear this spring that demand was n't coming up to expectations , chrysler officials `` resisted '' cutting output because cherokee and wagoneer are `` very profitable vehicles , '' the spokesman_said 0 . instead , chrysler officials in late may slapped $_1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles , including the first such incentives on the popular four-door cherokee since chrysler bought jeep in 1987 . the incentives boosted sales for a while , but the pace had cooled by last_month . the result : chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the cherokee as of the end of last_month and a 161-day supply of the comanche pickup , which toledo also builds . a 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal . at jasper jeep-eagle , one of the largest jeep dealerships in the country , inventories have continued to swell . steve lowe , general_manager of jasper , ga. , dealership , said_0 new rebates of $_500 to $_1,000 on the models have stimulated sales , but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks . `` if people are n't buying , you have to close plants , '' he said . separately , chrysler said_0 it will idle for four weeks the st._louis assembly_plant that builds the chrysler lebaron and dodge daytona models . chrysler officials said_0 the plant is_scheduled to resume production on nov. 20. , and 3,300 hourly workers will_be affected . general_motors corp. , meanwhile , said_0 it will idle for yet_another week its linden , n.j. , assembly_plant , bringing to three_weeks the total time 0 that plant will_be idled during october . gm said_0 the assembly_plant , which builds the chevrolet corsica and beretta compact cars , originally was scheduled to reopen monday but now will not resume production until oct._30 . the shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars . sluggish sales of the beretta and corsica spurred gm to offer $_800 rebates on those cars . the corsica and beretta make up the highest-volume car line at chevrolet , but sales of the cars are off 9.6_% for the year , and fell a steep 34.2 % early this_month . gm has scheduled overtime at its lordstown , ohio , and janesville , wis. , assembly_plants , which build the chevrolet cavalier . ford_motor co. said_0 it will shut_down for one week its kentucky truck plant because of a `` shortage of dealer orders .
