for the moment , at_least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on_wall street . the dow_jones industrial_average jumped sharply yesterday to close_at 2657.38 , panic did_n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept friday_'s dizzying 190-point_plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity . many went bargain-hunting . among those sighing with relief was john_h. gutfreund , chairman of salomon_brothers , who_took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events . as the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped stanley shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back . at first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . as trading opened yesterday_morning on the big_board , stocks of many of the nation_'s biggest companies could_n't open for trading because a wave of sell_orders was overwhelming buyers . by 10:10 , the dow_industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of ual_corp. , whose troubles had kicked off friday_'s plunge , still had n't opened . but then , as quickly as the dow had_fallen , it began to turn around . it ended with a gain of 88.12 points . by the market 's close , volume on the new_york exchange totaled more_than 416 million , the fourth highest on record . the big_board handled the huge volume without_any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to black_monday of 1987 . but the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip_stocks , which had_been hard hit during friday_'s selling frenzy . overall , more big_board stocks lost money than gained . and many arbitragers , already reeling from friday_'s collapse of the ual_deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of amr_corp. , the parent of american_airlines , collapsed . indeed , the dow_jones transportation average_plunged 102.06 points , its second-worst drop in history . world-wide , trading was generally manageable . the frankfurt stock_exchange was hardest_hit of the major markets , with blue_chips there falling 12.8_% . in london , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2_% , and tokyo 's leading stock index_fell only 1.8_% in surprisingly lackluster trading . other , more thinly traded asian markets were hit harder than tokyo 's , but there_were no free-fall declines . investors big and small say_0 they learned valuable lessons since the 1987_crash : in this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few_hours ' time must_be expected . what 's more , such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling . stephen_boesel , a major money_manager for t._rowe price in baltimore , says , `` there was less panic than in 1987 : we had_been through it once . '' in somerset , wis. , adrian sween , who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock_market , agrees . ``_i look_at it as a ho-hum matter , '' he_says . many other_factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . the federal_reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest_rate on its loans to major_banks inched downward early in the day . foreign stock_markets , which kicked off black_monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . the dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced_back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload u.s. stocks . and the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors . many major institutions , for_example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue_chips 0 they felt 0 had_been sharply undervalued on friday . still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there_is nothing present in the current market system 0 to prevent another dizzying drop such_as friday_'s . `` there_is too_much complacency , ''_says money_manager barry schrager . computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe . so investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in tokyo , where the nikkei average of 225 blue-chip_stocks got off to a rocky start . the average_plunged some 600 points , or 1.7_% , in the first 20_minutes of trading . but the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 . unlike two_years ago , most of japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out . in merrill_lynch &_co. 's tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process . clients `` are all staying out '' of the market , one merrill trader says_0 . the relative calm in tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in europe . frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half_hour because of a crush of sell_orders . `` the beginning was chaotic , ''_says nigel longley , a broker for commerzbank in london , the view from the trading floor of an american securities_firm , jefferies &_co. , also was troubling . a computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip_stocks colors each one red when its price is falling . the screen was a sea of red . ``_i see concern , but i_do n't see panic , ''_says j. francis palamara , a new_yorker who_runs the 15-trader office . london 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . new_york time , sending an encouraging message to wall_street . when trading opened in new_york at 9:30 a.m._edt , stocks fell_sharply -- as expected . futures_markets in chicago had opened at a level suggesting 0 the dow would fall by about 60_points . with sell_orders piled up from friday , about_half the stocks in the dow could_n't open on time . by 9:45 , the industrial_average had dropped 27 points . by 10_a.m. , it was down 49 . ten minutes later , the dow hit_bottom - down 63.52 points , another 2.5_% . but shortly_before then , some of wall_street 's sharpest traders_say , 0 they sensed a turn . `` the first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was 0 treasury_bonds were off , ''_says austin george , head of stock trading at t._rowe price . `` it meant that people were n't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds . '' shortly_after 10_a.m. , the major market index , a chicago_board of trade futures_contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the djia , exploded upward . stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the mmi had also started the recovery in stocks on the tuesday following black_monday . `` the mmi has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the london office of shearson_lehman hutton . shearson 's london trading room went wild . traders shouted out as their reuters , quotron and telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on_wall street . then , nine minutes later , wall_street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . `` rally , rally , rally , '' shouted shearson 's andy rosen . `` this is panic buying . '' major blue-chip_stocks like philip_morris , general_motors and proctor &_gamble led the rally . japanese were said to be heavy buyers . german and dutch investors reportedly loaded up on kellogg co . then , traders_say 0 , corporations with share_buy-back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among_other issues , alcan aluminium and mcdonald_'s . walt_disney co. , which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at 114.5 , down 8.5 . but then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as goldman , sachs_& co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders_said 0 . by 10:25 , the dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . among big_board specialists , the cry was `` pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher_prices for their shares . `` it was bedlam on the upside , '' said one big_board specialist . `` what we had was a real , old-fashioned rally . '' this technical strength spurred buying from wall_street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods . typical , perhaps , was batterymarch 's dean lebaron . mr. lebaron , who_manages $ 10 billion , says , ``_we turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . '' asked what stocks the computer bought , the money_manager says , ``_i do_n't know . '' not everybody was making money . the carnage on the chicago_board options_exchange , the nation_'s major options market , was heavy after the trading in s&p_100 stock-index options was_halted friday . many market_makers in the s&p_100 index options contract had bullish positions friday , and when the shutdown came they_were frozen with huge_losses . over the weekend , clearing firms told the chicago market_makers to get_out of their positions at any cost monday_morning . `` they_were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one chicago-based options trader . meanwhile , a test of the stock_market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day . charles clough , a strategist_at merrill_lynch , says_0 bargain hunting had explained the dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the dow . moreover , the announcement that real_estate magnate and sometime raider donald_trump was withdrawing his offer for amr_corp. might_have been expected to rattle traders . instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying . the market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of across the country , many_people took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock_market in general . says james norman , the mayor of ava , mo. : ``_i do_n't invest in stocks . i much prefer money 0 i can put my hands on . '' while mayor norman found the market 's performance monday reassuring , he_says 0 , he remains uneasy . ``_we have half the experts saying one_thing and half the other '' about the course of the economy . ralph holzfaster , a farmer and farm-supply store operator in ogallala , neb. , says of the last few_days events , `` if anything good comes out of this , it might_be that it puts some of these lbos on the skids . ''_says gordon fines , a money_manager at ids financial_services in minneapolis , `` you_'re on a roller coaster , and that may last . the public is still cautious .
