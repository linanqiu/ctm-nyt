in the wake_of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock_market , and a string of problematic economic_indicators , british chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson promised gradual improvement in the u.k. economy . in a speech prepared for_delivery to london 's financial_community , mr._lawson summed up current economic_policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the british economy , using high_interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' 0 to carry_out the campaign . two_weeks after boosting base rates to 15_% , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time 0 to come . '' mr._lawson also made it clear that he would_be watching exchange_rates carefully . a sinking pound makes imports more_expensive and increases businesses '_expectations of future inflation , he argued 0 . in an_apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the british currency , he stated that the exchange_rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . '' in reaffirming the current monetary_policy of using high_interest rates to fight inflation and shore_up the pound , mr._lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . he said_0 he monitors the money-supply figures , but does_n't give_them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested 0 . mr._lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on britain_'s financial system . mr._lawson 's speech , delivered at the lord mayor of london 's annual dinner at mansion house , came on the heels of a grueling period for the u.k. economy . two_weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage_point to 15_% . despite the increase , the british currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last_week . it was_quoted at 2.9428 marks in late new_york trading wednesday . leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting_that the british war on inflation will_be more bruising than previously assumed . unemployment in_september dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest_level since_1980 . while lower joblessness is generally good_news , the hefty drop last_month indicates_that the economy is n't slowing down as_much as hoped 0 -- despite a doubling of interest_rates over the last 16 months . meanwhile , average earnings in britain were up 8.75_% in_august over the previous_year . another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record # 10.2 billion -lrb- $ 16.22 billion -rrb- last_month , a much higher level than economists had predicted . in a separate speech prepared for_delivery at the dinner , robin leigh-pemberton , bank of england governor , conceded_that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had_been appreciated '' when the british economy was heating up last_year . he_added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said_0 `` tight monetary_policy is the right approach . '' discussing the recent slide in stock_prices , the central_bank governor stated that `` the markets now appear to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of the 190.58-point_plunge in the dow_jones industrial_average a week ago . although the new_york market_plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the london financial_times-stock exchange 100 share index , mr. leigh-pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the british economy . '' specifically , he pointed_out that compared_with the u.s. market , the u.k. has far fewer highly_leveraged junk-bond financings . discussing future monetary arrangements , mr._lawson repeated the thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange_rate mechanism of the european_monetary system , but he did_n't indicate when .
