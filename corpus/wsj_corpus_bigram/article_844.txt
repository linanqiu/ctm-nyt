part_of a series -rcb- betty lombardi is a mild-mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural hunterdon county , n.j . but put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless . if colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money-saving coupon , she 'll cross crest off her shopping list without a second thought . never mind that her_husband prefers crest . some weeks when her supermarket runs a double-coupon promotion , she boasts that she shaves $ 22 off her bill . money is n't the only_thing that makes her dump once favorite brands . after she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies , she dropped pepperidge farm and started buying brands free of such oils . ``_i always thought_0 pepperidge farm was tasty and high quality , '' mrs. lombardi says . `` but i_do n't_want any of that oil for my grandkids . '' -lrb- pepperidge farm says_0 it ca_n't tell exactly how_many customers it has lost , but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end . -rrb- clearly , people like mrs. lombardi are giving marketers fits . she represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices , nutritional and environmental concerns , and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand_loyalty . while brand_loyalty is far from dead , marketing experts_say 0 it has eroded during the 1980s . marketers themselves are partly to blame : they_'ve increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising . what 's more , a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands , many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other . `` marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use '' of promotions , contends_0 joe plummer , an executive_vice president at the d'arcy masius benton & bowles ad_agency . `` without some real product improvements , it 's going_to be difficult to win that loyalty back . '' the wall_street journal 's `` american way of buying '' survey this_year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products 0 they use . for the survey , peter_d. hart_research associates asked some 2,000 consumers , including mrs. lombardi , whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand_loyalty . more_than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said_0 they_'re brand switchers . overall , 12_% of consumers are n't brand_loyal for any of the 25 product categories . about 47_% are loyal for one to five of the products . only 2_% are brand_loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories , and no_one is loyal for more_than 20 types_of products . for such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes , devotion to a single brand was quite low , with fewer_than 30_% saying_0 they usually buy the same brand . only for cigarettes , mayonnaise and toothpaste did more_than 60_% of users say_0 they typically stick with the same brand . people tend_to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive flavors , such_as cigarettes and ketchup . kathie huff , a respondent in the journal_survey from spokane , wash. , says_0 her_husband is adamant about eating only hunt 's ketchup . he simply ca_n't stomach the taste of heinz , she_says 0 . the 31-year-old homemaker adds , `` the only other thing 0 i_'m really loyal to is my virginia slims cigarettes . coke and pepsi are all the same to me , and i usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale . '' brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes , perfume and beer . people often stay with a particular brand because_they want to be associated_with the image 0 its advertising conveys , whether that 's macho marlboro cigarettes or cher 's uninhibited perfume . loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries . only 23_% of trash-bag users in the journal_survey usually buy the same brand , and just 29 % of battery buyers stick to one brand . underwear scored a middling 36_% in brand_loyalty , but consumer researchers_say 0 that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product . `` in the past , you just wore fruit of the loom and did_n't care , ''_says peter kim , u.s. director of consumer behavior research for the j._walter thompson ad_agency . `` the high score reflects the attempts_to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both_men and women . '' he_believes 0 there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty . what loyalty 0 there_is to gas brands , he_believes 0 , is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations . brand_loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the journal_survey . nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand_loyalty for more_than 10 of the 25 products in the survey ; only 9_% of those age_18 to 29 have such strong allegiance . higher-income people also tend_to be more brand_loyal these_days , the journal_survey and other research studies indicate 0 . marketers speculate that more affluent people tend_to lead more pressured lives and do_n't have time 0 to research the products 0 they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price . an established brand name is insurance that at_least the product will_be of acceptable quality , if not always the best value for the money . it 's sort of loyalty by default . meanwhile , `` the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal , ''_says 0 laurel cutler , vice_chairman of the ad_agency fcb\/leber katz partners . `` they_'re buying whatever 's cheaper . '' the biggest wild card in the brand_loyalty game : how those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby_boomers will behave as they move into middle age . they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have_shown less allegiance so_far . but now that they_'re settling down and raising families , might they also show more stability in their brand choices ? mr. kim of j._walter thompson does_n't think so . he_believes 0 baby_boomers will_continue to be selective in their brand loyalties . `` earlier generations were brand_loyal across categories , '' he_says , `` but boomers tend_to be brand_loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water , but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances . '' while not as brand_loyal as in the past , consumers today do_n't buy products capriciously , either . rather , they tend_to have a set of two or three favorites . sometimes , they_'ll choose ragu spaghetti sauce ; other times , it will_be prego . advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands . if a more absorbent pampers hits the market , you_can be_sure 0 a new and improved huggies wo_n't be far behind . the bbdo worldwide ad_agency studied `` brand parity '' and found that consumers believe_0 all brands are about the same in a number_of categories , particularly credit_cards , paper towels , dry soups and snack chips . `` when there 's a clutter of brands , consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves , ` all brands are the same so what difference does it make which i buy , ' ''_says karen olshan , a senior_vice president at bbdo . `` too often , advertising imagery has n't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer . '' but given such strong brand disloyalty , some marketers are putting renewed emphasis_on image advertising . a small but growing_number of companies are also trying_to instill more fervent brand_loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs , magazines and membership clubs for brand users . while discount promotions are essential for most brands , some companies concede 0 they went overboard in shifting money from advertising to coupons , refunds and other sales incentives . some people argue_that strong brands can_afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds_of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years . but most companies are too afraid to take that chance . and perhaps with good reason . says clayt wilhite , president of the d'arcy masius ad_agency 's u.s. division , `` every time 0 24_hours pass without_any advertising reinforcement , brand_loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like budweiser . '' consider , for_example , what_happened to maxwell house coffee . the kraft_general foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave_up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business . but since returning to advertising , maxwell house has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival folgers . `` now , philip_morris -lcb- kraft_general foods ' parent_company -rcb- is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for maxwell house , ''_says dick mayer , president of the general_foods usa division . `` even_though brand_loyalty is rather strong for coffee , we_need advertising to maintain and strengthen it . '' campbell_soup co. , for one , has concluded_that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people_who buy competitive brands . `` the probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000 , ''_says tony adams , the company 's vice_president for marketing research . `` the best odds are with your core franchise . our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week , and we_'d like to increase that . '' so campbell is talking to its `` brand enthusiasts , '' probing their psychological attachment to its soup . in one consumer focus group , a fan declared that , `` campbell 's soup is like getting a hug from a friend . '' that helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising slogan : `` a warm hug from campbell 's . ''
