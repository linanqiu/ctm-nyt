the treasury_department proposed that banks be_required to_keep detailed records of international wire transfers , which officials believe_0 is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the u.s. . in recent testimony on_capitol hill , treasury officials said_0 they_were considering the new reporting requirements , and the expected publication of the proposal in the federal register today is the first official step_toward creating final regulations . the treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government_agencies that have a hand in fighting money laundering . among the possibilities 0 the treasury is_considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers . another suggestion would draw banks more directly into tracking down money launderers by developing a `` suspicious international wire transfer profile , '' which banks would use to spotlight questionable payments . but banks may prefer using a profile that targets selected transactions , rather_than a blanket reporting requirement . banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $_10,000 or more . but wire transfers from a standing account --_including those bigger than $_10,000 -- are n't reported . officials believe_0 this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting . authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the u.s. total about $_110 billion annually . sen. john kerry -lrb-_d. , mass._-rrb- , chairman of a senate foreign_relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering , criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on u.s. wire systems . the american bankers_association did_n't have any comment_on the plan . the proposal now enters a 60-day comment period , after which the treasury will propose final regulations , followed_by another comment period .
