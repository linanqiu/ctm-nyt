from the sept. 30-oct . 4 issue of the economist : what defeated general aoun was not_only the weight of the syrian army . the weight of lebanon 's history was also against_him ; and it is a history 0 israel is in danger of repeating . like lebanon , and however unfairly , israel is regarded by the arab world as a colonial aberration . its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the palestinians . like lebanon , israel is being remade by demography . in greater israel more_than half the children under six are muslims . within 25 years jews will_probably be the minority . yet israel will neither share power with all these arabs nor , says_0 its present prime_minister , redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 jewish heartland . by not choosing one of these options , israelis will condemn themselves , as the maronites did , to perpetual war with the muslims in their midst , and so to the internal erosion of their state . unlike the maronites , israel 's jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies ; jerusalem will_become belfast before it becomes beirut . but that is not much of a consolation 0 to draw from the failure of general aoun .
