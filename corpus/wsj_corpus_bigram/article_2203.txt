investors unsettled by the stock_market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly_dividend checks . that has_been particularly true this_year with many companies raising their payouts more_than 10_% . but do_n't breathe too easy : those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock_prices , some_analysts warn 0 . in the past , they say_0 , the strongest dividend_growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over . that can_be a trap for unwary investors , says_0 richard bernstein , senior quantitative analyst_at merrill_lynch &_co . strong dividend_growth , he_says 0 , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating . stephen_boesel , president of t._rowe price growth and income fund , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate_profits have_been growing for some time . `` invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' he_says . `` and recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock_market . '' indeed , analysts_say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks . in 1976 , for_example , dividends on the stocks in standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index soared 10_% , following much slower growth the year before . the s&p index started sliding in price in_september 1976 , and fell 12_% in 1977 -- despite a 15_% expansion in dividends that year . that pattern has n't_always held , but recent strong_growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious . payouts on the s&p_500 stocks rose 10_% in 1988 , according_to standard_& poor_'s corp. , and wall_street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9_% and 14_% . many_people believe_0 the growth in dividends will slow next_year , although a minority see double-digit gains continuing . meanwhile , many market watchers say_0 recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : while dividends have_risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock_prices . as a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards . put another way , the decline in the yield suggests 0 stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends 0 they pay , some market analysts_say 0 . they_are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p_500 . the figure is currently about 3.3_% , up from 3.2_% before the recent market slide . some_analysts say_0 investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3_% . a drop below that 3_% benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , ''_says 0 mr. boesel of t._rowe price . in fact , `` the market has always tanked . always . there 's never been an exception , ''_says 0 gerald w. perritt , a chicago investment_adviser and money_manager , based_on a review of six decades of stock-market data . the last time 0 the s&p_500 yield dropped below 3_% was in the summer of 1987 . stockholders who_took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle . there have_been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the s&p_500 dropped below 3_% for at_least two consecutive months , mr. perritt found 0 . and in each case , he_says 0 , a sharp_drop in stock_prices began within a year . still , some market analysts_say 0 the current 3.3_% reading is n't as troublesome as it might_have been in years past . `` it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , ''_says james h. coxon , head of stock investments for cigna_corp. , the philadelphia-based insurer . in particular , mr. coxon says_0 , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash_flow in the form of dividends than they have historically . so , while stock_prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they_are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength . rather_than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy_back some of their shares , notes 0 steven g. einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at goldman , sachs_& co . he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6_% . that is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he_says 0 . what will happen to dividend_growth next_year ? common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate_profits . painewebber_inc. , for_instance , is forecasting growth in s&p_500 dividends of just under 5_% in 1990 , down from an_estimated 11_% this_year . in other years in which there have_been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment 0 the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged_from a gain of 4_% to a decline of 1 % , according_to painewebber analyst thomas doerflinger . the minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around 0 to declare sharply_higher dividends even_if their earnings weaken . dividend_growth on the order of 12_% is_expected by both mr. coxon of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman_sachs . those dividend bulls argue_that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty_of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures . one indicator 0 investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard_& poor_'s of the number_of public companies adjusting their dividends . a total of 139 companies raised dividends in october , basically unchanged from 138 a year_ago , s&p said_0 wednesday . that followed four straight months in which the number_of increases trailed the year-earlier pace . while the s&p tally does_n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number_of dividend increases could_be a harbinger of slower dividend_growth next_year . in any_case , opinion is mixed on how_much of a boost the overall stock_market would get even_if dividend_growth continues at double-digit levels . mr. einhorn of goldman_sachs estimates 0 the stock_market will deliver a 12_% to 15_% total_return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12_months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7_% or 8_% if dividend_growth is weak . but mr. boesel of t._rowe price , who also expects 12_% growth in dividends next_year , does_n't think_0 it will_help the overall market all that much . `` having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but i_do n't_think 0 it 's a main consideration , '' he_says . with slower economic_growth and flat corporate earnings likely next_year , ``_i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current_levels .
