pick a country , any country . it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall_street : a rash of new closed-end country_funds , those publicly_traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country . no fewer_than 24 country_funds have_been launched or registered with regulators this_year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according_to charles e. simon &_co. , a washington-based research_firm . the turf recently has ranged_from chile to austria to portugal . next_week , the philippine fund 's launch will_be capped by a visit by philippine president corazon aquino -- the first_time 0 a head of state has kicked off an issue at the big_board here . the next province ? `` anything 's possible -- how about the new guinea fund ? '' quips george foot , a managing_partner at newgate management associates of northampton , mass . the recent explosion of country_funds mirrors the `` closed-end fund mania '' of the 1920s , mr. foot says_0 , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular . they fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash . unlike traditional open-end mutual_funds , most of these one-country portfolios are the `` closed-end '' type , issuing a fixed number_of shares that trade publicly . the surge brings to nearly 50 the number_of country_funds that are or soon will_be listed in new_york or london . these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets . `` people are_looking to stake their claims '' now before the number_of available nations runs out , says_michael porter , an_analyst at smith_barney , harris_upham &_co. , new_york . behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition . as individual_investors have turned away_from the stock_market over the years , securities_firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy 0 to sell . and the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it . financial_planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities . and many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such_as the u.s. and japan . country_funds offer an easy way_0 to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies . but it_does n't take much to get burned . political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds . another concern : the funds ' share prices tend_to swing more_than the broader market . when the stock_market dropped nearly 7_% oct._13 , for_instance , the mexico fund plunged about 18_% and the spain fund fell 16_% . and most country_funds were clobbered more_than most stocks after the 1987_crash . what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right_now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios . after trading at an_average discount of more_than 20_% in late 1987 and part_of last_year , country_funds currently trade at an_average premium of 6_% . the reason_: share prices of many of these funds this_year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks 0 they hold . it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign_investors , such_as south_korea , some specialists say_0 . but some european funds recently have skyrocketed ; spain fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium . it has_been targeted by japanese_investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992 's european economic integration . and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums . ``_i 'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations , ''_says smith_barney 's mr. porter . the newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country_funds , mr. porter suggests 0 . unlike many u.s. investors , those in asia or europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may_be less resistant to paying higher_prices for country_funds . `` there may_be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here , '' mr. porter says . nonetheless , plenty_of u.s. analysts and money_managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country_funds . they_argue that u.s. investors often can buy american_depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s. . that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium . for people_who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds , newgate 's mr. foot says : `` the only advice 0 i have for these folks is that those_who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly .
