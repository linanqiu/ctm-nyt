british_airways plc said_0 it is_seeking improved terms and a sharply_lower price in any revised_bid for united_airlines parent_ual corp. following the collapse of a $_6.79 billion , $_300-a-share buy-out_bid . derek stevens , british_air 's chief_financial officer , told dow_jones professional_investor report 0 a price of $ 230 a_share is `` certainly_not too_low , '' and indicated 0 his company would like to reduce the size of its $_750 million cash investment . he_added 0 the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid , and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed . ``_we 're in no_way committed to a deal going through at all . we_'re not rushing into anything . we_do n't_want to be party to a second rejection , '' he said , adding_that coming up with a revised offer could_easily take several_weeks . mr._stevens 's remarks , confirming a report in the wall_street journal that british_air wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation_'s second-largest airline , helped push ual_stock lower for the fourth straight day . ual fell $ 6.25 a_share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3_million shares in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange as concern deepened among takeover_stock traders about the length of time 0 it will_take to revive the purchase . under the original buy-out approved_by the ual_board sept. 14 , ual 's pilots planned to put_up $_200 million in cash and make $_200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75_% stake . ual management was to pay $ 15 million for 10_% , and british_air was to receive a 15_% stake . the buy-out fell through when citicorp and chase_manhattan corp. unexpectedly failed to_obtain bank_financing . since_then , ual_stock has_fallen 33_% in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover_stock ever . the tenor of mr._stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that british_air will_take a more active , high-profile role in pursuing any new bid . he said_0 he_believes 0 ual management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction . mr._stevens said_0 british_air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management_group , led_by ual chairman_stephen wolf , and has n't received any indication of when one might_be forthcoming . `` as far as we_'re concerned , we_'re waiting_for the dust to_settle , '' he said . although british_air is waiting to see what the buy-out_group comes up with , mr._stevens said_0 a revised transaction with less debt leverage is_likely to be more_attractive to banks . he said_0 the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in ual 's market price , the amount of debt 0 banks are willing_to fund , and the price 0 british_air would_be willing_to pay . mr._stevens said_0 he_expects 0 the new price will_be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure . asked_whether a $ 230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too_low , he said , `` it 's certainly_not too_low . '' he_added 0 the original offer was `` a pretty full price , '' and that british_air 's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us . '' british_air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15_% stake_in the company , but was n't particularly happy with paying $_750 million . `` if the -lcb- new -rcb- deal had us putting up less money but still having 15_% , that would_be a point in our favor , '' he said . in any new proposal , british_air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal . in the event that the buy-out_group stalls in reviving its bid , the ual_board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction , even without_any legal obligation to do_so . roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover_stock traders , who could vote to oust the board if_they become impatient . meanwhile , the buy-out_group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together , in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups , has_been further complicated by an_apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot_union itself . a pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during united 's 1985 strike filed_suit friday in chicago federal_court to block the takeover . the dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority . ual 's management agreed_to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the united pilot_union for the buy-out proposal . the 220 pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union . the airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union_members in seniority following the 1985 strike , a move 0 the union had contested in a previous lawsuit . judith valente contributed_to this_article .
