environmental concerns are beginning to have as_much influence in oil-industry spending plans as the price of crude does . in the wake_of the exxon valdez spill in march , new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in alaska . at the same_time , moves toward tighter air-quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do_n't pollute as_much as fuel refined from `` heavy '' crudes , generally high in sulfur . over the years , the world 's stream of oil has_been growing heavier . so the scramble is on for lighter crudes globally , and for natural_gas in the u.s. . recently saudi_arabia and venezuela , traditional heavy-crude producers , have boasted of new finds of light , low-sulfur oil by their national oil_companies . venezuela has also earmarked $_200 million in new money for light-crude exploration . and some oil_companies are trying_to lock in future supplies . typical is ente nazionale idrocarburi , italy_'s state-owned energy company , which not long ago acquired through its agip oil subsidiary a 5_% share in the consortium accounting for half of nigeria 's oil output . agip already_has an oil stake_in libya . both countries produce high-quality , low-sulfur crudes especially suited to making high-octane motor fuel at minimum refining cost . franco reviglio , eni chairman , looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry -- he calls it a `` revolution '' requiring huge investments -- as a result of environmental issues . he made a special trip to examine u.s. environmental trends because_they are often followed in europe . eni needs to know_what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $_1.3 billion on upgrading its refineries , he_says 0 . oil_companies world-wide will have `` to spend a_lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will_be required , ''_says 0 john_h. lichtblau , the president of the petroleum industry research foundation . it will_go for work ranging_from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system , including the way_0 service stations pump fuel into cars . in the u.s. , the search_for oil had_been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves . alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge alone is thought to hide more_than three billion barrels of oil . until the tanker spill , big oil was slowly convincing authorities 0 it could safely produce from such places . now the wildlife refuge has_been closed to the industry , possibly for years . similarly , a group of companies led_by chevron_corp. has_been unable_to pump oil found off the california coast in the early_1980s . a huge production system built in the sea off santa barbara and ashore is sitting idle . but the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural_gas . more_than half the domestic drilling now under_way is for gas , partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to burn than either oil or coal . activity has revived in the largest u.s. gas-producing regions , such_as the gulf of mexico . santa_fe international corp. , which is owned_by kuwait -lrb- and is n't related to santa_fe southern_pacific 's unit -rrb- , is stepping_up development of a well off texas ' matagorda island where it found gas in 1987 . ``_we could have sat on it longer , but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace , ''_says richard poole , senior scout for santa_fe international . ``_we 're trying_to get it on line as_soon as possible now . '' this_month , exxon_corp. announced_plans for a 400-day project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the anadarko basin of western oklahoma -- the deepest drilling project in the u.s. . exxon will use a parker drilling co. rig built in 1981 that can_go down 9_1\/2 miles .
