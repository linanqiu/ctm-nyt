ripples from the strike by 55,000 machinists_union members against boeing_co. reached air carriers friday as america_west airlines announced 0 it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker . peter otradovec , vice_president for planning at the phoenix , ariz. , carrier , said in an_interview that the work stoppage at boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more_than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of houston on america_west would now be put on other airlines . mr. otradovec said_0 boeing told america_west that the 757 0 it was supposed_to get this thursday would n't be_delivered until nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had_been planning to initiate service at houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to phoenix and one nonstop to las_vegas . now , those routes are n't expected to begin until jan . boeing is also supposed_to send to america_west another 757 twin-engine aircraft as_well as a 737 by year 's end . those , too , are almost_certain to arrive late . at this point , no other america_west flights --_including its new service at san_antonio , texas ; newark , n.j. ; and palmdale , calif. -- have_been affected_by the delays in boeing deliveries . nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such_as boeing can have on other_parts of the economy . it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure_on the company . ``_i just do_n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' tom baker , president of machinists_' district 751 , said in an_interview yesterday . ``_i do_n't think_0 their customers would like it very_much . '' america_west , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected_by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would_be . ``_i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , 0 they might_not miss one at all , '' mr. otradovec said . indeed , a random check friday did_n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect_on other airline operations . southwest airlines has a boeing 737-300 set for_delivery at the end of this_month and expects to have the plane on time . `` it 's so close to completion , 0 boeing 's told us 0 there wo_n't be a problem , '' said a southwest spokesman . a spokesman for amr_corp. said_0 boeing has assured american_airlines 0 it will deliver a 757 on time later_this month . american is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early december and 20 more next_year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable . in seattle , a boeing spokesman explained that the company has_been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might_be triggered_by the strike . meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have_been trying_to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's everett , wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout . as of friday , four had_been delivered and a fifth plane , a 747-400 , was supposed_to be flown out over the weekend to air china . no date has yet_been set 0 to get_back to the bargaining table . ``_we want to make_sure 0 they know_what they_want before they come_back , '' said doug hammond , the federal_mediator who has_been in contact with both_sides since the strike began . the investment community , for one , has_been anticipating a speedy resolution . though boeing 's stock price was battered along_with the rest of the market friday , it actually has_risen over the last two_weeks on the strength of new orders . `` the market has_taken two views : that the labor_situation will get settled in the short_term and that things look very rosy for boeing in the long_term , '' said howard rubel , an_analyst at cyrus j. lawrence inc . boeing 's shares fell $_4 friday to close_at $ 57.375 in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . but mr._baker said_0 he_thinks 0 the earliest 0 a pact could_be struck would_be the end of this_month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this_week . still , he said_0 , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer . ``_i would n't_expect an immediate resolution to anything . '' last_week , boeing chairman frank shrontz sent striking workers a letter , saying that `` to my knowledge , boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year_contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history . '' but mr._baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10_% wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' he_added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers_' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime . in separate developments : -- talks have broken off between machinists representatives at lockheed_corp. and the calabasas , calif. , aerospace company . the union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . it had planned a strike vote for next sunday , but that has_been pushed back indefinitely . -- united auto_workers local 1069 , which_represents 3,000 workers at boeing 's helicopter unit in delaware county , pa. , said_0 it agreed_to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis , with a 10-day notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining . the accord expired yesterday . -- and boeing on friday said_0 it received an order from martinair holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued_at a total of about $ 326 million . the planes , long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet , will_be delivered with pratt & whitney pw4060 engines . pratt & whitney is a unit of united technologies inc . martinair holland is based in amsterdam . a boeing spokeswoman_said 0 a delivery date for the planes is still being worked_out `` for a variety_of reasons , but not because of the strike .
