debora foster takes off her necklace , settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward . with a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background , the soothing hands of sabina vidunas begin to work on ms. foster 's neck and shoulders . `` it 's like an oasis in this room , '' ms. foster purrs . the room in question is the directors ' lounge of h.j. heinz co. , 60 floors above the bustle of pittsburgh . there , amid oil paintings and marble tables , massages are administered every wednesday . `` on days that i_'m really busy , ''_says ms. foster , who_works in public_relations for the company , `` it seems decadent to take time off for a massage . '' although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks , on-site massage , as it is known in the trade , is certainly infiltrating corporate_america . in some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office , fearful that upper-level executives wo_n't approve . ms. foster 's indulgence is nothing like the oily , hour-long rubfests enjoyed by spa visitors . nor does it at all resemble -lrb- despite what some executives think -rrb- the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town . on the contrary , office rubdowns usually take_place in dimly lighted conference rooms , where stressed-out employees relax in specially designed chairs , fully clothed . the massages last 15_minutes and typically cost about $ 10 . some companies , including heinz , even pay part_of the fee . ms. vidunas has_been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started at heinz last_year . anthony j.f. o'reilly , the company 's chairman , swears by her firm touch , saying_0 regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries . massage advocates say that kneading the head , shoulders , neck and back can_go a long_way toward easing tension and improving morale . they also insist_that touching is a basic need , as powerful as the need for food or sleep , and that the office is as good a place as any 0 to do it . `` the blood flows to your head , you feel lightheaded and you_do n't feel tension around the head or neck , ''_says minnie morey , an operations supervisor at the social_security office in grand rapids , mich. , where massages began last_month . `` when_you leave the room after your massage , people say_0 you_look like you_'re glowing . '' adds candice ohlman , the 35-year-old masseuse who plies her trade in the grand rapids office , `` they fall in love with my hands . '' not_everyone , however , is at ease with office massage . three_years ago , the internal_revenue service 's office in san_jose , calif. , opened its doors to on-site massage . and even_though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled . `` sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear ` oohs ' and ` ahs ' coming out of the room , '' explains morgan banks , the agency 's health specialist . `` and you_ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing ` oohs ' and ` ahs . ' '' last_month , the complaints intensified and the massages ended . `` now we_'re looking_for a room with thicker walls , '' ms. banks says . massage also has an image problem 0 to contend with . some masseurs have tried_to get around this by calling themselves `` bodyworkers '' and describing their office visits as `` reinvigoration breaks . '' but massage , no_matter how chaste , is still associated in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution , and that makes some executives nervous . last_year , the research and development division of weyerhaeuser co. , the large wood-products concern , invited a masseuse to its tacoma , wash. , offices . phil harms , a software engineer , was an eager customer . `` you build up a_lot of tension working at a terminal all day , '' he_says . but after about eight_months , the vice_president of the division , ed soule , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt . mr. soule says_0 his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room ; the department 's supervised health facility would_have been fine . `` in my view , -lcb- massages -rcb- should_be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around , '' he_says . given such attitudes , some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly . russell borner of park ridge , n.j. , says_0 he has_been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in new_york -- unbeknownst to the company 's executives . he visits the same department every two or three_weeks . his massage chair is kept in a closet , and a secretary escorts him past security . `` this is common with a_lot of large companies , ''_says mr. borner , who_worked for american_telephone &_telegraph co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade . managers , he_contends 0 , `` are afraid how they_'re going_to look in the eyes of their peers . my vision is to change human consciousness towards touch . my attitude is : let 's come_out of the closet . '' occasionally , all that 's needed is a little coaxing . elisa byler , a st._louis masseuse , won over officials at emerson electric_co. , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage . she notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits . ``_i pull my hair back , wear a little makeup and look corporate , ''_says ms. byler , who has_been visiting emerson since_january . `` if i go in there as i normally dress , they_'d ask , ` who is this hippie ? ' '' the self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is david palmer , a 41-year-old san_francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses . to help do this , mr. palmer developed a portable massage chair three_years ago that he hopes 0 will bring `` structured touching '' into mainstream america . `` the culture is not ready to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched for an_hour for $ 45 , '' he_says . `` the idea is to_keep the clothes on and to_keep people seated . the chair is a way_0 to package massage . '' sitting in one of mr. palmer 's chairs , which cost $ 425 and have since been copied by others , is a_bit like straddling a recliner . customers lean forward , rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair . -lrb- ms. ohlman , the grand rapids masseuse , says_0 she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the spanish inquisition . -rrb- mr. palmer , who serves as president of the on-site massage association and writes an industry newsletter , says_0 some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace , as_well as on street corners , in airports and malls , and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can_be found . scot macinnis , a masseur in boulder , colo. , had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as_part of a store promotion . three minutes into the massage , the man curled up , began shaking and turned red . paramedics were called . a week later , the man told mr. macinnis 0 he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage . `` it was a powerful point in my career , ''_says the 31-year-old mr. macinnis , who has since taken out a $_1 million liability policy for his business . `` but he pulled through , and after the ambulance left , there_were still six people in line waiting_for a massage . the next woman was older , and i was afraid to touch her . but it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on . '' despite the number_of fans that office massage has won , some purists look down on it , arguing_that naked , full-body rubs are the only way_0 to go . linda aldridge , who does full-body work in pittsburgh , says that while on-site massage is better_than nothing , tired workers should realize 0 it is only the tip of the iceberg . `` whole areas of their bodies are neglected , '' she_says , adding_that clothes ruin the experience . `` there 's nothing like skin to skin .
