kay peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet_another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats . after a tortuous climb , she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista : a glade of golden aspens under an azure indian-summer sky . this place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker , but reached by ms. peterson and six others in a mere two_hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain_bikes . `` this , ''_says ms. peterson , `` is what it 's all about . '' twelve hundred miles_away , rangers at a napa county , calif. , state park are among the many who do_n't quite share the enthusiasm . this_summer , speeding bikers were blamed for an_accident in the napa county park , in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers -- broke its leg . the animal had to be destroyed ; the bikers fled and were never found . in numerous parks near san_francisco , rangers have_been forced to close trails , set_up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding . they have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained 0 they_were being driven from trails . ``_we were being overrun , ''_says steve fiala , trails coordinator of the east_bay regional park district . two_years ago , the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres . from about 200,000 six_years ago , the number_of mountain_bikes in the u.s. is_expected to grow to 10 million in 1990 . at_least half that growth will have come in the past_three years alone . the controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms 0 to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory . bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient , safe , fitness-promoting way_0 to get_back to nature , while asserting a right , as taxpayers , to pedal on public lands . but the bikes ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the sierras to the eastern seaboard , to ban them from the back country . key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can_go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror . an adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance . such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an_hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians . for harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates . the state of california , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles . the move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles . most other_states have enacted similar bans . the bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks . even the u.s. forest service , whose lenient `` multiple-use '' philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands_of miles of its trails across the u.s. , has_begun to close some lands to the bikes , including major portions of the popular pacific crest trail , which stretches from california to canada . often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations , the politically potent sierra club among them . sierra has_been instrumental in securing a number_of the california bans . it has_been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by utah bike groups , to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas , where they_are now prohibited . yet sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that 17_% of its 500,000 members own mountain_bikes . pressure_from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no_longer , for_example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles . but the club still insists that public lands ought_to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate 0 the bikes wo_n't injure the environment or other users . ``_i have a mountain_bike , yet as a hiker i_'ve been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , ''_says gene coan , an_official at sierra 's headquarters in san_francisco , echoing the concerns of many members . `` people_who feel that cyclists should_be banned from an area are n't looking_at the whole picture , ''_complains mark langton , associate editor of mountain and city biking magazine in canoga park , calif . mr. langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers . he_says 0 fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers ; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy . to fight back , activists such_as mr. langton are forming groups 0 to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs 0 to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails . mr. langton 's group , concerned off-road bicyclists association , mounted petition drives 0 to help keep open certain santa_monica mountain trails designated for closing . biking groups in montana , idaho , michigan and massachusetts have won similar concessions , says_0 tim blumenthal , mountain_bike editor of bicycling magazine . these groups have_been trying_to improve the mountain biker 's image ; in the san francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this_summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol 0 to help rangers enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail etiquette . even staunch anti-bike sierra members concede_that 10_% of all riders cause most of the problems . while some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can_be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , ''_says jim hasenauer , a director of the international mountain biking association . ``_i think_0 we_'re making progress . '' few would_have foreseen such a furor when , a decade_ago , some marin county bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology . they wanted a machine that would_allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles . they got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many_ways easier 0 to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage . when the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 , they_were dismissed as a fad . last_year , 25_% of the 10 million bicycles sold in the u.s. were mountain_bikes . in california , a bellwether market , they accounted_for more_than 80_% of all bike sales . the majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country . city dwellers love them because_they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes . crested butte , population 1,200 , is a bastion of the sport . by one estimate , everyone here under 50 owns at_least one bike . the town is home to the mountain_bike hall of fame and it hosts the annual fat tire bike week . this_summer , the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season . david lindsey , chairman of the fat tire bike celebration , muses that the bike 's popularity may_be a combination of technology and nostalgia . `` the mountain_bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy ' bike 0 you had as a kid , but it can_do so_much more , '' he_says .
