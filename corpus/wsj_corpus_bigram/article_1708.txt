foothills pipe lines ltd. filed an application with canadian regulators to build a 4.4 billion canadian dollar -lrb-_us$ 3.74 billion -rrb- pipeline to transport natural_gas from canada 's arctic to u.s. markets beginning in the application by foothills , owned_by calgary-based nova corp. of alberta and westcoast energy inc. of vancouver , canada , is_expected to kick off what could_be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in canada 's mackenzie river delta . `` this is a pre-emptive strike by foothills , '' said rick hillary , natural_gas manager of the calgary-based independent petroleum association of canada , an industry group . `` foothills wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it 's on first insofar as transporting gas from the arctic to southern markets , '' mr. hillary said . at_least two rival applications are_expected to emerge in coming_months , including one from transcanada pipelines ltd. , canada 's_largest natural_gas pipeline operator . another is_expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this_month from canada 's national energy board to export about 9.2 trillion_cubic feet of mackenzie_delta gas to the u.s. starting in 1996 . the producers include shell canada ltd. , a unit of royal dutch\/shell group ; esso resources canada ltd. , a unit of imperial oil ltd. , which is 71%-owned by exxon_corp. ; and gulf_canada resources_ltd. , a unit of olympia_& york_developments ltd . `` the -lcb- national energy board -rcb- approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage , the rush to build facilities 0 to transport the gas , '' said bill koerner , an_analyst with brady & berliner , a washington , d.c. , law_firm . foothills ' main rival 0 to build a mackenzie_delta pipeline is_likely to be transcanada pipelines . the toronto-based company , together with tenneco inc. of houston , has had an incomplete proposal filed with canadian regulators since_1984 that it is now updating . like foothills , transcanada 's polar gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the mackenzie river delta in canada 's western arctic with an_initial capacity to transport 1.2_billion cubic_feet of gas daily . industry sources_said 0 they_expect a fierce battle to emerge between transcanada , which has a monopoly on canadian gas transportation east of alberta , and nova and westcoast , which control the pipelines within and running west of alberta , respectively . `` this is virgin territory , unclaimed , and it 's going_to be nasty , '' said one observer , who asked_not to be named . `` neither is going_to back down easily . '' transcanada declined to comment_on the foothills application . but last_week gerald maier , president and chief_executive officer of transcanada , said_0 the company `` intends_to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there '' and that it would consider joint_ventures with other players to ensure 0 it has a role . a number_of issues still need to be_resolved before canadian regulators give any project the final go-ahead . first , the price of natural_gas will have to almost double . kent jesperson , president of foothills , said_0 the company believes_0 the project would_be viable if gas prices reach us$ 3.25 a thousand cubic_feet by 1995 , in current dollars , up from a current spot price of about us$ 1.50 . mr. jesperson 's us$ 3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $ 3.39 floor price that calgary-based consulting_firm paul ziff &_co. recently said_0 would_be needed for mackenzie_delta gas producers to see a return on their investment . u.s. gas buyers must also decide_whether they_want to enter firm contracts for mackenzie_delta gas or develop alaskan reserves in the prudhoe bay_area first , a project that has_been on hold for more_than a decade . robert pierce , chairman and chief_executive of foothills , said_0 it 's too_early to say whether alaskan or mackenzie_delta gas would flow to market first . but foothills said_0 it plans to seek regulatory_approval to build an_alternative line , the alaska natural_gas transportation system further north toward alaska . if that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , foothills said_0 it would build another smaller pipeline connecting mackenzie_delta reserves to the alaska mainline . it 's also likely that regulators will try_to forge some_kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects . douglas stoneman , vice_president of shell canada , noted_that producers would_prefer to_avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development . interprovincial pipe line co. , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its_own , said_0 that is n't in the cards . instead , richard haskayne , president and chief_executive of interprovincial 's calgary-based parent , interhome energy inc. , said_0 the company would_prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal . as for foothills ' pre-emptive bid , mr. haskayne said , `` if_they think_0 it gives_them some_kind of priority position , well , that 's their strategy .
