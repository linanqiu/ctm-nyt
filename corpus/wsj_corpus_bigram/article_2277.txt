law_firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines . the disarray in the junk-bond_market that began last_month with a credit crunch at campeau_corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged_buy-out of united_airlines parent_ual corp. has reverberated through some of the nation_'s largest law_firms . while it is still too_early to tell whether the dearth of takeover_activity is only temporary , many lawyers say_0 their firms are_bracing for lower revenue from merger work , which has_been so lucrative in the past . much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour . if deals take longer to complete and there_are fewer of them 0 to do , `` you_ca n't bill the same kind_of premium as when deals took a few_weeks from start to finish , ''_says 0 one lawyer at a large new_york firm . ``_we 're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989 , but next_year we_'ll be another story , '' said robert freedman , a partner at simpson thacher & bartlett . ``_we 're settling down to a less active period . '' lawyers at such firms as sullivan & cromwell ; willkie farr & gallagher ; wachtell , lipton , rosen & katz ; and fried , frank , harris , shriver & jacobson all say_0 they , too , have experienced a significant slowdown , particularly during the past_few weeks . `` everyone is waiting to see if deals can_be done at sensible prices and if money is available , '' said jack nusbaum , co-chairman of willkie farr . `` it 's hard to know right_now if the change is fundamental or cyclical . '' some lawyers say_0 the slump , while more obvious in recent_weeks , began earlier_this year . dennis block , a partner at the new_york firm of weil , gotshal & manges , said that in the first_eight months of this_year , 89 hostile offers were launched , compared_with 157 for the first_eight months of what 's more , he said_0 , `` transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack_of financing '' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts . lawyers also say_0 an erratic stock_market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number_of lucrative big deals likely_to be proposed . still , some lawyers say_0 the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as_much as domestic ones . ``_we just took another floor for our london offices , '' said joseph flom of the new_york firm of skadden , arps , slate , meagher & flom . davis polk & wardwell also said_0 its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy . `` european companies are_looking to buy american ones , '' said henry king , the managing_partner at that firm . `` but the question is whether things 0 people are_looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market_conditions .
