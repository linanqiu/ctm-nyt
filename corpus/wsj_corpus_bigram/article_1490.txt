mips computer_systems inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete_with more_expensive machines from companies such_as sun_microsystems inc. and digital_equipment corp . the closely_held sunnyvale , calif. , company also will_announce an_agreement to supply computers to control_data corp. , which will sell mips machines under its_own label . the new mips machine , called the rc6280 , will cost $_150,000 for a basic system . the computer processes 55_million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors . the machine employs reduced instruction-set computing , or risc , technology . at that price , an_analyst familiar_with the machine said_0 , the computer offers up to 10_times the performance of similar machines . `` in the price range it 's a tremendously high-performing product , '' said sandy gant , an_analyst at the market-research firm infocorp . the machine is part_of an_effort by mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of integrated-circuit technology . mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional risc applications such_as engineering ; mips said_0 the new machine will also be_used by businesses and for communications . `` this clearly demonstrates that mips is a systems company rather_than just a chip company , '' said mips vice_president john hime . the control_data deal is a boon for mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such_as sun , hewlett-packard_co. , motorola inc. and intel_corp. for the emerging market for risc machines . risc technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software . for mips , which expects revenue of $_100 million this_year , big-name allies such_as control_data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's risc architecture . `` the thing 0 it says about mips is that they_'re on a roll right_now , '' said ms. gant at infocorp . `` they_'re getting some major wins , '' she_added . last_month , for_example , mips agreed_to supply its computers to nixdorf computer ag of west_germany and france_'s groupe bull . sony_corp. , tandem_computers inc. and digital_equipment have agreed_to sell mips computers and companies such_as japan 's nec_corp. and west_germany 's siemens a.g. have agreed_to make mips chips under license . today 's agreement gives control_data a machine 0 to compete against digital and other general-purpose computer_makers , said_0 john logan , a computer-market analyst_at aberdeen group_inc. of boston . the machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said_0 . `` suddenly cdc -lrb- control_data -rrb- has a competitive product 0 to fight back against the vax9000 , '' a machine 0 digital announced last_month , he_added 0 . control_data , based in minneapolis , minn. , expects its sales of mips systems , including the new rc6280 , to amount to more_than $_100 million by the end of 1991 , mips said_0 . nixdorf , bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said_0 mips president robert miller . mips will start_shipping its new machine in the first_quarter of 1990 , he said . the machine uses a single processor , which_makes it easier 0 to program than competing machines using several processors . the computer can process 13.3 million calculations called floating-point operations every second . the machine can run software written for other mips computers , the company said_0 .
