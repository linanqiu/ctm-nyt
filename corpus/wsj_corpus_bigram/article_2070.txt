iverson technology corp. was one of the fastest-growing small_companies in america -- until last_year . the mclean , va. , company modifies computers to_keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands . from 1984 to 1987 , its earnings soared six-fold , to $_3.8 million , on a seven-fold increase in revenue , to $ 44.1 million . but in 1988 , it ran_into a buzz saw : a defense_department spending freeze . iverson 's earnings plunged 70_% to $_1.2 million . the troubles continued in this_year 's first_half , when profit plunged 81 % to $ 302,000 . iverson technology is one of many_small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending . unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base 0 to weather the downturn easily , these companies are suffering big drops in business as once-lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear . companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive . as their varied strategies suggest , there_is more_than one way_0 to respond to a disaster -- though it 's too_soon to tell whether the changes will pay_off . for many companies , the instinctive first response is to cut_costs . others are trying_to find specialty defense work spared by the slowdown or new niches created_by budget-cutting . more venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields . erc international_inc. , which_provides professional and technical services to the military , is refining its defense niche , not retreating from it . after quadrupling annual earnings over four_years to $ 6.8_million in 1988 , the fairfax , va. , company , posted a 23_% drop in earnings for this_year 's first_half . in the belief_that development of advanced military technology will_remain a top defense_department priority , erc last_year acquired w.j. schafer associates , a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the strategic_defense initiative . while the sdi anti-missile program recently awarded w.j. schafer two contracts totaling_$ 13.4 million , erc 's chairman and founder , jack aalseth , says_0 he bought the company `` more for its technology than its customer . '' unc inc. , an annapolis , md. , contractor that earned_$ 23.8 million on revenue of $ 400.4 million in 1988 , has gone even further in realigning its military business . as orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled , three_years of steady growth ended with a 69 % drop in income in this_year 's first_half . the company hit on a new strategy : if the defense_department is so intent on saving money , why_not make money off that trend ? among the company 's current efforts : repairing old parts at 25_% of the cost of replacing them . unc also is selling new parts , if needed , directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor . at as little as one-third of the government 's cost , the company is running a program 0 to train army helicopter pilots . it is also taking_over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with 40_% fewer people than the military used . in another approach , tiny iverson technology is trying_to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products . donald iverson , chairman , says_0 he hopes 0 the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets . for now , he_says 0 , ``_we 're_looking at buying some small_companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business . '' earlier_this month , mr. iverson agreed_to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed_by visher systems_inc. , salt lake city . the product automates an_array of functions performed at small to medium-size printing companies . mr. iverson says_0 there_are 5,000 potential customers for the software in the washington , d.c. , area alone . questech inc. , falls church , va. , also has acquired some companies outside the military market . moreover , it 's trying_to transfer its skill at designing military equipment to commercial ventures . a partnership with a williamsburg , va. , unit of shell_oil co. recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that wo_n't melt in microwave ovens . ``_we 're trying_to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come_up with new processes for industry , ''_says vincent salvatori , questech 's chief_executive . `` it is an_effort to branch out from the government , which is very_difficult for a defense_contractor . '' mr. salvatori should know . instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown , dynamic engineering inc. , a troubled subsidiary that makes wind tunnels for the space industry , contributed_to much of questech 's $ 3.3_million loss on $ 55.6 million in revenue last_year . in january , mr. salvatori sold the unit . `` it was our first acquisition , '' he_says , `` and it was a mistake . '' some companies are cutting_costs and hoping for the best . telos corp. , a santa_monica , calif. , provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military , enjoyed steady growth until this_year . following a tripling of earnings , to $_3.9 million , on a doubling of revenue , to $ 116 million , over four_years , earnings in the company 's fiscal_first quarter , which ended_june 30 , plunged 90_% to $ 45,000 . a one-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame , but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the army and delays in getting paid . telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and `` bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities , ''_says lin conger , telos chairman and controlling shareholder . `` it 's evident 0 we_'re entering a more competitive era , '' he_says . transtechnology corp. , a sherman oaks , calif. , defense_contractor that earned_$ 9.2 million on revenue of $ 235.2 million in 1988 , provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting . the company not_only merged three military-electronics manufacturing_operations , but also closed an unrelated plant that makes ordnance devices used in fighter planes and missiles . the closing contributed_to a $_3.4 million loss in the fiscal_first quarter_ended july_31 -- its first quarterly_loss since 1974 . `` our ordnance business has_been hurt very badly by the slowdown , ''_says arch scurlock , transtechnology 's chairman . ``_i would n't say_0 we_'re out of the business . but we_'re not making as many -lcb- pyrotechnic devices -rcb- as we used to .
