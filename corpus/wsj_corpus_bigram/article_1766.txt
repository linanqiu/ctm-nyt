while wall_street is retreating from computer-driven_program trading , big_institutional investors are_likely to continue these strategies at full blast , further roiling the stock_market , trading executives_say 0 . bowing to a mounting public outcry , three more major securities_firms -- bear , stearns_& co. inc. , morgan_stanley &_co. and oppenheimer_& co. -- announced friday 0 they would suspend stock-index_arbitrage trading for their_own accounts . painewebber_group inc. announced a pullback on thursday from stock-index_arbitrage , a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings . though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock_market volatility , most wall_street firms remain open to handle program_trading for customers . trading executives privately say that huge stock-index_funds , which dwarf wall_street firms in terms of the size of their program_trades , will_continue to launch big programs through the stock_market . wells_fargo investment_advisers , bankers_trust co. and mellon capital_management are among the top stock-index_arbitrage clients of wall_street , trading executives_say . these huge stock-index_funds build portfolios that match the s&p_500 stock index or other stock indexes , and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits . `` they will do it every chance 0 they get , '' said one program-trading executive . consequently , abrupt swings in the stock_market are not likely_to disappear anytime_soon , they say_0 . in fact , without wall_street firms trading for their_own accounts , the stock-index_arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may_be all the more abundant . `` more customers may come to us now , '' said james cayne , president of bear_stearns cos . executives who manage these funds see the current debate_over program_trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987_crash . they noted_that studies completed after the 1987_crash exonerated program_trading as a source of volatility . `` the issues that are -lrb- now -rrb- being raised , in classic anti-intellectual fashion , fly in the face of a number_of post-crash studies , '' said fred grauer , chairman of wells_fargo investment_advisers . a bankers_trust spokesman_said that the company 's investment arm uses stock-index_arbitrage to enhance investors_' returns . officials at mellon capital were_unavailable for comment . stock-index_funds have_grown in popularity over the past_decade as pension_funds and other institutional_investors have sought a low-cost way_0 to match the performance of the stock_market as a whole . many money_managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the s&p-500 's returns . some stock-index_funds are huge . wells_fargo investment_advisers , for_example , managed $ 25 billion in stock investments tracking the s&p_500 at the end of june , according_to standard_& poor_'s corp . mr. grauer said_0 $_2 billion of that is used in active index_arbitrage . stock-index_funds frequently use the futures_markets as a hedging tool , but that is a far_less aggressive strategy than stock-index_arbitrage , in which traders buy and sell big_blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index_futures to profit from price differences . the 190-point_plunge in the stock_market oct._13 has heightened concerns_about volatility . and while signs of an economic_slowdown , softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed_to the stock_market 's recent weakness , many investors rushed to blame program_trading for aggravating market swings . the wall_street firms ' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional_investors . last tuesday , kemper corp. 's kemper_financial services_inc. unit said_0 it would no_longer trade with firms committed to stock-index_arbitrage , including the three that later suspended stock-index_arbitrage trading on friday . phoenix mutual life_insurance co. and founders asset_management inc. also cut_off brokerage_firms that engage_in program_trading . though it is still doing stock-index_arbitrage trades for customers , morgan_stanley 's trading_halt for its_own account is_likely to shake up firms such_as kidder , peabody_& co. that still do such trades for their_own account . morgan_stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index_arbitrage traders in recent_months . indeed , morgan_stanley 's president , richard b. fisher , said_0 the firm is putting up money 0 to form a group of regulators , investors and investment banks to find_out if stock-index_arbitrage artificially induces stock-market_volatility . ``_we have to clear up these issues and find_out what is present that is creating artificial volatility , '' mr. fisher said_0 . `` there_is no question that investor_confidence -lrb- in the stock_market -rrb- is critical . '' joining the call for some_kind of study or regulatory action , merrill_lynch &_co. recommended program-trading reforms late_friday , including higher margins on stock-index_futures and greater regulatory coordination . separately , mr. cayne of bear_stearns said_0 his firm is working with regulators to balance margin_requirements to `` enhance stabilization . '' margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash 0 an_investor must put_up when buying a security . current_rules permit investors to put_up less cash for futures than for stocks . some observers_say that different rules governing stock and futures_markets are partly responsible_for volatility . these rules , they say_0 , permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks , which frequently knocks the two markets out of line . stock-index_arbitrage , because it sells the more `` expensive '' market and buys the `` cheaper '' one , attempts_to reestablish the link_between the stock and futures_markets , and the adjustments are often abrupt . but unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks , which invites frequent bouts of stock-index_arbitrage in the first place . `` there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis , '' said christopher pedersen , director of trading at twenty-first securities_corp . `` one agency should have the authority over all equity products .
