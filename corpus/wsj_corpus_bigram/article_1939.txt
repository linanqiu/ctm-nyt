wham ! bam ! twice in two_weeks the unraveling of the on-again , off-again ual_buy-out slammed the stock_market . now , stock_prices seem to be in a general retreat . since peaking at 2791.41 on_oct. 9 , the dow_jones industrial_average has lost 194.69 points , or 7_% , closing friday at 2596.72 , down 17.01 . the number_of issues falling on the new_york stock_exchange each day is eclipsing the number_of gainers . and the number_of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new_highs . but why_should an iffy $_6.79 billion leveraged_buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock_market ? opinions vary about how important the ual_deal was to the market 's health , but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the ual plan crumbled revealed a fundamental_change in investor psychology . `` if this had happened a few_months ago when the atmosphere was still very_positive it would n't have_been greeted with anything like the impact 0 it has had over the past_two weeks , ''_says dennis jarrett , a market_strategist at kidder_peabody . there_are , of course , analysts who view the near-panic that briefly swept through investors on_oct. 13 and again on_oct. 24 as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock_market . sure , price action is volatile and that 's scary , but all-in-all stocks are still a good place 0 to be , they suggest 0 . the reaction to the ual debacle `` is mindless , ''_says 0 john connolly , chief market_strategist at dean_witter . `` ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned . the only way_0 you_can make it a big deal is to draw linkages that just do_n't make_sense . '' he suggests , for_example , that investors may_have assumed that just because ual could_n't get financing , no leveraged_buy-outs can_get financing . carried even further , some investors assumed that since leveraged_buy-outs are the only_thing propping up stock_prices , the market would collapse if no more lbos could_be done . `` there will still be deals , '' argues mr. connolly . `` there may_not be as many and the buyers may_not get away with some of the things 0 they_'ve done in the past , but deals wo_n't disappear . '' he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls `` strategic deals , in which somebody is taking_over a company not to milk the cash_flow , but because it 's a good fit . '' and even without deals , mr. connolly figures 0 the market would remain healthy . he notes , for_instance , that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the 30 stocks in the dow_jones industrial_average since_1986 , yet that average only three_weeks ago hit a record high . `` those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up , '' he_says . even the volatility created_by stock index_arbitrage and other computer-driven trading_strategies is n't entirely bad , in mr. connolly 's view . for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully , the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes . `` who can make the better decision , the guy_who has 10 seconds 0 to decide_what to do or the guy with all the time in the world ? '' he_says . `` what on earth does the ual_deal have to do with the price of walmart , which i was able_to buy on_oct. 16 at a very attractive price ? '' kidder_peabody 's mr. jarrett also sees some benefits to the stock_market 's recent drop . ``_we 've run_into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy , '' he_says . `` the balloon had_been blown up so big that when somebody came along_with a pin -- in this case the ual_deal -- we got a little pop . '' the pop sobered up investors who had_been getting a little too ebullient , says_0 mr. jarrett . `` it provided an_excuse 0 for people to get_back to reality and to look_at the economic_data , especially the third-quarter economic numbers , and to realize that we ca_n't continue to gloss over what is going on in the junk_bond market . '' but he figures that at current_levels the stock_market is comfortably valued , even with the economy obviously slowing . `` just because we_'ve got some realism back in the market does_n't mean_0 it 's going lower from here , '' he_says . `` the bottom_line is that it 's healthy to have this_kind of sideways activity , especially after a 30_% gain in stock values over the past 12_months . '' he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation , the dow_jones industrial_average will once_again forge new_highs . maybe , maybe not . abby joseph cohen , a market_strategist at drexel_burnham lambert , is n't nearly so sanguine about the market 's chances of surging to new_highs anytime_soon . her view is that stock_prices have three major props : merger and buy-out proposals , earnings and the economic_outlook . at current_levels of economic_activity and earnings , stocks are fairly valued , she_says 0 . but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation_that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business , and ual has obviously put a damper on that . `` stocks are n't cheap anymore , there have_been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals , '' she_says . ``_i 'm_not saying_0 they_'ve stopped altogether , but future deals are going_to be structured differently and bids probably_wo n't be as high . '' but that 's not the only problem for stocks . the other two props -- earnings and the economic_outlook -- are troubling , too . `` m&a is getting all the headlines right_now , but these other_things have_been building up more gradually , '' she_says . third-quarter_earnings have_been generally disappointing and with economic_data showing a clear slowing , the outlook for earnings in the fourth_quarter and all of 1990 is getting worse . `` there_are a_lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks_like people are questioning corporate_profits as a means of support for stock_prices , '' she_says . with all this , can stock_prices hold their_own ? `` the question is unanswerable at this point , '' she_says . `` it depends_on what_happens . if the economy slips into a recession , then this is n't a level that 's going_to hold . '' friday_'s market_activity stock_prices tumbled for a third_consecutive day as earnings disappointments , a sluggish economy and a fragile junk_bond market continued to weigh on investors . the dow_jones industrial_average fell 17.01 points to 2596.72 in active_trading . volume on the new_york stock_exchange totaled 170,330,000 shares . declining_issues on the big_board were far ahead of gainers , 1,108 to 416 . for the week the dow_jones industrial_average sank 92.42 points , or 3.4 % . oil stocks escaped the brunt of friday_'s selling and several were able_to post gains , including chevron , which rose_5\/8 to 66 3\/8 in big_board composite_trading of 2.4_million shares . the stock 's advance reflected ongoing speculation_that pennzoil is accumulating a stake_in the company , according_to dow_jones professional_investor report . both_companies declined to comment_on the rumors , but several industry analysts told the professional_investor report 0 they believed 0 it was plausible that pennzoil may_be buying chevron shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company . usx gained 1\/2 to 33 3\/8 on a report in business week magazine that investor carl_icahn is said to have raised his stake_in the oil and steel company to just about 15_% . earlier_this month , mr._icahn boosted his usx stake to 13.4 % . elsewhere in the oil sector , exxon rallied 7\/8 to 45 3\/4 ; amoco rose 1\/8 to 47 ; texaco was_unchanged at 51 3\/4 , and atlantic_richfield fell_1 5\/8 to 99 1\/2 . mobil , which said_0 it plans to cut its exploration and production work_force by about 8_% in a restructuring , dropped 5\/8 to 56 1\/8 . the precious_metals sector outgained other dow_jones industry groups by a wide margin for the second_consecutive session . hecla mining rose_5\/8 to 14 ; battle mountain gold climbed 3\/4 to 16 3\/4 ; homestake mining rose_1 1\/8 to 16 7\/8 ; lac minerals added 5\/8 to 11 ; placer dome went_up 7\/8 to 16 3\/4 , and asa ltd. jumped_3 5\/8 to 49 5\/8 . gold mining stocks traded on the american_stock exchange also showed strength . echo bay mines rose_5\/8 to 15 7\/8 ; pegasus gold advanced_1 1\/2 to 12 , and corona class a gained 1\/2 to 7 1\/2 . unisys dropped 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 after posting a third-quarter_loss of $_4.25 a_share , including restructuring charges , but other important technology issues were_mixed . compaq_computer , which had lost 8_5\/8 thursday following a disappointing quarterly report , gained 5\/8 to 100 5\/8 . international_business machines dropped 7\/8 to 99 7\/8 . digital_equipment tacked on 1_1\/8 to 89 1\/8 , and hewlett-packard fell 3\/8 to 49 3\/8 . dividend-related trading swelled volume in merrill_lynch , which closed_unchanged at 28 3\/8 as 2.7_million shares changed_hands . the stock has a 3.5_% dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today . erbamont advanced_1 1\/8 to 36 1\/2 on 1.9_million shares . montedison , which_owns about 72 % of the company 's common_stock , agreed_to buy the rest for $ 37 a_share . himont , another majority-owned unit of montedison , added_1 1\/4 to 47 1\/8 . milton_roy jumped_2 to 18 3\/8 . crane said_0 it holds an 8.9_% stake_in the company and may_seek control . crane dropped_1 1\/8 to 21 1\/8 . comprehensive_care , which terminated its agreement to merge with first_hospital , dropped 7\/8 to 3_7\/8 . the company 's decision was made after first_hospital failed to_obtain financing for its offer .
