congress learned during the reagan_administration that it could intimidate the executive_branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` provided , that no funds shall_be spent ... . '' this phrase once_again is found throughout the many appropriations_bills now moving through congress . it signals congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article_ii of the constitution . this species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional . the appropriations clause states that `` no money shall_be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law ... . '' the prevailing interpretation of the clause on_capitol hill is that it gives congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability_to withhold funding . this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in 1987 in the iran-contra report . as partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers . it is not supported_by the text or history of the constitution . the framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of 1787 , according_to madison 's notes . to the extent 0 they_did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources 0 to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation . it would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -lrb- technically a limitation on legislative power -rrb- could_be read as placing the president on congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress . as it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations_bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal_1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . during the coming_weeks , president_bush must decide_whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of article_ii , and thus void and severable . the 1990 appropriations legislation attempts_to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article_ii . article_ii places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the advice and consent of the senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the u.s. . it also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without senate approval : `` the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . '' yet section 605 of the appropriations_bill for the executive office provides : `` no part_of any appropriation for the current_fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall_be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has_been nominated after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations_bill , congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under article_ii . section 605 also imposes unconstitutional_conditions on the president 's ability_to nominate candidates of his choosing . the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding 0 to pay that person 's salary . the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing_to serve without pay , because the anti-deficiency act prohibits voluntary service to the government . the 1990 appropriations_bills also contain a number_of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article_ii of the constitution . muzzling provisions , which might_be called `` blindfold laws '' as_well , prevent the executive_branch from even looking_at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to congress . such laws violate the provision in article_ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress , but which gives the president the discretion 0 to select the subject matter of those recommendations . typically , these laws seek to prevent executive_branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations_bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . there_is something inherently suspect about congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are_being wasted in some favored program or other . perhaps none of the unconstitutional_conditions contained in the appropriations_bills for fiscal_1990 better illustrates congress 's attempt_to usurp executive power than section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` none of the funds made_available pursuant to the provisions of this act shall_be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has_been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the united_states . '' this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could_be said to be `` duly adopted '' even_though it would_require neither bicameral action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . the supreme_court 's decision in ins v. chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional . president_bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds_of unconstitutional_conditions on the president 's ability_to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . if president_bush fails to do_so in his first year , he will invite congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite article_ii of the constitution to suit its purposes . what becomes custom in the bush_administration will only become more_difficult 0 for future presidents , including democrats , to undo . president_reagan learned that lesson . by 1987 , then-speaker jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail_gorbachev and then attempting_to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii . if a veto is unworkable because it would_leave part_of the executive_branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations_bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his article_ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable . the constitution does_not expressly give the president such power . however , the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution . the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto . excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under article_ii would_be different from the line-item_veto . as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item_veto is characterized as a way_0 for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending_bill that are objectionable merely because_they conflict with his policy objectives . the excision of unconstitutional_conditions in an appropriations_bill would_be a power of far_more limited applicability . one could argue_that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional_conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers . there_is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional_conditions in the fiscal_1990 appropriations_bills . if congress does nothing , president_bush will have won . if congress takes the dispute to the supreme_court -lrb- assuming 0 it can establish standing 0 to sue -rrb- , president_bush might win . in that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives 0 the framers thought_0 should_be entrusted to the executive . if president_bush loses at the court , it might_be disappointing , as morrison v. olson was for the reagan_administration . but the presidency would_be no worse off than it is now . moreover , the electorate would_have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice . as it stands now , congress presumes after the reagan_administration that the white_house will_take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations_bills lying down . president_bush should set things straight . if he does_not , he will_help realize madison 's fear in the federalist no. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . '' mr. sidak served_as an_attorney in the reagan_administration . his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later_this year .
