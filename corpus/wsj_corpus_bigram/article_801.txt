the space_shuttle atlantis boosted the galileo spacecraft on its way to jupiter , giving a big lift as_well to an ambitious u.s. program of space exploration . seven_years late in the launching , $_1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors , galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the national_aeronautics and space_administration . but yesterday , as atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above florida with storm clouds closing in on it , nasa sought to turn galileo into a symbol of triumph . `` nasa did it right ; that 's the message , '' said j.r. thompson , the agency 's deputy administrator . the $_1.4 billion robot spacecraft faces a six-year journey to explore jupiter and its 16 known moons . if all goes well , it will parachute a probe into the dense jovian atmosphere in july 1995 to pick_up detailed data about gases that may_be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed 4.6 billion years_ago . jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of earth -- that its gravity may_have trapped these primordial gases and never let_them escape . investigating jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer tobias owen calls the `` cosmic paradox '' of life : jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such_as hydrogen that are essential for life on earth , but these planets are lifeless ; earth , on the other_hand , has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life . some scientists have suggested_that comets and asteroids may_have brought enough of this_kind of material from the outer solar system to earth to spawn life . beginning in december 1995 , galileo will_begin a two-year tour of the jovian moons . in 1979 , two voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of jovian moons io and europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system . the photos showed active geysers on io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated_that europa may_have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice . galileo 's photos of europa will_be more_than 1,000 times as sharp as voyager 's , according_to torrence johnson , galileo 's project scientist , and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on earth . atlantis lifted galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m._edt and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later . `` galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world , '' atlantis commander donald williams said . `` fly safely . '' the five-member atlantis crew will conduct several experiments , including growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space , before their scheduled landing at edwards air_force base , calif. , monday . the galileo project started in 1977 , and a number_of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch . an ebullient mr._johnson , wearing a nasa baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars , called the launch `` fantastic . '' benny chin , manager of the galileo probe , compared it to watching a child leave home . ``_i 'm happy and sad , '' he said . anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view . having argued_that galileo 's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday , they_were n't quieted by yesterday 's successful launch . galileo will skim past earth in 1990 and 1992 , collecting energy from the planet 's gravitational field to gain momentum for its trip to jupiter . the protesters point_out that galileo also could crash to earth then . they said_0 they dropped plans to infiltrate the kennedy space center after nasa beefed up its security . one protest did get past nasa 's guard , though ; a computer virus caused anti-galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at nasa centers . the successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the u.s. space-science program . an unmanned spacecraft , magellan , already is heading to venus and is due to begin mapping the planet next august . voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of neptune and its moon , triton , this_summer . next_month , nasa plans to launch a satellite 0 to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe . in december , the shuttle columbia will try_to retrieve a satellite that 's been in orbit for nearly five_years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments . next_march , the shuttle discovery will launch the hubble space telescope , a $_1.5 billion instrument designed to see the faintest galaxies in the universe . not all of nasa 's space-science work will_be so auspicious , though . around thanksgiving , the solar max satellite , which nasa repaired in orbit in 1984 , will tumble back_into the earth 's atmosphere . nasa wo_n't attempt a rescue ; instead , it will try_to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where .
