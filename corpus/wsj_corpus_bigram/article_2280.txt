program_traders are fond of predicting that if_they are blocked in the u.s. , they will simply emigrate to foreign stock_markets . but in london and tokyo , where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role , traders_say 0 a number_of hurdles loom . government_officials , especially in japan , probably would resist any onslaught of program_trading by players trying_to shrug off the u.s. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business . japan is `` very concerned '' about the possible effects of program_trading , a senior japanese official said_0 after the oct._13 stock plunge in new_york . u.s. stock-index_futures are n't even traded in japan now . and because of the time difference , the japanese and the u.s. markets ' trading hours do_n't overlap . it all adds up to a barrier to american-style index_arbitrage , the most_popular form of u.s. program_trading that seeks to exploit brief differences_between prices of stocks in new_york and the price of a futures_contract in chicago based_on those stocks . about 11.6 % of all program_trading by new_york stock_exchange firms in_september took_place in foreign markets , according_to big_board data . yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce chicago-style stock-index_futures . japan 's finance_ministry already is scrutinizing institutional_investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope_with the current_level of program_trading , said_0 makato utsumi , vice minister for international finance . program_trading has_taken off in japan since last_year 's introduction of home-market stock-index_futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock_exchanges . but regulators are wary . they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last dec. 7 , when the first bout of foreign-led index_arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading , startling regulators who thought_0 they had written enough rules 0 to prevent such a swing . japan 's finance_ministry had set_up mechanisms 0 to limit how far futures_prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time . `` maybe it was n't enough , '' a finance_ministry official noted after the dec. 7 surge . japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases . tokyo 's leading program_traders are the big u.s. securities houses , though the japanese are playing catch-up . some u.s. firms , notably salomon inc. and morgan_stanley group_inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index_arbitrage , both for customers and for their_own accounts . -lrb- morgan_stanley last_week joined a growing list of u.s. securities_firms that have stopped doing index_arbitrage for their_own accounts . -rrb- both deryck c. maughan , who_heads salomon in tokyo , and john s. wadsworth , who_heads morgan_stanley there , ascribe a good part_of their firms ' success in tokyo to their ability_to offer sophisticated , futures-related investment strategies to big_institutional clients . they do_n't have plans to cut_back . `` it has not been disruptive in the markets here , '' mr. maughan said . `` the real difference seems to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact 0 it_does in america . '' the british also are scrutinizing program_trades . index-arbitrage trading is `` something 0 we_want to watch closely , '' an_official at london 's stock_exchange said_0 . ``_we do_n't think_0 there_is cause for concern at the moment . '' london serves increasingly as a conduit for program_trading of u.s. stocks . market professionals said_0 london has several attractions . first , the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes . second , it can_be used to unwind positions before u.s. trading begins , but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big_board close . in_addition to the extra privacy of these trades , the transactions can often be less_expensive to execute , because the parties do_n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee . still , `` much_less -lcb- index-arbitrage activity -rcb- is done over here than in the u.s. '' said_0 richard barfield , chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. , which manages about # 15 billion -lrb- $ 23.72 billion -rrb- in united_kingdom institutional funds . britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments . a financial_times-stock exchange_100-share index option contract is traded on the london stock_exchange 's traded options market . and an ft-se futures_contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange . both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market_crash . the average number_of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984 . this_year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year_earlier and from 917 in 1984 . but a survey early this_summer indicated_that the volume of index-options trading was only 15_% of the size of the underlying equity market , exchange officials said_0 . this compares_with estimates that the u.s. `` derivatives '' market is perhaps four_times as large as the underlying domestic market .
