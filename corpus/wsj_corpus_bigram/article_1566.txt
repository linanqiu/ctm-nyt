philip_morris cos. is launching a massive corporate advertising_campaign that will put the tobacco giant 's name in tv commercials for the first_time since the early 1950s , when it stopped advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television . the campaign , a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the bill of rights , does_n't mention cigarettes or smoking ; cigarette ads have_been prohibited on television since 1971 . but even_before it begins , the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates , who criticize philip_morris 's attempt_to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of american democracy . philip_morris , which became the u.s. 's_largest food company last_year with its $ 12.9 billion acquisition of kraft inc. , seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in marlboro country . the company 's research suggests_that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low , although its array_of brands --_including maxwell house coffee , jell-o , cheez whiz , and miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves . the company is_expected to spend about $ 30 million a year on its two-year corporate campaign , created_by wpp_group 's ogilvy_& mather unit in new_york . the initial spots will appear during morning and prime-time news shows . philip_morris hopes that by taking its bill of rights theme to the airwaves , in_addition to publications , it will reach the broadest possible audience . until_now , its corporate ads , mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts , have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines . `` most people -- whether in toledo , tucson or topeka -- have n't got a clue who we are , ''_says guy l. smith , philip_morris 's vice_president of corporate affairs . `` if_they think well of the company through our support of the bill of rights , it follows 0 they_'ll think well of our products . '' mr._smith says_0 the bill of rights commercial , which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression , is n't designed to have any special appeal for smokers . although philip_morris typically tries_to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments , `` this has nothing 0 to do with cigarettes , nor will it ever , '' the spokesman says_0 . but some anti-smoking activists disagree , expressing anger at what they see as the company 's attempt_to purchase innocence by association . ``_i 'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of american culture and political freedom and in fact it 's a killer , ''_says michael pertschuk , former_chairman of the federal trade_commission and a tobacco-industry critic . `` it should_be treated like the medellin -lcb- drug -rcb- mafia , not the founding fathers . '' mr. pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of philip_morris 's political strategy . these_include trying_to protect its print advertising by invoking the first_amendment , and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil_rights . -lrb- the commercial features , among_others , the voice of martin luther king jr. , the slain civil_rights leader . -rrb- many marketers say_0 philip_morris 's approach will_be effective , but they agree that the ads ' implied smoking message is unmistakable . `` this is clever , subliminal advertising that really says , ` smokers have rights , too , ' ''_says al ries , chairman of trout & ries inc. , a greenwich , conn. , marketing strategy firm . `` this is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise . '' richard winger , a partner at boston consulting group , adds_: `` it 's very popular to drape yourself in the flag these_days . if_you can_do that and at the same_time send a message that supports your business , that 's brilliant . '' rjr_nabisco inc. and american_brands inc. say_0 they have no plans to follow philip_morris 's lead . -lrb- indeed , rjr_nabisco is currently under fire for having sent 80-second videotapes touting its now brand to consumers who smoke american_brands ' carltons . -rrb- despite the criticism , philip_morris 's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube . `` they_are n't showing james madison taking a puff or lighting up , ''_says laurence tribe , a professor of constitutional law at_harvard university . `` all 0 they_are trying_to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the bill of rights itself .
