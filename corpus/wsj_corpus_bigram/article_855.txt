two_years of coddling , down the drain . that 's the way_0 a_lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market_crash . ever_since that fearful black_monday , they_'ve been tirelessly wooing wary individual_investors -- trying_to convince them that oct._19 , 1987 , was a fluke and that the stock_market really is a safe place 0 for average americans to put their hard-earned dollars . and until last_friday , it seemed 0 those efforts were starting to pay_off . `` some of those folks were coming_back , ''_says leslie quick jr. , chairman , of discount brokers quick & reilly group inc . ``_we had heard from people_who had n't been active '' for a long time . then came the frightening 190-point_plunge in the dow_jones industrial_average and a new wave of stock-market_volatility . all of a sudden , it was back to square one . `` it 's going_to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , ''_says jeffrey b. lane , president of shearson_lehman hutton_inc . ``_i think_0 it will shake confidence one more time , and a_lot of this business is based_on client confidence . '' brokers around the country say_0 the reaction from individual_investors this_week has_been almost eerie . customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining_about the stock_market in the exact way_0 they_did in post-crash 1987 . `` the kinds_of questions 0 you had before have resurfaced , ''_says raymond a. `` chip '' mason , chairman of regional brokerage_firm legg_mason inc. , baltimore . ``_i can just tell 0 the questions are right back where they_were : ` what 's going on ? , ' ` ca_n't anything be_done about program_trading ? , ' ` does_n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` where is the sec on this ? ' '' mr._mason says_0 he 's convinced 0 the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even_though they believe_0 the deck is stacked against them . but `` these wide swings scare them to death . '' all of this is bad_news for the big brokerage_firms such_as shearson and merrill_lynch &_co. that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , businesses . after expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987_crash , retail brokerage operations these_days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead . true , the amount of money 0 investors are willing_to entrust to their brokers has_been growing lately . but those dollars have_been going into such `` safe '' products as money market funds , which do_n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage_firms . at discount brokerage charles_schwab &_co. , such `` cash-equivalent '' investments recently accounted_for a record $ 8 billion of the firm 's $ 25 billion of client 's assets . the brokers ' hope has_been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock_market . and before last_friday , they_were actually making modest progress . a slightly_higher percentage of new_york stock_exchange volume has_been attributed to retail investors in recent_months compared_with post-crash 1988 , according_to securities industry_association data . in 1987 , an_average 19.7 % of big_board volume_was retail business , with the monthly level never more_than 21.4 % . the retail participation dropped to an_average 18.2 % in 1988 , and shriveled to barely 14_% some months during the year . yet in 1989 , retail participation has_been more_than 20_% in every month , and was 23.5 % in_august , the latest month for which figures_are available . jeffrey schaefer , the sia 's research_director , says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could_be overstated by as_much as five percentage_points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in big_board data . but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup . but `` friday did_n't help things , ''_says 0 mr. schaefer . with the gyrations of recent_days , says_0 hugo quackenbush , senior_vice president at charles_schwab , many_small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock_market . '' joseph grano , president of retail_sales and marketing at painewebber_group inc. , still thinks that individual_investors will eventually go_back into the stock_market . investors will develop `` thicker skins , '' and their confidence will return , he_says 0 . friday_'s plunge , he is telling painewebber brokers 0 , was nothing more_than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged_buy-out stocks . '' meanwhile , painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to_keep giving wall_street their money . `` it 's more of an_important issue to_keep control of those assets , rather_than push the investor to move into -lrb- specific -rrb- products such_as equities , '' mr. grano says . `` the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a semblance of confidence . '' it could_be a long wait , say_0 some industry_observers . `` some investors will tiptoe back in , ''_says richard ross , a market research_director for elrick & lavidge in chicago . `` then there 'll_be another swing . given enough of these , this will drive everyone out except the most hardy , '' he_adds . mr._ross , who has_been studying retail investors_' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said_0 a market_plunge like friday_'s `` shatters investors_' confidence in their ability_to make any judgments on the market . '' the long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' mr._ross declares 0 .
