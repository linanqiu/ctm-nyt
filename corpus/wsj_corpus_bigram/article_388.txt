conner peripherals inc. , which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers , is on target to surpass compaq_computer corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in u.s. business_history . conner dominates the market for hard-disk_drives used to store data in laptop computers . it said yesterday that net_income for its third_quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8_million , or 28 cents_a share , from $ 6.8_million , or 19_cents a_share , in the year-ago_period . its revenue totaled_$ 184.4 million , an_increase of 172 % from $ 67.8 million a year_ago . for the nine_months , the san_jose , calif.-based company said_0 net_income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69_cents a_share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents_a share . revenue nearly tripled to $ 479 million , from $ 160_million . analysts_expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $_40 million , or $_1 to $_1.05 a_share , on sales of $_650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business . that 's a faster growth_rate than reported by compaq , which did_n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 . but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster_than any previous manufacturing start-up . conner 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand_for battery-operated computers , the computer_industry 's fastest-growing segment . since its inception , conner has both benefited_from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10_times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines . today , conner controls an_estimated 90_% of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers . the company supplies drives to compaq and zenith data_systems , the top two u.s. manufacturers of laptops , and to toshiba_corp. , nec_corp. and sharp corp. , the leading japanese laptop makers . `` they_'ve had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they_'ve been greatly rewarded , '' said bob katsive , an_analyst at disk\/trend inc. , a market researcher in los altos , calif . in the coming_months , however , this is_likely to change . next_month , seagate_technology , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk_drives for personal_computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers . and the japanese are_likely to_keep close on conner 's heels . `` they_are going_to catch_up , '' said david claridge , an_analyst with hambrecht_& quist . both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk_drives , and sony also is studying the field , mr. claridge said_0 . but conner is n't standing still . yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed_at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . `` most of our competitors are announcing products based_on our -lrb- older -rrb- products , '' said_0 finis conner , chief_executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his_name . ``_we continue to develop products faster_than anyone_else can . '' these new products could account for as_much as 35_% of the company 's business in 1990 , mr. conner estimated 0 . ``_we 're_not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , '' he said . conner already is shipping its new drives . last_week , for_instance , compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews . conner is supplying hard-disk_drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase . from its inception , conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk_drives that are smaller and use far_less power than those offered by competitors such_as seagate . the availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand_for laptop computers , whose usefulness had_been limited because of lack_of storage . conner also makes hard-disk_drives for desktop_computers and is a major supplier to compaq , which as of july owned 40_% of conner 's stock . sales to compaq represented 26_% of conner 's business in its third_quarter , compared_with 42_% in the year-ago_period .
