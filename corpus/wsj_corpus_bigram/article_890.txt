the survival of spinoff cray_computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily_on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , seymour cray . not_only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray , so is its balance_sheet . documents_filed with the securities and exchange_commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray_research inc. will withdraw the almost $_100 million in financing 0 it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the product-design project 0 he heads is scrapped . the documents also said that although the 64-year-old mr. cray has_been working on the project for more_than six_years , the cray-3 machine is at_least another year away_from a fully_operational prototype . moreover , there have_been no orders for the cray-3 so_far , though the company says_0 it is talking with several prospects . while many of the risks were anticipated when minneapolis-based cray_research first announced the spinoff in may , the strings 0 it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday . ``_we did_n't have much of a choice , '' cray_computer 's chief_financial officer , gregory barnum , said in an_interview . `` the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 , and without him it could not be_completed . cray_research did_not want to fund a project that did_not include seymour . '' the documents also said that cray_computer anticipates needing perhaps another $ 120_million in financing beginning next september . but mr. barnum called that `` a worst-case '' scenario . the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray_research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close_at $ 38 in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . analysts noted yesterday that cray_research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company . `` it has to be considered as an_additional risk for the investor , '' said gary p. smaby of smaby group_inc. , minneapolis . `` cray_computer will_be a concept stock , '' he said . `` you either believe_0 seymour can_do it again or you_do n't . '' besides the designer 's age , other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology . the sec documents describe those chips , which are made of gallium arsenide , as being so fragile and minute 0 they will_require special robotic handling equipment . in_addition , the cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice_as many as the largest current supercomputer . cray_computer also will face intense_competition , not_only from cray_research , which has about 60_% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is_expected to roll out the c-90 machine , a direct competitor with the cray-3 , in 1991 . the spinoff also will compete_with international_business machines_corp. and japan 's big three -- hitachi ltd. , nec_corp. and fujitsu ltd . the new company said_0 it believes_0 there_are fewer_than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- presumably the cray-3 price range . under_terms of the spinoff , cray_research stockholders are to receive one cray_computer share for every two cray_research shares 0 they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two_weeks . no price for the new shares has_been set . instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide . cray_computer has applied to trade on nasdaq . analysts calculate cray_computer 's initial book_value at about $_4.75 a_share . along_with the note , cray_research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the cray-3 development , which has_been a drain on cray_research 's earnings . pro-forma balance_sheets clearly show why cray_research favored the spinoff . without the cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would_have been_able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first_half of 1989 rather_than the $_5.9 million 0 it posted . on the other_hand , had it existed then , cray_computer would_have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss . mr. cray , who could_n't be_reached for comment , will work for the new colorado_springs , colo. , company as an_independent contractor -- the arrangement 0 he had with cray_research . regarded_as the father of the supercomputer , mr. cray was paid $ 600,000 at cray_research last_year . at cray_computer , he will_be paid $ 240,000 . besides messrs. cray and barnum , other senior management at the company includes neil davenport , 47 , president and chief_executive officer ; joseph m. blanchard , 37 , vice_president , engineering ; malcolm a. hammerton , 40 , vice_president , software ; and douglas r. wheeland , 45 , vice_president , hardware . all came from cray_research . cray_computer , which currently employs 241 people , said_0 it_expects a work_force of 450 by the end of 1990 .
