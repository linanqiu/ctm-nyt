if japanese_companies are so efficient , why does kawasaki-rikuso transportation co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to osaka ? why , until last_spring , did the long-term credit bank of japan sometimes take several days to correct typographical errors in its paper_work for international transactions ? because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the u.s. and western_europe , japanese corporations ' reputation_as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right . their factories may look_like sets for a spielberg movie , but their offices , with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses , are more like scenes from a dickens novel . now , the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching japan . kawasaki-rikuso , a freight company , set_up its_own software subsidiary this_year and is spending nearly a year 's profit to more_than double the computer terminals at its main office . in april , the long-term credit bank linked its computers in tokyo with its three american offices . overall , pc sales in japan in the first_half of 1989 were 34_% higher_than in the year-earlier_period . combined pc and work-station use in japan will jump as_much as 25_% annually over the next five_years , according_to some_analysts , compared_with about 10_% in the u.s. . and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more japanese_companies are concluding that they have no choice . ``_we have too_many people in our home offices , ''_says yoshio hatakeyama , the president of the japan management association . `` productivity in japanese offices is relatively low . '' with japanese_companies in a wide_range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities_firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more_efficient japanese economic army may rattle foreigners . but it also offers opportunities ; americans are well poised to supply the weapons . japan may_be a tough market 0 for outsiders to penetrate , and the u.s. is hopelessly behind japan in certain technologies . but for now , at_least , americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them . after years of talking_about selling in japan , more and more u.s. companies are seriously pouring in . apple_computer inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year . lotus_development corp. has slashed the lag between u.s. and japan product introductions to six_months from three_years . ungermann-bass inc. has a bigger share of the computer-network market in japan than at home . but the japanese have to go a long_way to catch_up . typical is one office of the ministry of international_trade and industry 's machinery and information industries bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer_industry . `` personal_computer '' yearbooks are lined_up on nearly every desk , and dog-eared copies of nikkei computer crowd magazine racks . but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life pc . while american pc sales have averaged roughly 25_% annual growth since_1984 and west european sales a whopping 40_% , japanese sales were_flat for most of that time . japanese office workers use pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one-third that of the americans . moreover , japanese offices tend_to use computers less efficiently than american offices do . in the u.s. , pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network . in japan , many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca_n't communicate with other machines . the market planning and sales promotion office of nomura_securities co. , for_example , has more_than 30 computers for its 60 workers , a respectable ratio . but the machines are n't on employees_' desks ; they ring the perimeter of the large office . some machines make charts for presentations . others analyze the data . to transfer information from one to the other , employees make printouts and enter the data manually . to transmit charts to branch offices , they use a fax machine . meanwhile , a woman sitting next to a new fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator . in an efficient setup , the same pc could perform all those tasks . in the u.s. , more_than half the pc software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis , according_to lotus . in japan , those functions account for only about a third of the software market . machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the u.s. , are still more common in japan than pcs . in the u.s. , one-fifth of the office pcs are hooked up to some_sort of network . in japan , about 1 % are linked . `` computers here are used for data gathering , ''_says roger j. boisvert , who_manages the integrated-technologies group in mckinsey &_co. 's tokyo office . some japanese operations , such_as securities-trading rooms , may_be ahead of their american counterparts , he_says 0 , but `` basically , there 's little analysis done on computers in japan . '' of course , simply buying computers does_n't always solve problems , and many american companies have erred by purchasing technology 0 they_did n't understand . but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag . various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand . because the japanese `` alphabet '' is so huge , japan has no history of typewriter use , and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older workers , remains a common affliction . ``_i have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery , ''_says matsuo toshimitsu , a 66-year-old executive_vice president of japan air_lines , explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this_summer . while most american employees have their_own private space , japanese `` salarymen '' usually share large , common tables and rely heavily_on old-fashioned personal contact . top japanese executives often make decisions based_on consensus and personal relationships rather_than complex financial projections and fancy presentations . and japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single , integrated computer_system corporatewide . besides , a computer processing the japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols . until_recently , much of the necessary technology has_been unavailable or at_least unaffordable . some_analysts estimate 0 the average pc costs about 50_% more in japan than the u.s. . but the complex language is n't the only reason . for the past_decade , nec_corp. has owned more_than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with near-monopoly power . with little competition , the computer_industry here is inefficient . the u.s. market , too , is dominated_by a giant , international_business machines corp . but early on , ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it . dozens_of small_companies did , swiftly establishing a standard operating_system . that spurs competition and growth , allows users to change and mix brands easily , and increases software firms ' incentive to write packages because_they can_be sold to users of virtually any computer . if a record industry lacked a common standard , sony cd owners could listen to a sony version of madonna 's `` like a prayer '' but not one made for a panasonic player . that is the state of japan 's computer_industry . nec wo_n't release its code , and every one of the dozen or so makers has its_own proprietary operating_system -- all incompatible with each_other . ibm established its standard to try_to stop falling behind upstart apple_computer , but nec was ahead from the start and did_n't need to invite in competitive allies . meanwhile , the big players have n't tried_to copy the nec standard . corporate pride as_well as the close ties common among japanese_manufacturers help explain_why . most rivals `` have a working relationship_with nec , often through cross-licensing of technology , '' the japan personal_computer software association noted 0 recently . `` they hesitate to market nec-compatible machines ; nec disapproves of such machines , and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship . '' the result , according_to many analysts , is higher_prices and less innovation . while tens of thousands_of software packages using the ibm standard are available in the u.s. , they say_0 only about 8,000 are written for nec . a year_ago , japan 's fair trade_commission warned nec about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting . in japan , `` software is four to five_years behind the u.s. because hardware is four to five_years behind , because nec is enjoying a monopoly , ''_complains 0 kazuhiko nishi , the president of ascii corp. , one of japan 's leading pc-magazine publishing and software companies . `` there_are no price_wars , no competition . '' an nec spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in japan because customers put a greater emphasis_on quality and service than they do in the u.s. . she adds that some technological advances trail those in the u.s. because the japanese still import basic operating_systems from american companies . but the market is changing . the government is funding several projects to push pc use . over the next three_years , public schools will get 1.5_million pcs , a 15-fold increase from current_levels . in the private_sector , practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees_' exposure to computers . toyota_motor corp. 's sales offices in japan have one-tenth the computers per employee that its_own u.s. offices do ; over the next five_years , it is aiming for rough parity . within a year , kao corp. , a major cosmetics company , plans to eliminate 1,000 clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work , such_as credit reports , currently performed in 22 separate offices . by increasing the number_of pcs 0 it uses from 66 to 1,000 , omron tateishi electronics co. , of kyoto , hopes not_only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way_0 the company is run . `` managers have long been those_who supervise their subordinates so orders would_be properly acted on , '' a spokesman says . `` but new managers will have to be creators and innovators ... and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can_be reached easily , and also shared . '' meanwhile , more computer_makers now are competing for the new business . seiko epson corp. , a newcomer to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling nec clones last_year . it has won about 15_% of the retail pc market . sony_corp. , which temporarily dropped out of the pc business three_years ago , started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading japanese company in that market . in a country where elbow room is scarce , laptop machines will_take a large portion_of the industry 's future growth . toshiba_corp. busted open that sector this_summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less_than 200,000 yen_-lrb- under $ 1,500 -rrb- -- one of the smallest , cheapest pcs available in the country . fujitsu_ltd. is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history --_including a 100,000-guest bash at tokyo dome -- for its sophisticated sound\/graphics fm towns machine , which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke , bar singing . many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying_to band together to create some_sort of standard . two_years ago , most of the smaller makers joined under the microsoft corp. umbrella to adopt a version of the american ibm at standard . that has n't generated much sales , but this_summer microsoft rallied all the major nec competitors to make their new machines compatible_with the ibm os\/2 standard . a healthy , coherent japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese_companies to sell overseas , where their share is still minimal . but it could also help american companies , which also are starting to try_to open the market . as with many other goods , the american share of japan 's pc market is far_below that in the rest of the world . u.s. makers have under 10_% share , compared_with half the market in europe and 80_% at home . though no formal trade_barriers exist , the japanese computer_industry is difficult 0 for outsiders to enter . `` if it were an open_market , we would_have been in in_1983 or 1984 , ''_says eckhard pfeiffer , who_heads compaq_computer corp. 's european and international operations . his company , without_any major effort , sells more machines in china than in japan . although it has opened a new_zealand subsidiary , it is still only `` studying '' japan , the only nation that has n't adopted ibm-oriented specifications . and because general retail centers such_as computerland have little presence in japan , sales remain in the iron grip of established computer_makers . but the americans are also to blame . they long made little effort here . ibm , though long a leader in the japanese mainframe business , did_n't introduce its first pc in japan until five_years after nec did , and that was n't compatible even with the u.s. ibm standard . apple did_n't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the chinese characters of written japanese -- until three_years after entering the market . critics also say_0 american companies charge too_much . japan 's ftc says_0 it is investigating apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting . but the u.s. companies are redoubling their efforts . apple recently hired its first japanese president , luring away an_official of toshiba 's european operations , as_well as a whole japanese top-management team . earlier_this year , it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating_system and a kanji laser printer . ibm just last_year started selling its first machine that could run in both japanese and english and that substantially enhances compatibility with its american products . `` it may take five_years to break even in japan , ''_says john a. siniscal , who_runs the asia-pacific office for mccormack & dodge , a u.s. software company . `` but it 's an enormous business opportunity .
