when thomas w. wathen went big league last_year , he acquired a treasure-trove of americana along_with a well-known but ailing security business : pinkerton_'s inc . there was a wanted poster offering `` rewards for the arrest of express and train robbers frank james and jesse w. james '' and the original pinkerton_'s logo with an open eye and the inscription ``_we never sleep , '' which inspired the phrase `` private eye . '' then there_were two gold watches once owned_by allan pinkerton , who founded the company in chicago in 1850 . but there_were supposed_to be three , mr._wathen 's company claims 0 . the missing watch is emblematic of the problems 0 mr._wathen encountered in building his closely_held california plant_protection security service into the largest detective and security agency in the u.s. through acquisitions . the ever-optimistic mr._wathen has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can_be a shortcut to growth , it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems . ``_we cleared out a_lot of rats ' nests , ''_says the 60-year-old security veteran . mr._wathen , who started his career as an air_force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies , built his california plant_protection from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the san fernando valley . he joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next_year . over the next 20_years , california plant_protection opened 125 offices around the country . yet although california plant_protection was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 summer olympics in los_angeles -- it still did_n't have the name recognition of pinkerton_'s . so when american_brands inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as_part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations , mr._wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives . he decided 0 he could_easily merge pinkerton_'s operations with his_own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities . he could acquire a staff of loyal pinkerton_'s employees , many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm , he could eliminate a competitor and he could_get the name recognition 0 he 'd wanted . mr._wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate 0 an entrepreneur like himself , who 'd spent his whole career in the security business , could run pinkerton_'s better_than an unfocused conglomerate or investment_banker . `` the security business is my favorite subject . i love this business , '' he_says . `` most of the lbo guys do_n't know_how to run a business anyway . '' but there_were hitches , not the least of which was that , mr._wathen says , he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $ 95 million acquisition , which was completed in january 1988 . ``_we were n't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons . if we had , it might_have scared us off , '' he_says . five_years of rapid expansion under american_brands , with an emphasis_on marketing the agency 's services instead of improving them , had hurt pinkerton_'s profits , mr._wathen claims 0 . he_says 0 his team could_n't tell whether accounts receivable had_been paid or not . pinkerton_'s had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business , with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired , he_adds 0 . and regional offices were `` egregiously overstaffed , '' he claims 0 . one office had 19 people doing the work of three , `` and half of the employees had company automobiles . '' american_brands declined to comment_on mr._wathen 's accusations . the acquisition combined the country 's_second-largest security company , pinkerton_'s , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , california plant_protection , with $_250 million in sales , creating the industry 's_biggest firm , which took on the pinkerton_'s name . even after divesting itself of $ 120_million of unprofitable business , the new pinkerton_'s will have sales of about $ 610 million this_year and operating_profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3 % of sales , says_0 lloyd greif of sutro &_co. in los_angeles , which arranged the pinkerton_'s acquisition . mr._wathen says_0 his turnaround strategy has_been simple : just hack away at the fat . he began by closing 120 of the combined companies_' 260 offices in two_months , eliminating about 31 % of the company 's 2,500-person adminstrative staff , including more_than 100 sales positions . he shut_down the company 's tony new_york headquarters . pinkerton_'s world headquarters today is a nondescript , two-story office building across the street from the small van_nuys airport . next , mr._wathen raised pinkerton_'s rates , which were 75-cents-an-hour lower_than california plant_protection 's average_rate of around $ 8.63 . and he got rid of low-margin businesses that just were n't making money for the company . mr._wathen , who says_0 pinkerton_'s had a loss of nearly $ 8 million in 1987 under american_brands , boasts that he 's made pinkerton_'s profitable again . but mr._wathen 's team still must_pay down about $ 82 million of long-term bank_debt from the acquisition within the next four_years . last_year , earnings of the combined companies did_n't cover debt service and pinkerton_'s was forced to borrow $ 20 million of subordinated_debt . ``_we would n't have had to refinance if a_lot of the problems had n't been there , '' mr._wathen says . this_year , mr._wathen says_0 the firm will_be able_to service debt and still turn a modest profit . now pinkerton_'s could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent . the company recently_filed suit in state_court in los_angeles against american_brands , seeking at_least $_40 million in damages from the old greenwich , conn.-based company . the suit alleges_that american_brands misrepresented the financial_condition of pinkerton_'s before the sale , failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which pinkerton_'s was in default , had n't registered the pinkerton_'s name and trademark in the united_kingdom and did_n't tell california plant_protection about some labor controversies . ``_we have previously had discussions_with representatives of pinkerton_'s inc. concerning the -lcb- sale of the company -rcb- and we concluded_that we did_not have liability under the contract , ''_says american_brands . `` as this is now a litigation matter , we have no further comment . '' and then there 's the case of the missing gold watch . the lawsuit alleges_that an inventory of pinkerton_'s memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches had n't been forked over by american_brands . `` american brand 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new pinkerton_'s in an amount as yet 0 -lcb- to be -rcb- determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained , '' the suit charges . the key to pinkerton_'s future will_be sticking to what it_does best -- being a security company , says_0 mr._wathen . the company is also renewing its emphasis_on investigations , particularly undercover investigations for corporations . although investigations now account for only about 5_% of pinkerton_'s total revenue , that side of the business has traditionally been the more `` glamorous '' of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value . -lrb- author dashiell hammett , who wrote `` the maltese falcon , '' was a former pinkerton_'s detective . -rrb- american_brands `` just had a different approach , '' mr._wathen says_0 . `` their approach did_n't work ; mine is .
