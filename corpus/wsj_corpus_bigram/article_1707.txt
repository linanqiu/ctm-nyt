boeing_co. 's third-quarter_profit leaped 68_% , but wall_street 's attention was focused_on the picket line , not the bottom_line . in fact , the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world 's no._1 jet maker and the striking machinists_union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two_weeks . doug hammond , the federal_mediator in seattle , where boeing is based , said_0 the parties will_continue to sit_down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again . despite the progress , boeing indicated_that the work stoppage , now in its 27th day , will have `` a serious adverse impact '' on the current quarter . for the third_quarter , net_rose to $ 242 million , or $_1.05 a_share , from $ 144 million , or 63 cents_a share . sales climbed 71 % to $ 6.36 billion from $ 3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand_for commercial airliners . because it 's impossible to gauge how_long the walkout by 55,000 machinists rank and file will last , the precise impact_on boeing 's sales , earnings , cash_flow and short-term investment position could_n't be_determined . the investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will_be settled before there_is any lasting effect_on either boeing or its work_force . the company 's total firm backlog of unfilled_orders at sept._30 stood_at a mighty $ 69.1 billion , compared_with $ 53.6 billion at the end of although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $_5 billion if it is n't able_to deliver any more planes this_year , those dollars actually would just be deferred until 1990 . and the company is certain to get_out some aircraft with just supervisors and other non-striking employees on hand . before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of oct. 4 , boeing had_been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period . that included 21 of the company 's 747-400 jumbo jets , its most_successful product . `` it 's not a pretty picture , '' said david smith , an_analyst with raymond james &_associates . `` but it would just mean a great first and second_quarter next_year . '' phillip brannon of merrill_lynch capital_markets added : `` you_do n't_want to minimize this and say_0 nobody is looking_at it . but the strike has n't gone on long enough for boeing to lose business in any real sense . '' that 's the primary reason 0 the company 's share price has held up so well when , in mr._smith 's words , `` most companies would_have unraveled '' by now . in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading , boeing closed_yesterday at $ 54.50 a_share , off a scant 12.5_cents . still , boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside . in a statement , chairman frank shrontz asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts . for_instance , he_noted that spending on pentagon programs is shrinking , and boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects , including the b-2 stealth bomber , the v-22 osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the air_force 's next-generation tactical fighter . because of cost_overruns on fixed-price military work , mr. shrontz said_0 , the company 's defense business will record `` a significant loss '' in 1989 . moreover , mr. shrontz added , production-rate increases that have_been implemented on the 737 , 747 , 757 and 767 programs have resulted in `` serious work_force skill-dilution problems . '' suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules . and , of course , there 's the unsteady labor_situation . besides the machinists pact , accords representing 30,000 of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the puget sound and wichita , kan. , areas expire in early december . also , a contract with the united auto_workers at the company 's helicopter plant in philadelphia expired oct._15 . this contract , covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers , is being extended on a day-to-day basis . the machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10_% base wage increase over the life of the three-year_contract , plus bonuses of 8_% the first year and 3_% the second . on top of that , boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5_% for each year of the contract . the union , though , has called the offer `` insulting . '' the company reiterated yesterday that it 's willing_to reconfigure the package , but not add to the substance of it . for the nine_months , boeing 's net increased 36_% to $ 598 million , or $ 2.60 a_share , from $ 440 million , or $ 1.92 a_share . sales soared 28_% to $ 15.43 billion from $ 12.09 billion . in a separate matter , the justice_department yesterday said_0 boeing agreed_to pay the government $ 11 million to_settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the air_force while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the kc-135 tanker aircraft . the settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from 1982 to 1985 , prosecutors said_0 . they added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 1\/2-year investigation into the company 's aluminum pricing practices in_connection with kc-135s . a boeing spokesman responded : `` all along the company has said_0 there was no grounds for criminal prosecution . that was borne out by the justice_department 's decision '' to_settle the case .
