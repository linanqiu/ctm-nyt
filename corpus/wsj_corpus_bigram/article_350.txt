ford_motor co. and saab-scania ab of sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded_that the cost to modernize saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return . with the collapse of the talks friday , european analysts_expect ford to intensify its pursuit of british luxury_car maker jaguar_plc , which is scrambling to fend_off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance_with ford 's archrival , general_motors corp . saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search_for an ally 0 to shore_up its sagging car business . saab said last_week 0 it `` has had and will_continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . '' among the possible suitors is italy_'s fiat s.p . a , analysts said last_week . ford and saab officials_declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an_agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . '' individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late_last week that the no._2 u.s._auto maker lost interest as it became_clear that the swedish auto_maker 's automotive_operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology . ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to_expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury_car markets . in_addition , ford and saab had discussed a possible link_between their heavy truck operations . but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did_n't go far . some european analysts speculated_that officials of saab 's highly profitable scania truck operation balked_at surrendering any of their autonomy . meanwhile , ford officials became convinced 0 they could_n't expect to recover the investment 0 it would_require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market . saab 's problems were underscored friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2_billion kronor_-lrb- $ 186.1 million -rrb- loss during the first_eight months of this_year , slightly worse_than saab-scania had forecast in its first-half report last_month . overall , saab-scania 's pretax_profit during the first_eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1_billion swedish kronor_-lrb- $ 155.1 million -rrb- from 1.96 billion_kronor -lrb- $ 303.9 million -rrb- a year_earlier . industry analysts in europe said_0 the most_likely suitor for saab now is fiat . saab and fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of saab 's 9000 model , fiat 's croma and lancia 's thema . last_month , saab-scania chief_executive georg karnsund said_0 his company has had talks_with fiat about a broader alliance . but the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said . as for ford , analysts_expect 0 the end of the saab play will_allow the u.s._auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with gm for a stake_in jaguar . the failure of the saab talks `` makes it even more crucial for -lcb- ford -rcb- to be victorious '' in the jaguar contest , said stephen reitman , european auto_industry analyst_at ubs-phillips &_drew in london . ford faces an uphill fight for jaguar , however . jaguar executives said last_week 0 they_expect to have a friendly alliance_with gm wrapped up by the end of the month . gm , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the british parliament who are touring the auto_maker 's headquarter operations in detroit . a gm spokesman_said 0 the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation . but ford clearly views jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would_give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s. . last_week , ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its german-built scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name . so despite the gm-jaguar romance , analysts_say 0 ford by last_friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about 11_% of the luxury_auto maker 's shares_outstanding from 10.4_% early last_week . about 5.4 million jaguar_shares changed_hands in active_trading on london 's stock_exchange friday , and jaguar_shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence_-lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . on the u.s. over-the-counter_market , jaguar 's american_depositary receipts rose 12.5_cents to $ 11.125 . joann s. lublin contributed_to this_article .
