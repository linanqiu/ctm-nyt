the limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this_week when the supreme_court refused_to hear an_appeal from a case that says_0 corporate defendants must_pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm . we_can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind_of solomonic aid to those_who 've_been hurt . but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum 0 this_country has 0 to debate risk , technology and innovation . too often now , a single court_decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases . from the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -lrb- des -rrb- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness . the drug was approved_by the food and drug_administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels . in the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users . the cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could_n't recall whose brand they used . beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including california and new_york decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would_be assessed against drug_makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales . this has some logic . drug_makers should n't be_able to duck liability because people could_n't identify precisely which identical drug was used . but courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope . just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns_out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may_have offered different warranties . the ultimate result came in hymowitz v. lilly , where the highest new_york court expanded the market-share approach for the first_time to say that drug_makers that could_prove 0 mindy hymowitz 's mother did_n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages . but as duke university law professor william van alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could_be held liable in new_york for a bad apple even_if he sold all his apples in california . despite the supreme_court 's refusal to hear the case , there_are serious constitutional issues of due_process and uncompensated takings from the defendants . the big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will_be limited to des or to drugs . the problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine . the california supreme_court last_year reversed direction to make it much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs . the court rejected strict liability for prescription_drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs . `` public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even_though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said . the california justices noted_that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , bendectin , off the u.s. market . this raises the key issue : what to do about people_who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ? we now know that holding drug_makers liable where there 's no_evidence that they or anyone_else knew of any risks only means 0 the drugs wo_n't be available to anyone . as liability expert peter huber tells us , after the hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time 0 to sell that company 's stock short . '' we also know that the tort system is a lousy way_0 to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much_less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either_way . des daughters and other victims of drugs would_be better_off if their cases were taken out of the courts . congress could create a compensation program 0 to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs . but a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation . everyone by now understands that congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation 0 to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass . we have no_doubt 0 this is one_reason 0 judges in new_york and justices on the supreme_court are willing_to trash the law in the des cases . they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know 0 it wo_n't be_done by congress .
