brooks armored car service_inc. never wanted to get into money laundering . but july 5 , a thunderstorm in wilmington , del. , caused shellpot creek to rise 15 feet , pouring 1.3_million gallons of water into basement vaults . the water destroyed about $_75 million in currency and caked $_4 million of coins with mud , rendering them dangerous to counting machines . the $_75 million in paper money , although moldy , mildewy and smelly , was exchanged through the federal_reserve bank of philadelphia without incident . but brooks was_unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement_with the government . ``_we kind_of got caught between bureaucracies , ''_says president william f. brooks jr . the u.s. mint would n't take the coin because it was n't mutilated , and the federal_reserve bank accepts only clean coins , he_says 0 . the philadelphia fed says_0 it is merely an `` agent '' for coins , responsible only for storage and distribution . ``_we issue paper money ; we destroy paper money , ''_says jane hinkle , a philadelphia fed spokeswoman . `` the coin is their problem . '' a mint official says_0 the agency offered to clean the coins for its `` bare-bones '' cost of $ 17,000 plus certain other expenses . but brooks declined , figuring that transporting the mucked up money to washington would cost the company thousands more . so brooks gave the dirty work to coin wrap inc. , which came up with an_unusual solution . for eight hours a day for the past_two weeks , in aggregates of as_much as 27,000 pounds -lrb- equaling $_20,000 in pennies -rrb- , coin wrap has_been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck . a giant heater , working like a blowtorch , causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers . after clanging around for an_hour or so , the shiny , hot money pours out of the cement chute , where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers . after cooling , the coins are then rewrapped . brooks expects to pay coin wrap a total of about $_20,000 -- a cost that insurance wo_n't cover . and while the job is half done , brooks is still bitter . in fact , there 's only one_person involved who 's happy , and that 's floyd string , president of coin wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution . not_only did his company find $_20,000 worth of work , but when the approach was suggested , mr. string says_0 , brooks officials `` did_n't laugh at me or anything .
