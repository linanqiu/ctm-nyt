for retailers , christmas , not halloween , promises to be this_year 's spookiest season . many retailers fear 0 a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such_as campeau_corp. slash tags to spur sales . concerns_about the stock_market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition_from catalog companies also haunt store operators . `` profits at christmas could_be under_attack for every retailer , '' asserts norman abramson , president and chief_operating officer of clothestime inc. , an off-price chain . even_if there_is n't any widespread discounting , the outlook for industry profits is n't good . management horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this_year , after annual drops that averaged 4.5_% in 1988 and 1987 . `` for the last two and a half years , retailing has_been in a mild recession , ''_says carl steidtmann , chief_economist at the columbus , ohio , consulting_firm . this_year , many stores are entering the christmas_season in turmoil : bonwit_teller and b._altman parent l.j._hooker corp. is operating under_chapter 11 of the federal_bankruptcy code ; b.a.t_industries plc 's healthy saks_fifth avenue and marshall_field 's chains are on the auction block ; campeau 's bloomingdale_'s is also on the block . industry_observers expect a wide divergence in performance . stores in a state of confusion are_likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such_as limited inc. , may department_stores co. and dillard department_stores inc. , which should do well . `` there_are going_to be very_clear winners and very_clear losers , ''_says cynthia turk , a touche ross &_co. retail consultant . says mr. steidtmann : ``_i 'm looking_for a bi-polar christmas . '' economists_expect general_merchandise sales in the fourth_quarter to rise 4.5_% to 6_% from year-ago figures . but mr. steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as_much as 25_% to 30_% . troubled chains could see their sales drop as_much as 8_% , he_believes 0 , as managers distracted by fears_about the future allow their stores to get sloppy . thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales . catalog companies are_likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this_year , particularly in december . more_than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost federal_express service that guarantees pre-christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date . `` traditionally , consumers were concerned_about ordering after the first of december because_they did_n't believe_0 they would get it by christmas , ''_says adam strum , chairman of the wine enthusiast inc. , which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail . using federal_express delivery last_year , mr. strum says_0 , `` december was our biggest month . '' even sears , roebuck_& co. is getting_into the act , offering for the first_time to have federal_express deliver toys ordered by dec. 20 from its wish book catalog . k_mart corp. chairman joseph e. antonini summed up his outlook for the christmas_season as `` not troublesome . '' he 's not predicting a blockbuster , but he is `` more optimistic than three_months ago '' because employment remains strong and inflation low . other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday . philip m. hawley , chairman of carter hawley hale stores_inc. , expects sales at department_stores open at_least a year to rise a modest 3_% to 5_% over last_year 's totals , both for his company and the industry in general . ``_i 'm_not looking_for a runaway christmas at all , '' he_says . `` it is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes , ''_says woolworth corp. chairman harold e. sells , `` but it is n't going_to be a bust either . '' mr. sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides woolworth stores includes kinney and foot locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise `` pretty_much in line '' with its year-to-date increases of between 8_% and 9_% . the estimate includes the results of new stores . a consumer poll_conducted in early september by leo j. shapiro &_associates , a market researcher based in chicago , also suggests a modest holiday . of the 450 survey respondents , 35_% said_0 they_expect to spend less buying christmas gifts this_year than last_year , while 28_% said_0 they_expect to spend_more and 37 % said_0 their gift budget would stay the same . the results are almost identical to shapiro 's september_1988 numbers . retailers could_get a boost this_year from the calendar . christmas falls on a monday , creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores . most will stay open late saturday_night and open their doors again sunday . but many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last_minute . `` what you_'ll hear as we get into december is that sales are sluggish , '' predicts woolworth 's mr. sells . `` the week ending the 24th is going_to save the entire month for everyone .
