west_german insurance giant allianz ag entered the takeover_battle between france_'s cie . financiere_de paribas and cie. de navigation_mixte . allianz said_0 it won french government approval to buy as_much as one-third of navigation_mixte , a diversified financial , transport and food holding_company . the move comes a week after paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7 % control of navigation_mixte . munich-based allianz 's brief explanatory statement said_0 it is acting to_protect its_own interests as a shareholder of navigation_mixte . that would_be a blow to both paribas and navigation_mixte . each had claimed allianz , europe 's_largest insurance company , as a tacit ally . the allianz statement also reinforced the belief_that the takeover_battle could_be a long one . it led to broad market speculation_that paribas now will sweeten its bid , which is_expected to be formally launched later_this week , after approval from french government regulators . allianz 's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of west_german companies , looking_ahead to the reduction in european_community internal barriers in 1992 , to get involved in what until_now were considered internal french affairs . deutsche_bank , dresdner_bank and commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to_expand in france before 1992 . dresdner_bank this_month moved to_acquire banque internationale des placements , a small french merchant_bank that deutsche_bank had looked_at and passed over . commerzbank had_hoped to buy a stake_in credit_lyonnais , until the socialists returned to government last_year and canceled plans to privatize the large french bank . deutsche_bank has actively sought a french acquisition for at_least two_years . lately , analysts_say 0 , deutsche_bank has shocked some in the french financial_community by indicating 0 it wants a strong bank with a large_number of branches . ``_we are still looking , '' said a deutsche_bank spokesman . `` the banks 0 we_think 0 would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale , though deutsche_bank would_be able_to pay a good price . '' while allianz officials were n't willing_to comment in any detail on their plans , they said_0 allianz currently_holds between 5_% and 10_% of navigation_mixte , an_apparent increase from the 5_% stake that navigation_mixte officials had earlier announced . paris market sources_said 0 they believed 0 allianz was buying yesterday_morning , and navigation_mixte moved up 108 francs_-lrb- $ 17.19 -rrb- to close_at 1,908 francs in heavy_trading . it was the first day of trading following the suspension of navigation_mixte shares last monday , when paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each navigation_mixte share . allianz also holds a 50_% stake_in navigation_mixte 's insurance subsidiary , one of france_'s largest insurance groups , which it bought for about 6.5_billion francs just before paribas launched its bid . navigation_mixte holds the remaining 50_% . allianz said in its statement that it was acting to_protect that interest , which ties it to navigation_mixte as a partner . allianz 's statement stressed the company 's previously_announced position that paribas 's offer price is too_low . allianz also suggested , without saying so directly , that it regrets that paribas is n't bidding for all of navigation_mixte 's shares . the problem here , analysts_say 0 , is that if paribas wins its 66.7 % , remaining navigation_mixte shares will fall in value . that displeases many current holders , such_as allianz , which could_n't be_sure of selling all their shares if_they tendered to paribas . the allianz statement led to speculation_that allianz eventually could sell to paribas . that would_be bad_news for navigation_mixte 's current management , which was counting on allianz to help fend_off paribas . allianz did_n't say whom , if anyone , it will support . it said simply that it will boost its navigation_mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to_protect itself , as long as it has french regulatory officials ' approval . paribas currently intends_to offer 1,850 francs a_share for navigation_mixte shares that receive full dividends this_year . it is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on july 1 , which receive partial dividends . alternatively , it would offer to swap three paribas shares for one navigation_mixte share . paribas already holds_about 18.7 % of navigation_mixte , and the acquisition of the additional 48 % would cost it about 11 billion_francs under its current bid . the bid values navigation_mixte at around 23 billion_francs , depending_on how_many holders of navigation_mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires .
