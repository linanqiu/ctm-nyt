september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest_rates caused_by the new price data contributed_to the stock_market 's plunge friday . after falling for three consecutive months , the producer_price index for finished goods shot up 0.9_% last_month , the labor_department reported 0 friday , as energy_prices jumped after tumbling through the summer . although the report , which was released before the stock_market opened , did_n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average , analysts said_0 it did play a role in the market 's decline . analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the federal_reserve was unlikely to allow interest_rates to fall as many investors had_hoped 0 . further fueling the belief_that pressures in the economy were sufficient to_keep the fed from easing credit , the commerce_department reported friday that retail_sales grew 0.5_% in_september , to $ 145.21 billion . that rise came on top of a 0.7_% gain in_august , and suggested 0 there_is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . ``_i think_0 the friday report , combined_with the actions of the fed , weakened the belief_that there was going_to be an_imminent easing of monetary_policy , '' said robert dederick , chief_economist at northern trust_co. in chicago . but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers . `` the overall 0.9_% increase is serious in itself , but what is even_worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer_price index still increased by 0.7_% , '' said gordon richards , an_economist at the national_association of manufacturers . but sung won sohn , chief_economist at norwest corp. in minneapolis , blamed rising energy_prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump . ``_i would say_0 this is not bad_news ; this is a blip , '' he said . `` the core rate is not really out of line . '' all year , energy_prices have skewed the producer_price index , which measures changes in the prices 0 producers receive for goods . inflation unquestionably has_fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil_prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates . energy_prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual_rate since the start of the year , the labor_department said_0 . while far_more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 %_increase for all of 1988 . moreover , this_year 's good inflation news may_have ended last_month , when energy_prices zoomed up 6.5_% after plunging 7.3_% in_august . some_analysts expect oil_prices to remain relatively stable in the months_ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . analysts had expected that the climb in oil_prices last_month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer_price index , but the 0.9_% climb was higher_than most anticipated 0 . ``_i think_0 the resurgence -lcb- in inflation -rcb- is going_to continue for a few_months , '' said john mueller , chief_economist at bell mueller cannon , a washington economic forecasting firm . he predicted 0 that inflation will moderate next_year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . but dirk van dongen , president of the national_association of wholesaler-distributors , said that last_month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9_% figure suggests 0 . `` if_you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather_than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained . passenger car prices jumped 3.8_% in_september , after climbing 0.5_% in_august and declining in the late spring and summer . many analysts said_0 the september increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990_models . although all the price data were adjusted_for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices_rose beyond the customary autumn increase . prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in_september , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . food prices declined 0.6_% , after climbing 0.3_% in_august . meanwhile , the retail_sales report showed that car_sales rose 0.8_% in_september to $ 32.82 billion . but at_least part_of the increase could have come from higher_prices , analysts said_0 . sales at general_merchandise stores rose 1.7_% after declining 0.6_% in_august , while sales of building materials fell 1.8_% after rising 1.7_% . producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4_% in_september , after dropping for three consecutive months . prices for crude goods , an_array of raw_materials , jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in_august and edging up 0.2_% in july . here are the labor_department 's producer_price indexes -lrb- 1982 = 100 -rrb- for september , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from september , 1988 .
