the internal_revenue service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation . in_addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will_take the unusual step of looking to the private_sector to fill two new high-level positions 0 to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller 0 to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer 0 to update the information system , which_includes probably the largest computer data base in the world . the irs also said that it would_create the position of chief_financial officer , who will_be hired from within the agency . irs commissioner fred t. goldberg said_0 the changes are intended_to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more_than $_5 billion and collects about $_1 trillion a year . `` my assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we_do not have the kinds_of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' mr._goldberg said . `` and we_do n't have internal controls and discipline that we_need to have to spend $_5 billion properly . '' mr._goldberg , who_took over as head of the irs in july , has_been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack_of coordination among the branches of the vast federal_agency . the irs operates on a computer_system designed in 1961 , which it has_been trying_to modernize for years . and the agency , which operated throughout fiscal_1989 with a $ 360 million budget shortfall , has_been under a hiring freeze since last fall . the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will_go a long_way toward enhancing its ability_to collect more tax revenue . ``_i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , i_believe 0 will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said . the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon . customarily , it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency , but mr._goldberg said_0 he plans to `` scour the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller . although the jobs will_probably pay between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 a year , irs officials are confident_that they_can attract top-notch candidates from the private_sector . `` you_'re telling someone 0 they_can spend the next three or four or five or six_years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' mr._goldberg said . `` on the comptroller side , you_'re developing and making work financial controls governing a $_6 billion budget .
