put down that phone . walk around the room ; take two deep breaths . resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks . that 's the advice of most investment professionals after friday_'s 190-point_drop in the dow_jones industrial_average . no_one can say for sure what will happen today . and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six_months . but they_'re nearly unanimous on one_point : do_n't sell into a panic . investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it . even after friday_'s plunge , the dow_jones industrial_average was 48 % above where it landed on_oct. 19 two_years ago . panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past . the crash of 1929 was followed_by a substantial recovery before the great_depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . the `` october massacres '' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did_n't lead to severe or sustained downturns . indeed , some pros see friday_'s plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this_week , as a chance for bargain hunting . `` there has_been a_lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying_opportunity if_you 've_got the cash , ''_says stephen b. timbers , chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper_financial services_inc . but most advisers think_0 the immediate course for individual_investors should_be to stand pat . `` when_you see a runaway train , ''_says steve janachowski , partner in the san_francisco investment advisory firm brouwer & janachowski , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' even for people_who expect a bear market in coming_months -- and a sizable number_of money_managers and market pundits do -- the advice is : wait for the market to bounce_back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . the best thing 0 individual_investors can_do is `` just sit tight , ''_says marshall b. front , executive_vice president and head of investment counseling at stein roe & farnham inc. , a chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion . on the one hand , mr. front says_0 , it would_be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . '' on the other_hand , it 's not_necessarily a good time 0 to jump in and buy . `` this is all emotion right_now , and when emotion starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said . `` so it 's more prudent to wait and see_how things stabilize . '' roger ibbotson , professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm ibbotson associates_inc. , says , `` my real advice would_be to just ride through it . generally , it is n't wise to be in and out '' of the stock_market . mr. ibbotson thinks that this_week is `` going_to be a roller-coaster week . '' but he also thinks_0 it is `` a good week 0 to consider buying . '' john snyder , former_president of the los_angeles chapter of the national_association of investors corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual_investors , says_0 his_fellow club members did_n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no_reason 0 to sell now . ``_we 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he_says . ``_we understand panics and euphoria . and we hope to take_advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge . '' one camp of investment pros sees what_happened friday as an_opportunity . over the next days and weeks , they say_0 , investors should look for stocks 0 to buy . friday_'s action `` was an old-fashioned panic , ''_says 0 alfred goldman , director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards &_sons in st._louis . `` stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . '' his advice : `` you ought_to be there with a basket catching them . '' james craig , portfolio_manager for the denver-based janus fund , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during friday_'s plunge . stocks such_as hershey foods_corp. , wal-mart stores_inc. , american international group_inc. and federal_national mortgage_association became such bargains that he could_n't resist them , he_says 0 . and mr. craig expects to pick_up more shares today . `` it will_be chaotic at first , but i would not be buying if i_thought 0 we were headed for real trouble , '' he_says . he argues_that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest_rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 . mr. front of stein roe suggests_that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have_been beaten down a_lot more_than the market in this correction . '' his firm favors selected computer , drug and pollution-control stocks . other investment pros are more pessimistic . they say_0 investors should sell stocks -- but not_necessarily right_away . many of them stress that the selling can_be orderly , gradual , and done when stock_prices are rallying . on thursday , william fleckenstein , a seattle money_manager , used futures_contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . he_thinks 0 the underlying inflation_rate is around 5_% to 6_% , far higher_than most people suppose . in the pension accounts 0 he manages , mr. fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural_gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . he_thinks 0 government_officials are terrified to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high . so he_thinks 0 the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation . as a result , mr. fleckenstein says_0 , ``_i think_0 the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market . david m. jones , vice_president at aubrey g. lanston &_co. , recommends treasury_securities -lrb- of up to five_years ' maturity -rrb- . he_says 0 the oct._6 employment_report , showing slower economic_growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing_sector , is a warning sign to investors . one strategy for investors who_want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual_stocks 0 they own or on a broad market index . a put_option gives its holder the right -lrb- but not the obligation -rrb- to sell a stock -lrb- or stock index -rrb- for a specified_price -lrb- the strike price -rrb- until the option expires . whether this insurance is worthwhile depends_on the cost of an_option . the cost , or premium , tends_to get fat in times of crisis . thus , buying puts after a big market slide can_be an expensive way_0 to hedge against risk . the prices of puts generally did_n't soar friday . for_example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli_lilly &_co. moved up from 3_% at thursday 's close to only 3.3_% at friday_'s close , even_though the shares dropped more_than $ 5.50 . but put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes today . it 's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts . but investors should keep in mind , before paying too_much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9_% to 10_% a year ; a return of 15_% is considered praiseworthy . paying , say , 10_% for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return . james_a. white and tom herman contributed_to this_article .
