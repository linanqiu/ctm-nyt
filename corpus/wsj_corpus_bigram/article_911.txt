could the collapse of i-880 have_been prevented ? that was the question 0 structural engineers and california transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying_to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck nimitz_freeway in oakland that caved in during tuesday 's temblor . after touring the area , california gov. george deukmejian late_yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse , blaming the disaster on substandard construction , the associated press reported 0 . the impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives . but there_are other long-term effects that raise serious questions_about the ability of california 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor . it could_easily be two_years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect oakland with san_francisco is reopened , and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more_than $_250 million , said_0 charles j. o'connell , deputy district director in los_angeles of the california department of transportation , nicknamed caltrans . caltrans in sacramento said_0 total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $_500 million . the aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in los_angeles as_well , as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to los_angeles freeways by 1994 . caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the harbor freeway just south of los_angeles , near the memorial coliseum . los_angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double-decking in the area . caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early_1970s , following the 1971 sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of los_angeles , mr. o'connell explained 0 . that temblor measured 6.1 on the richter_scale ; tuesday 's was so why even consider stacking freeways now ? ``_we 've run out of places 0 to build freeways in l.a. , and the only place 0 to go is up , '' mr. o'connell said , although he acknowledges 0 there_are many obstacles , including cost . but as for safety , he_says 0 double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the richter_scale . reasons for the collapse of the nimitz_freeway were sketchy yesterday . but most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact_that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake . the two-story roadway , designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957 , was supported_by columns that apparently lacked the kind_of steel reinforcement used in highways today . while the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement , they apparently lacked an adequate number_of metal `` ties '' that run horizontally through the column , said_0 leo parker , a structural engineer in los_angeles . caltrans today uses a variation of the design 0 mr. parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside . but in the case of the nimitz_freeway , the lack_of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined_up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below . officials of the state agency did_n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did_n't hold up . caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as_part of a $_55 million statewide project , using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake . caltrans spokesman jim drago in sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work . liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took `` reasonable care '' to build and maintain the structures , says_0 john messina , a tacoma , wash. , personal-injury attorney who_specializes in highway design and maintenance cases . the firm brought in to strengthen the structure could_be liable as_well . the results of the quake certainly raise questions_about whether reasonable care was taken , mr. messina says_0 . given the seismic history of the bay_area , `` it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event . '' caltrans ' mr. drago defended the agency 's work on the nimitz_freeway . `` the work was done properly , '' he said . `` basically , we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something 0 the structure could_n't withstand . '' ironically , caltrans this_year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state , this time wrapping freeway columns in `` steel blankets '' to reinforce them . but only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority , and the nimitz_freeway , supported_by double rows , was left out , mr. drago explained 0 . `` the reason is that the technology is such that we_'re not able_to retrofit multi-column structures , '' he said . charles mccoy in san_francisco and john_r. emshwiller in los_angeles contributed_to this_article .
