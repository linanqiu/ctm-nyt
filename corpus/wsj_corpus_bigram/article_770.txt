sebastian guzman_cabrera took_over the oil workers union , mexico 's most_powerful labor organization , only last january . but even in that short time mr._guzman cabrera has_become as controversial in his_own way as his deposed predecessor , joaquin hernandez galicia , known_as la_quina . president_carlos salinas de gortari used the army to oust la_quina , who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run petroleos mexicanos , or pemex , one of the world 's most inefficient oil_companies . now , mr._guzman cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as_much a company man as la_quina was a crook . in recent contract_negotiations with pemex management , mr._guzman cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in subcontracting , long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings . and with the quiet pragmatism of mr._guzman cabrera replacing the prickly populism of la_quina , government technocrats have_been given a free hand 0 to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign_investment . mr._guzman cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance . brawls between union factions still erupt at pemex installations . leftist leader cuauhtemoc cardenas publicly questioned mr._guzman cabrera 's `` moral quality , '' suggesting 0 he is part_of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil , a symbol of mexican nationalism , to foreigners . the 61-year-old mr._guzman cabrera takes such criticisms in stride . `` this is n't a new kind_of union leadership , it 's a new_mexico . we_'re no_longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital , '' he_says . pemex , which produces 40_% of government revenue , desperately needs new investment . since world oil_prices collapsed in 1982 , the government has siphoned pemex 's coffers to make payments on mexico 's $ 97 billion foreign_debt . little money has_been returned 0 to upgrade pemex 's aging facilities . while the government drains pemex from above , the union has drained it from below . a bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused pemex 's operating costs to balloon to 95_cents of each $_1 in sales , far above the industry norm . the declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why mexico has_been importing gasoline this_year . some projections show mexico importing crude by the end of the century , barring an overhaul of operations . `` whatever you tried_to change , whether it was cutting_costs or attracting new partners , the big obstacle was the old union leadership , ''_says oil consultant george baker . enter mr._guzman cabrera , who has a clear understanding of where union_leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of president salinas . ``_i 'm the secretary-general , if there_is one , '' he_says , greeting a visitor to his office . beginning as a laborer in a refinery , mr._guzman cabrera put in more_than 40 years at pemex before being pushed into retirement by la_quina after a dispute two_years ago . though he also long benefited_from the system built by la_quina , mr._guzman cabrera says_0 union perks had simply gotten out of hand . they_are `` at the base of all of the problems of corruption , '' he_says 0 . thus , in recent contract_negotiations , mr._guzman cabrera gave_up the union 's right to assign 40_% of all of pemex 's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks . the union also ceded the 2_% commission 0 it had_received on all pemex maintenance contracts . -lrb- the union will keep a 2_% commission on construction projects . -rrb- the new contract also eliminates the $ 15 monthly coupon , good only at union-owned grocery stores , that was part_of the salary of every worker , from roughneck to chief_executive . about 9,800 technical workers , notably chemists and lawyers , were switched to non-union status . also , because of its reduced capital budget , pemex has phased_out about 50,000 transitory construction workers , reducing the work_force to about 140,000 , the union leader says_0 . mr._guzman cabrera says_0 the union 's sacrifices will_be offset_by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22_% increase in compensation . but pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract . ``_we are retaking the instruments of administration , ''_says raul robles , a pemex subdirector . pemex officials would n't say how_much money the new contract would save the company , but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $_500 million a year . pemex 's customers also are pleased_with the company 's new spirit . grupo desc , a big conglomerate , has long depended on pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material . but when the pemex plant shut_down for an annual overhaul , it would never give notice to its customers . `` the capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations , ''_says ernesto vega velasco , desc 's finance director . this_year , for the first_time , desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the pemex plant 's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience . taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals , which mexico has_been forced to import in large_quantities in recent_years . in may , the government unveiled new foreign_investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners , long limited to a 40_% stake_in secondary petrochemical companies , to own up to 100 % . later , the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products . but pemex 's courtship with private companies , and especially foreign ones , is controversial in a country where oil has_been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 . `` they_are preparing the workers for what 's coming : foreign control , '' wrote heberto castillo , a leftist leader . mr._guzman cabrera and government_officials insist_that foreigners will_be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products . but the new union leader makes no apologies for pemex 's more outward-looking attitude . `` if we_do not integrate into this new world of interdependence , sooner_or later we_'re going_to become victims of our_own isolation , '' he_says .
