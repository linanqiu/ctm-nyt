the crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a_lot more crowded . compaq_computer corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is_expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially zenith electronics corp. , the current market leader , and on a swarm of promising start-ups . compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend_toward downsizing in the personal_computer market . one manufacturer already_has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . '' but those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards 0 only a munchkin could love and screens 0 to match . compaq 's notebooks , by_contrast , may_be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines . analysts_say 0 they_'re faster and carry more memory than anything_else of their size on the market -- and they_'re priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $_5,000 . all of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases . in recent_months , compaq 's competition , including zenith , toshiba_corp. , tandy_corp. and nec_corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly . one_analyst , noting_that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . `` this is n't quite a notebook -- i call it a phonebook , '' he_says . that ca_n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few_weeks ago by grid systems corp. , a unit of tandy . instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability_to `` read '' block printing . at 4_1\/2 pounds , it may_be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind_of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth . palmtops are n't far behind . atari corp. 's portfolio , introduced in europe two_months ago and in the u.s. in early september , weighs less_than a pound , costs a mere $_400 and runs on three aa batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs . some critics , however , say its ability_to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory . poquet computer corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more_sophisticated palmtop that can run lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five_times as_much . at stake is what mike swavely , compaq 's president of north_america operations , calls `` the holy grail of the computer_industry '' -- the search_for `` a real computer in a package so small 0 you_can take it everywhere . '' the market is so new , 0 nobody knows yet how big it can_be . ``_i 've_had a_lot of people trying_to sell me services 0 to find_out how big it is , ''_says tom humphries , director of marketing for grid . `` whether it 's $_5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it_does n't matter . it 's huge . '' consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12_% of all personal_computer sales . laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal_computer segment , with sales doubling this_year . responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety_of compromises . making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory . it also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . the competitive sniping can_get pretty petty at times . a poquet spokesman , for_example , criticizes the atari portfolio because it requires three batteries while the poquet needs only two . both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue_that they_'re too small -- a problem 0 poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits 0 gerry purdy , director of marketing . poquet , trying_to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` the poquet pc -- a very big computer . '' despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do_n't make compromises . toward that end , experts_say 0 the real battle will_take place between center-stage players like toshiba , zenith and now compaq . compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like dynabook inc. , which introduced in june a computer that , like compaq 's , uses an intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard_disk drive . but the dynabook product is twice_as heavy and costs more_than compaq 's . compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for zenith , which last_year had 28_% of the u.s. laptop market but recently agreed_to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull , the french government-owned computer_maker . zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to zenith 's share and sales . compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market share . rod canion , compaq 's president and chief_executive officer , notes pointedly that zenith 's $_2,000 minisport uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk . john p. frank , president of zenith data_systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting_that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks . ``_we do_n't look_at it as not being a standard , we look_at it as a new standard , '' he argues . analysts do_n't see it that way . ``_i ca_n't imagine that you_'ll talk to anyone_who wo_n't tell_you 0 this is dynamite for compaq and a stopper for everyone_else , ''_says gene talsky , president of professional marketing management inc . adds bill lempesis , senior industry_analyst for dataquest , a high-technology market research_firm : ``_we basically think that these are very hot products . the problem 0 compaq is going_to have is that they wo_n't be_able to make enough of them . '' compaq 's machines include the 3 1\/2-inch floppy disk_drive , a backlit screen that is only 1\/4-inch thick and an_internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other_words , almost_all the capabilities of a typical office machine . others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts_believe 0 compaq has at_least a six-month lead on the competition . toshiba 's line of portables , for_example , features the t-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the t-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice_as much and is three_times the size . a third model , marketed in japan , may hit the u.s. by the end of the first_quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts_say 0 , compaq will have established itself as one of three major players . what about big blue ? international_business machines_corp. , analysts_say 0 , has_been burned twice in trying_to enter the laptop market and shows no_signs of trying_to get into notebooks anytime_soon .
