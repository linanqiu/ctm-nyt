a lack_of enthusiasm with the latest economic_data hampered the stock_market 's bid to extend tuesday 's sharp gains , as prices_closed slightly_higher in sluggish trading . while renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover_activity boosted several so-called deal stocks , traders_said 0 profit-taking weighed on the market , with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling . the dow_jones industrial_average , which had jumped 41.60 points on tuesday , drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90 . standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index added 0.84 to 341.20 ; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial_average . the dow_jones equity market index_gained 0.99 to 319.75 and the new_york stock_exchange composite_index went_up 0.60 to 188.84 . advancing stocks led decliners on the new_york stock_exchange by 847 to 644 . big_board volume amounted_to 154,240,000 shares , down from 176.1 million tuesday . the october survey of corporate purchasing_managers , as expected , provided evidence that economic_growth remains subdued . an index of economic_activity drawn from the survey stood last_month at 47.6 % ; a reading_above 50_% would_have indicated_that the manufacturing_sector was improving . but with the index proving somewhat better_than expected and the widely anticipated report on october employment scheduled to arrive tomorrow , stock_prices firmed only modestly in response to the report and then faltered . `` this market 's still going through its pains , '' said philip puccio , head of equity trading at_prudential-bache securities . `` the psychology is still : ` we_want -lrb- stocks -rrb- up , but if_they do_n't carry we_'re going_to sell them . ' '' uncertainty_about the prospects_for further action to curtail stock-index_arbitrage , a form of program_trading blamed for recent_volatility in the market , also contributed_to its lack_of direction , mr. puccio said_0 . arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close , which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue_chips . trading is_expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow 's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest_rates . ``_i sense that some people are_reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come_out , '' said richard eakle , president of eakle associates , fair haven , campbell_soup jumped_3 3\/8 to 47 1\/8 as the resignation of r. gordon mcgovern as president and chief_executive officer sparked a revival of rumors_that the company could become a takeover_target . prudential-bache_securities boosted the stock 's short-term investment rating in response to the departure ; analyst john mcmillin said_0 he_believes 0 the company will turn to new management `` that 's more financially oriented .
