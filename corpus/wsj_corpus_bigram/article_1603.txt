in another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in_september . meanwhile , the national_association of purchasing management said_0 its latest survey indicated_that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive_month . its index inched up to 47.6 % in october from 46_% in_september . any reading below_50 % suggests 0 the manufacturing_sector is generally declining . the purchasing_managers , however , also said that orders turned up in october after four_months of decline . factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in_september , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in_august , the commerce_department said_0 . if not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital_goods by defense contractors , factory orders would_have fallen 2.1 % . in a separate report , the department said_0 construction_spending ran at an annual_rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for august . private construction_spending was down , but government building activity was up . the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted_for inflation . kenneth mayland , economist for society corp. , a cleveland bank , said_0 demand_for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off . at the same_time , the drop in interest_rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry . `` what sector is stepping forward to pick_up the slack ? '' he asked . ``_i draw a blank . '' by most measures , the nation_'s industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all . factory payrolls fell in_september . so did the federal_reserve board 's industrial-production index . yet many_economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession . they cite a lack_of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn . inventories are closely_watched for such clues , for_instance . economists say_0 a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession . but yesterday 's factory orders report had good_news on that front : it said_0 factory inventories fell 0.1_% in_september , the first decline since february 1987 . `` this conforms to the ` soft_landing ' scenario , '' said elliott platt , an_economist at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette_securities corp . ``_i do_n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . '' a soft_landing is an economic_slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession . the department said_0 orders for nondurable goods -- those intended_to last fewer_than three_years -- fell 0.3_% in_september to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9_% the month before . orders for durable_goods were up 0.2_% to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9_% the month before . the department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1_% in_september . factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in_august . shipments have_been relatively level since_january , the commerce_department noted 0 . manufacturers_' backlogs of unfilled_orders rose 0.5_% in_september to $ 497.34 billion , helped by strength in the defense capital_goods sector . excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3_% . in its construction_spending report , the commerce_department said_0 residential construction , which accounts for nearly_half of all construction_spending , was off 0.9_% in_september to an annual_rate of $ 191.9 billion . david berson , economist for the mortgage bankers_association , predicted 0 the drop in interest_rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early_next year . spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6_% to an annual_rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength . government construction_spending rose 4.3_% to $ 88 billion . after adjusting for inflation , the commerce_department said_0 construction_spending did_n't change in_september . for the first_nine months of the year , total construction_spending ran about 2_% above last_year 's level . the government 's construction_spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill_inc. 's f.w. dodge group . dodge reported an 8_% increase in construction contracts awarded in_september . the goverment counts money as it is spent ; dodge counts contracts when they_are awarded . the government includes money spent on residential renovation ; dodge does_n't . although the purchasing_managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing_economy , it is n't signaling an_imminent recession , said_0 robert bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney_bowes inc. , stamford , conn . he said_0 the index would_have to be in the low 40_% range for several_months to be considered a forecast of recession . the report offered new evidence that the nation_'s export growth , though still continuing , may_be slowing . only 19_% of the purchasing_managers reported better export orders in october , down from 27_% in_september . and 8_% said_0 export orders were down last_month , compared_with 6_% the month before . the purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control . for the fifth consecutive_month , purchasing_managers said_0 prices for the goods 0 they purchased fell . the decline was even steeper than in_september . they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months . economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating . when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend_to rise . the purchasing_managers ' report is based_on data provided by more_than 250 purchasing executives . each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference_between the number_of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening . for the first_time , the october survey polled members on imports . it found that of the 73 % who import , 10_% said_0 they imported more in october and 12_% said_0 they imported less_than the previous_month . while acknowledging 0 one_month 's figures do_n't prove a trend , mr. bretz said , `` it_does lead you to suspect 0 imports are going down , or at_least not increasing that much . '' items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder . `` it 's an odd thing 0 to put on the list , '' mr. bretz noted . he said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk . they blamed increased demand_for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk , coupled_with very low import quotas . pamela sebastian in new_york contributed_to this_article . here are the commerce_department 's figures for construction_spending in billions of dollars at seasonally_adjusted annual rates . here are the commerce_department 's latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars , seasonally_adjusted .
