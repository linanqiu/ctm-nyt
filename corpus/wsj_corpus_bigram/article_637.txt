after years of quarreling over bonn 's `` ostpolitik '' , west_germany and the u.s. appear to have shifted onto a united course in eastern_europe . bonn and washington have_taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries , pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow_suit . both hope to encourage pressure for change in east_bloc countries still ruled by stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for poland , hungary and , to a lesser extent , the soviet_union . west_german officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for east_germany 's fledgling reform movement . `` the change taking_place in the soviet_union , poland and hungary has aroused new hope in both german states that reforms will_be undertaken in -lcb- east_germany -rcb- , and that relations_between the two german states , too , will get better , '' said foreign_minister hans-dietrich genscher . addressing a conference of the new_york-based institute for east-west security studies in frankfurt yesterday , mr. genscher said , `` history will judge us by whether we have_taken the opportunities that emerge_from these reforms . '' the ultimate aim of western support for east_bloc reforms , he said_0 , is to create `` an equitable and stable peaceful order in europe from the atlantic to the urals . '' mr. genscher and u.s. secretary of commerce robert_a. mosbacher , in separate speeches at the conference , appealed for more western contributions to economic_reforms and business development in hungary and poland . bonn and washington are leading supporters of poland 's_request for a $_1 billion stand-by credit from the international_monetary fund . ``_we want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in hungary and in poland to succeed . we are prepared to support those changes , '' said mr. mosbacher . u.s. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to east_bloc countries will_remain in place , however . meanwhile , the u.s. house of representatives yesterday approved an $ 837.5 million aid package for poland and hungary that more_than doubles the amount 0 president_bush had requested . the package was brought to the house just 15 days after it was introduced , indicating congress 's eagerness to reward poland and hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic_reforms . the legislation , approved 345-47 and sent to the senate , establishes two enterprise funds , 0 to be governed by independent nonprofit boards , which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in hungary and poland . the polish fund would_be seeded with $ 160_million , the hungarian fund with $_40 million . in_addition , a group of 24 industrialized countries , including the u.s. and japan and coordinated by the european_community commission , has promised poland and hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $_1.11 billion through the european investment_bank , while the ec plans $ 222 million in direct aid . when chancellor helmut_kohl travels to poland nov._9 , he is_expected to take with him a promise of three billion west_german marks_-lrb- $_1.6 billion -rrb- in new credit guarantees for industrial projects . last_week , bonn agreed_to reschedule 2.5_billion marks in polish debt that came due last_year . in_addition , a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off . poland 's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign_debt load of $ 39.2 billion . west_germany also has increased its credit guarantees to hungary by 500_million marks to 1.5_billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its_own economic_reforms , including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment . an_additional 500_million marks in credit-backing was promised by the west_german state governments of bavaria and baden-wuerttemberg . deutsche_bank ag , which last_year arranged a three billion mark credit for the soviet_union , is now moving to become the first west_german bank 0 to set_up independent business offices in hungary and poland as they shift to free-market economies . a maxim of frankfurt banking holds that wherever deutsche_bank goes , other west_german banks follow . indeed , at_least four other west_german banks are believed to be making inquiries .
