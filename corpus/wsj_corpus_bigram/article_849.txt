jaguar_plc 's chairman said_0 he hopes to reach a friendly pact with general_motors corp. within a month that may involve the british luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model . sir_john egan told_reporters at london 's motorfair yesterday 0 he `` would_be disappointed if we could_n't do -lcb- the deal -rcb- within a month . '' he said_0 the tie-up would mean_0 jaguar could `` develop cars down range -lcb- in price -rcb- from where we are '' by offering access to gm 's high-volume parts production . besides creating joint manufacturing ventures , the accord is_expected to give gm about a 15_% stake that eventually would rise to about 30_% . jaguar figures 0 a friendly alliance_with gm will fend_off unwelcome advances from ford_motor co . but ford , jaguar 's_biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to 10.4_% this_week , is pressing harder for talks_with sir_john . ``_we 're_getting to the point_where we are going_to have to meet '' with him , one ford official said_0 yesterday . ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon , he_added 0 . sir_john has spurned ford 's advances since the u.s._auto giant launched a surprise bid for as_much as 15_% of jaguar last_month . ford has signaled 0 it might acquire a majority interest later . ``_i 'm_not obligated to sit_down and talk to anybody , '' the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday . he did_n't rule_out negotiations_with ford , however . the fiercely proud but financially strapped british company prefers to remain_independent and publicly held , despite ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how . sir_john noted_that gm , a longtime jaguar supplier , agrees `` 0 we should remain an_independent company . '' he said_0 jaguar started negotiating_with gm and several other car makers over a year_ago , but the rest `` dropped by the wayside ever_since the share price went above # 4 -lrb- $ 6.30 -rrb- a_share . '' jaguar_shares stood_at 405 pence before ford 's initial announcement , but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up . the stock traded late_yesterday on london 's stock_exchange at 673 pence , up 19 pence . developing an executive-model range would mark a major departure for britain_'s leading luxury-car maker . a typical british executive car is mass produced and smaller_than a luxury_car . it generally fetches no more_than # 25,000 -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- -- roughly # 16,000 less_than the highest-priced jaguars , which are all known for their hand-crafted leather work . ``_we have designs for such -lcb- executive -rcb- cars , but have never been_able to develop them , '' sir_john said . gm 's help would `` make it possible -lcb- for jaguar -rcb- to build a wider range of cars . '' an executive model would significantly boost jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars . `` you are talking_about a couple hundred thousand a year , '' said bob barber , an auto-industry analyst_at u.k. brokerage james_capel &_co . a pact with gm may emerge in as little as two_weeks , according_to sources close to the talks . the deal would_require approval by a majority of jaguar_shareholders . ``_we have to make it attractive enough that -lcb- holders -rcb- would accept it , '' sir_john said . that may_be difficult , the jaguar chairman acknowledged 0 , `` when_you have somebody else breathing down your neck . '' ford probably would try_to kill the proposal by enlisting support from u.s. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later , said_0 stephen reitman , european auto analyst_at london brokers ubs phillips &_drew . ford ca_n't make a full-fledged bid for jaguar until u.k. government restrictions expire . the anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more_than 15_% of jaguar_shares without permission until_dec. 31 , 1990 . but with its 10.4_% stake , ford can convene a special jaguar_shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely . `` it 's a very valuable weapon in their armory , '' which could enable ford to bid sooner for jaguar , observed 0 mr. barber of james_capel . otherwise , jaguar may_have to tolerate the two u.s._auto giants each owning a 15_% stake for more_than a year . `` it would_be difficult to see_how a car company can_be owned_by a collective , '' sir_john said . `` it has never been done before , but there 's always a first .
