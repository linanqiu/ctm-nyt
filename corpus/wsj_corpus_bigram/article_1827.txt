despite politicians ' hand-wringing about the federal_budget , the government ended fiscal_1989 with a $ 152.08 billion deficit , about the same as the two previous years . even white_house budget_director richard_darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report . ``_i suppose 0 you could say_0 the good_news is that the deficits are not heading up , '' he said , `` but you_ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we_'re not . '' the federal deficit was $ 155.15 billion in 1988 and $ 149.69 billion in 1987 . the 1989 deficit would_have been nearly $ 10 billion larger had the government been_able to spend as_much as congress intended on cleaning_up the thrift industry before the year_ended on sept._30 . because the resolution_trust corp . could_n't spend the money fast enough , the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal_1990 . nevertheless , the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $ 136 billion target set by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law by $ 16 billion , a reminder of that law 's shortcomings . the law sets a deficit target of $_100 billion for fiscal_1990 . a partisan fight over cutting capital-gains_taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction_legislation almost to a halt , triggering across-the-board spending_cuts under the gramm-rudman law . the white_house and the democratic_leadership in congress blame each_other for turning capital-gains_taxes into such a divisive issue this_year . neither_side showed any sign of retreating . meeting with reporters friday , mr. darman again said_0 he would rather live with across-the-board spending_cuts than accept a deficit-reduction_bill like the one passed by the house , which would increase spending in future years . underscoring the size of the deficits of the past_few years , the treasury report showed that for the first_time interest paid on the public debt -- $ 240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on social_security , the single largest government program . in all , federal outlays amounted_to $ 1.143 trillion in 1989 , up 7.5_% from the previous_year , the treasury said_0 . federal revenues rose 9_% to $ 990.79 billion . the treasury said_0 a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did_n't turn_out to be quite as strong as it first appeared . the treasury marked up its forecast by $ 17 million in july , but that proved to be about $_5 billion too optimistic . the government ran a deficit of $ 6.16 billion in_september , compared_with a surplus of $ 10.17 billion in_september 1988 . outlays for the month totaled_$ 105.39 billion , up from $ 87.57 billion a year_earlier . the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as_well as payroll and social_security checks normally issued in october that were issued in_september this_year because oct._1 fell on a sunday . revenues were $ 99.23 billion , up from $ 97.74 billion a year_earlier .
