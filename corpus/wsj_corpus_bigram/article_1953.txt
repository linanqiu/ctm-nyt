we are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the `` americans with_disabilities act of 1989 '' was `` crafted primarily by democratic_senators kennedy and harkin '' with a premise `` based_on the presumption that most americans are hostile to the disabled ... . '' perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` it is surprising that george_bush and the white_house inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . '' this legislation was not drafted by a_handful of democratic `` do-gooders . '' quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the national council on the handicapped , all appointed by president_reagan . you depict the bill as something 0 democratic_leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing . the opposite is true : it 's the product of many meetings with administration_officials , senate staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials . many congressmen are citing the compromise on the `` americans with_disabilities act of 1989 '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations . most national council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with_disabilities . we_know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told 0 there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely hours at home because there_is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled . your_editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the `` lawyers_' employment act . '' for the 43 million people with_disabilities and their_families , this legislation is the `` emancipation proclamation . '' sandra swift parrino chairperson national council on the handicapped
