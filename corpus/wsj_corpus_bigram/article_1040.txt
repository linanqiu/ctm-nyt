eastern_airlines ' creditors_committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law_proceedings , asked its_own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization . representatives of the accounting_firm of ernst_& young and the securities_firm of goldman , sachs_& co. , hired by creditors to consult on eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that eastern 's latest plan to emerge_from bankruptcy-law_protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors_' approval . according_to one_person present at the meeting , eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . '' asked about the consultants ' reports , an eastern spokeswoman_said 0 ``_we totally disagree . '' she said_0 they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . '' at a later news_conference here , frank lorenzo , chairman of eastern 's parent texas_air corp. , said_0 eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back_into operation and predicted 0 it would emerge_from chapter_11 protection_from creditors early_next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled . he insisted , as he has before , that creditors would_be paid in full under the plan . mr._lorenzo made no mention of creditors_' negative response to his plan . ``_we 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' mr._lorenzo told_reporters . ``_we 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he_added . in july , eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization_plan that called for eastern to sell $_1.8 billion in assets and to emerge_from bankruptcy-law_protection at two-thirds its former size . but after selling off pieces such_as its east_coast shuttle , its philadelphia hub and various planes , eastern hit a stumbling block . it could_n't sell its south american routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal . those routes , valued by the creditors_' professionals at about $_400 million , were to be_sold to amr_corp. 's american_airlines . a last-minute snag in negotiations_with amr , over an unrelated lawsuit between american and another texas_air unit , caused the deal to collapse . eastern ultimately decided 0 it would_have to_keep and operate the routes itself , which would_leave it with less cash for its reorganization . it also would_leave eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan . those changes in its condition meant 0 the reorganization_plan previously presented to creditors would_have to be revamped . since_then , eastern has_been negotiating_with creditors over revisions , but the creditors_committee has_been having problems with the revisions . the committee has two_groups of experts 0 it calls on to analyze eastern 's plans . both said_0 the new plan would n't work . ernst_& young said_0 eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $_100 million , and that eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according_to a source present at yesterday 's session . experts from goldman_sachs estimated 0 eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120_million to $ 135 million , the source said . the experts said_0 they expected 0 eastern would_have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far_less cash than 0 anticipated . other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because eastern has an older fleet . at the news_conference , mr._lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes presented a far rosier assessment . flanked by flight_attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said_0 eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats . starting next_month , eastern will_begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously_announced 700 , they said_0 . mr. bakes declined to give out eastern 's daily losses , but said_0 he did_n't expect 0 eastern would_have to dip into the cash from asset_sales currently held in escrow . these accounts hold several_hundred million dollars , primarily from asset_sales . the plan 0 eastern hopes to_pursue , he said_0 , calls_for eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end . both he and mr._lorenzo predicted 0 that plan might_be confirmed in january . as to negotiations_with creditors , mr._lorenzo said in remarks after the conference `` 0 we_'ll have to see_how they -lcb- talks -rcb- come along . '' however , he_added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors . it must_be accepted by the court . '' under bankruptcy law , eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its_own reorganization_plan . that deadline has_been extended once and could_be extended again . if eastern can_get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could_be relatively swift . but creditors are free to press for court approval of their_own plan , or the court could ignore both_sides and draw its_own . in any_event , some people_familiar with the case question_whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr._lorenzo and mr. bakes . eastern sought bankruptcy-law_protection a few_days after a crippling strike began march 4 . mr._lorenzo told_reporters 0 the reorganization 0 eastern is pursuing would_create a carrier 85_% to 90_% of the size of the pre-bankruptcy eastern . he projected 0 it would_be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only_slightly fewer_than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day .
