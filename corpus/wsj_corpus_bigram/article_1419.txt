the first major event this_morning in u.s. stock and futures_trading may_be a pause at the chicago_mercantile exchange . under a reform arising from the 1987_crash , trading in the merc 's stock-index_futures will break for 10_minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday_'s close , a move equal to 40 points on the dow_jones industrial_average . the aim of the interruption would_be to ease the opening of the new_york stock_exchange , which would_be hammered by such a volatile move on the merc . that early-morning breather is just one of a number_of safeguards adopted after the 1987_crash . the big_board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading_volume . several of those post-crash changes kicked in during friday_'s one-hour collapse and worked as expected , even_though they_did n't prevent a stunning plunge . but the major `` circuit_breakers '' have yet to be evaluated . a deeper market_plunge today could give_them their first test . a further slide also would resurrect debate_over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task_force , which analyzed the 1987_crash , would_be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury_secretary . the most_controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such_as setting consistent margin_requirements for the stock and futures_markets . but for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said_0 the circuit_breakers worked as intended . big_board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard_& poor_'s 500 contract , as_well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. cdt and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher_than their frozen levels . during the first halt , after the s&p index had_fallen 12 points , the big_board 's `` sidecar '' computer program automatically was_triggered . that system is designed to separate computer-generated program_trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual_stocks . one merc broker compared the action in the s&p pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school . `` you_do n't_want the fire but you_know what to do , '' said howard dubnow , an_independent floor broker and a merc governor . `` there was no panic . the system worked the way_0 we devised it to work . '' after reopening for about 15_minutes , the s&p index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went_into effect . traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the dow would drop 250 points , '' mr. dubnow added 0 , referring_to the level at which the stock_market itself would_have closed for an_hour . one observer estimated that 80_% to 90_% of the s&p traders `` were just standing around watching . '' but the 250-point circuit_breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the chicago_board of trade 's major market index also were n't triggered . the mmi and the s&p_500 are the two major indexes used by program_traders to run their computerized trading_strategies . the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987_crash . the process of post-crash reforms began with calls 0 to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments . in october_1987 , just after the market drop , washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way_0 the financial_markets are structured and regulated . over the next_year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps 0 to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time 0 to pause and reconsider positions . in_addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures_markets . few changes were made in the way_0 the markets are regulated . at the outset the prime target was program_trading , which was much discussed but little understood on_capitol hill . there_were also calls 0 to strip the stock_markets of `` derivative '' products , such_as stock-index_futures and options , which federal_judge stanley sporkin , for_example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . '' and there was much criticism of the new_york stock_exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market_makers . when the brady task_force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in january 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda . arguing_that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task_force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit_breakers . only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . the reagan white_house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the working group on the financial_markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . in may 1988 , the working group , made up of representatives from the federal_reserve , the treasury , the securities and exchange_commission , and the commodity_futures trading commission , finally endorsed only circuit_breakers . after several more months of arguments among various stock_exchanges and futures_markets , circuit_breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the dow_jones industrial_average . privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . after all , this free-market argument went 0 , the dow only dropped more_than 250 points once this century . `` circuit_breakers '' set to soften big drops : -- if s&p_futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10_minutes . -- if dow_industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10_minutes . -- if s&p_futures fall 12 points -lrb- equivalent to about 100 points on djia -rrb- , trading is frozen for half_hour to that price or higher . on nyse program_trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell_orders . -- if s&p_futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an_hour to that price or higher . -- if dow_industrials fall 250 points , trading on the big_board halts for an_hour . s&p and mmi contracts also halt . -- if djia drops 400 points , big_board halts trading for two_hours . trading in mmi and s&p_futures also halted . brady task_force recommendations -lrb- jan. 1988 -rrb- : -- establish an overarching regulator for financial_markets -- unify trade-clearing systems -- make margins consistent across stock and futures_markets sec proposals -lrb- may 1988 -rrb- : -- require prompt reports of large securities trades . -- give sec authority to monitor risk-taking by affiliates of brokerage_firms . -- transfer

congressional proposal : -- create a task_force 0 to review current state of the securities markets and securities_laws . breaking the soviet government 's television monopoly , an_independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including american films . `` there must not be a monopoly , there must_be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' nikolai i. lutsenko , the president of the nika tv company , told the weekly_newspaper nedelya . the company is already working on its_own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said_0 . mr. lutsenko told nedelya that he recently had_been to the u.s. to pick_up the rights to show 5,000 u.s. films in the soviet_union . nedelya 's article was accompanied_by a picture of mr. lutsenko interviewing singer john denver in colorado . even_though it will_be independent of official television , nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the communist youth league . south_africa 's national union of mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at de_beers consolidated mines ltd. de_beers said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said_0 was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines . the deadlock in negotiations occurred with de_beers offering a 17_% increase in the minimum-wage category while the union demanded a 37.6 %_increase in the minimum_wage . japan 's opposition socialist_party denied that its legislators had_been bribed by pinball-parlor owners . the allegation had_been raised in parliament by the governing liberal democratic party following magazine reports suggesting_that money from japanese-style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics . tsuruo yamaguchi , secretary general of the socialist_party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had_received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen_-lrb- about $ 55,000 -rrb- but said_0 the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry . the world wide fund for nature said that spain , argentina , thailand and indonesia were doing too little 0 to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders . a report by the conservation group presented at the u.n.-sponsored convention on international_trade in endangered species in lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging_from parakeets to orchids . fund official simon lyster said_0 world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $_5 billion of business annually . a nato project 0 to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations . britain , france and italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while east-west disarmament talks show signs of success . small wonder that britain_'s labor_party wants credit controls . a few_hours after the party launched its_own affinity credit_card earlier_this month , the tories raised the nation_'s base interest_rate . labor 's visa card is believed to be the first linked to a british political party . labor gets 25 pence_-lrb- 39_cents -rrb- for every 100 -lrb- about $_155 -rrb- that a user charges to the card . as with other plastic in britain_'s high-interest-rate environment , the labor card , administered by co-operative bank , carries a stiff -lrb- in this case , 29.8 % -rrb- annual_rate on the unpaid balance . china_'s year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic_growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets . the official china daily said_0 retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last_december but acknowledged 0 that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . the state_statistical bureau found that more_than 1_billion yuan -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- was spent in the first_half of the year for pork subsidies . the newspaper quoted experts as saying_0 the subsidies would cause the difference_between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . '' the aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic_growth , which soared to 20.7 % last_year , to 8_% in 1990 . economists now predict 0 the growth_rate will_be about 11.5_% for the year . in a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , russian orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the moscow patriarchate in the kremlin 's 15th-century uspensky cathedral , where czars were crowned ... . a 34-foot-tall , $ 7.7_million statue of buddha was completed on a hill outside hong_kong , facing china . the statue is the brainchild of sik chi wan , director of the po lin monastery , who said : `` hong_kong is such a prosperous place , 0 we also need some_kind of religious symbol .
