the federal communications commission allowed american_telephone &_telegraph co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said_0 it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market . the fcc moves were good_news for at&t , which has_been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation . alfred sikes , the new fcc chairman , championed deregulation of at&t at his last job as head of a commerce_department telecommunications agency . but it has_been an open question_whether mr. sikes , an extraordinarily cautious man , would_continue pushing deregulation at the fcc in the face of what is_likely to be great political pressure . `` it means that sikes is serious_about the deregulation of long distance , '' said jack grubman , a telecommunications analyst_at painewebber_inc. , who_attended the fcc meeting . `` all the commissioners were in amazing agreement -lcb- to re-examine regulation -rcb- for only having been together for a few_months . '' the fcc took three specific actions regarding at&t . by a 4-0 vote , it allowed at&t to continue offering special discount packages to big customers , called tariff 12 , rejecting appeals by at&t competitors that the discounts were illegal . then by a separate 4-0 vote , it chose the narrowest possible grounds 0 to strike down a different discount plan , called tariff 15 , that at&t offered to holiday corp . at&t gave a 5_% to 10_% discount to the memphis , tenn. , company that oversees holiday inns , in response to a similar discount offered to holiday corp. by mci_communications corp . the agency said that because mci 's offer had expired at&t could_n't continue to offer its discount plan . but the agency specifically did_n't rule whether at&t had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users . indeed , joe nacchio , at&t 's vice_president for business-communications services , said_0 at&t offered a similar tariff 15 discount to resort condominium international , of indianapolis , to meet another mci bid . the fcc `` did_n't say_0 i could_n't do it again , '' he said . apart from those two actions , mr. sikes and the three other commissioners said_0 they_expect to re-examine how at&t is regulated since competition has increased . richard firestone , chief of the fcc 's common-carrier bureau , said_0 he expected the agency to propose new rules next_year . at&t applauded the fcc 's actions . `` the time is long overdue 0 to take a look_at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the new_york telecommunications firm said in a statement . but mci , of washington , was displeased with the fcc decision concerning tariff 12 , arguing_that `` at&t can_not be_allowed to flaunt fcc rules . '' united telecommunications inc. 's us sprint unit said_0 it was ``_obviously disappointed '' with the fcc decision on tariff 12 . us sprint said was 0 it will petition the fcc decision in federal_court . ``_we believe_that the court will find it unlawful , '' said a us sprint spokesman . separately , at&t filed a countersuit against mci accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising . the at&t action was the most_recent blow in a nasty fight . earlier_this month , mci sued at&t in federal_district court , claiming that at&t 's ads are false . at&t assembled three of its top_executives in washington , all visibly angry , to try_to refute mci 's charges . `` mci has made hawks out of the upper echelon of at&t , '' said painewebber 's mr. grubman , who said_0 he expected at&t to become increasingly aggressive in dealing_with its longtime nemesis . julie amparano lopez in philadelphia also contributed_to this_article .
