a house-senate_conference approved a permanent smoking_ban on all domestic_airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii . the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking_ban on flights of two_hours or less . the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent_years . by a 6-4 margin , house negotiators initially rejected last_night a senate provision covering all domestic flights . but the six-hour compromise was soon agreed_to in subsequent discussions . as a practical matter , flights from the west_coast to hawaii would_be covered as they_are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for_example , in chicago or on the east_coast . within the senate , the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank lautenberg -lrb-_d. , n.j. -rrb- , who has used his_position as a senate_appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative . the measure is attached to the more_than $ 26 billion fiscal_1990 transportation bill within mr. lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more_than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as_well as funds sought_by major airports , including denver . from the outset , the tobacco industry has_been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . but the industry retains support in the house leadership through the influence of grower states , such_as north_carolina . majority whip william gray owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the house , and the philadelphia democrat used his_position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . although the smoking provision has attracted the most public_interest , the underlying_bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact_on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the house deliberately killed a_handful of projects backed_by lawmakers in florida , illinois and pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the house floor . `` anybody can vote as they_want , '' said rep. william lehman -lrb-_d. , fla. -rrb- , head of the house conferees . `` but if_you make a request , you should support the committee . '' within the federal_aviation administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more_than 20_% from last_year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12_% boost . the facilities account includes $_40 million for denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver , united and continental . leery of the costs -- and , critics_say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver . texas_air corp. , which_owns continental , and the air_transport association were prominent in the lobbying . the industry sought to impose conditions that would_have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed_to leases for 50_% of the gates . but this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the transportation_department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $_2 billion . though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed_to preserve an_estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports . the sum is more_than double what the house had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would_be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits_on the level of subsidy . congress previously cut six airports this_year . the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has_been paying more_than $_200 for each passenger in subsidies . among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for amtrak , including $ 85_million for capital improvements . and federal-formula grants for mass transit would_be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more_than last fiscal_year .
