many investors give michael foods about as_much chance of getting it together as humpty dumpty . but now at_least there 's a glimmer of hope for the stock . burger_king , which breaks thousands_of fresh eggs each morning , is quietly switching over to an_alternative egg product made by michael foods . known_as easy eggs , the product has disappointed investors . when the company this_month announced lower-than-forecast sales of easy eggs , the stock dropped nearly 19_% . michael wo_n't confirm the identities of any easy egg customers , nor will it say much of anything_else . two minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top_officers of making `` various untrue statements . '' these federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing_to disclose that easy eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of michael 's production_capacity . but at_least burger_king has signed on , and says that by year end it wo_n't be using any shell eggs . the miami fast-food_chain , owned_by grand_metropolitan of britain , expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually . so there_is reason 0 to believe_that michael 's hopes for a bacteria-free , long-shelf-life egg were n't all hype . -lrb- easy eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process . -rrb- still , caution is advisable . a company official says_0 michael 's break-even volume on easy eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well_above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested 0 was a billion-pound market waiting_for such a product . perhaps to debunk the analysts_' talk of over-capacity , michael today will_take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new gaylord , minn. , plant . there has_been no announcement of the burger_king arrangement by either party , possibly for fear that mcdonald_'s and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising . but burger_king operators independently confirm using michael 's product . other institutional users reportedly include marriott , which is moving away_from fresh eggs on a region-by-region basis . the extent of marriott 's use is n't known , and marriott officials could_n't be_reached for comment . michael foods has attracted a good many short-sellers , the people_who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender . many analysts question management 's credibility . `` the stock , in my opinion , is going_to go lower , not_only because of disappointing_earnings but -lcb- because -rcb- the credibility gap is certainly_not closing , ''_says l. craig carver of dain bosworth . mr. carver says that at a recent dain-sponsored conference in new_york , he asked michael 's chief_executive officer if the fourth_quarter would_be down . the ceo , richard g. olson , replied `` yes , '' but would n't_elaborate . -lrb- the company did_n't put out a public announcement . a spokesman_said later that mr. olson was being `` conservative '' in his estimate . but the spokesman added that while michael will earn less_than last_year 's $_1.20 a_share , it thinks_0 street estimates of $_1 or so are low . -rrb- analyst robin young of john kinnard &_co. , minneapolis , calls himself `` the last remaining bull on the stock . '' he argues_that michael foods is misunderstood : `` this is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed , like finding a white rhino . '' earnings are n't keeping pace , he_says 0 , because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business . mr. carver , however , believes_0 the company 's egg product wo_n't help the bottom_line in the short run , even_though it `` makes_sense -- it 's more convenient '' and justifies its price , which is higher_than shell eggs , because of health and sanitation concerns . prospective competition is one problem . last_week a closely_held new_jersey concern , papetti high-grade egg products co. , rolled out an aseptically packaged liquefied item called table ready . company president steve papetti says_0 marriott will_be among his clients as_well . michael shares_closed at 13_3\/4 yesterday in national_over-the-counter trading . says new_york-based short seller mark cohodes , `` in my_mind this is a $ 7 stock . '' michael late_yesterday announced a $_3.8 million stock buy-back_program . michael , which also processes potatoes , still relies_on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly_half its pretax_profit . but dry growing conditions in the red river valley of minnesota and north dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what michael contracted to pay last_spring . company lawyers recently sent letters to growers saying that michael `` would take very seriously any effort ... to divert its contracted-for potatoes to other outlets . '' still , analysts_believe that profit_margins in the potato business will_be down again this_year .
