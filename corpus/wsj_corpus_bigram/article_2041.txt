finnish government_officials are negotiating_with creditors of waertsilae_marine oy , a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy_protection this_week , amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation_'s entire shipbuilding industry can_be averted . at stake are almost 10,000 jobs in an industry that has_been the mainstay of finland 's post-war economic revival . shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe . but if , as many now fear , waertsilae_marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn_out to be remembered most as a blemish on finland 's international reputation . the shipyard 's 6.5_billion finnish markka -lrb- $ 1.54 billion -rrb- backlog includes about 20 ships ordered by big international shippers , including three for carnival_cruise lines inc . miami-based carnival said_0 the first of the three ships is_scheduled to be_delivered next_month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean . the second ship is_scheduled to be_delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991 . one_analyst said_0 the first ship probably will_be delivered close to schedule , but that carnival may_have to pay up to 25_% more to get the second and third ships . all the ships are covered_by loan_guarantees from a state export financing agency , even_though it 's not clear whether they will actually be_built . bankers worry_that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments , shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits . state loan_guarantees are rarely a source of controversy . however , some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae_marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned kongsberg vappenfabrikk as two_years ago . in that case , international banks and investors incurred big losses because_they incorrectly believed 0 the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees . doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders , analysts warn 0 . moreover , state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial_markets , bankers_say 0 . the decision by a majority of state-appointed waertsilae_marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy . in_august , the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard . at the time 71%-controlled by oy waertsilae , a conglomerate , the shipbuilding unit faced potential_losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation . under the rescue plan , waertsilae sold 51_% of its stake to a group of banks and pension_funds . the government , in turn , guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took_control of the board . government_officials were expected to combine waertsilae_marine with two other struggling firms , and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation . the government spent most of last_year attempting_to carry_out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent waertsilae concern pulled_out at the last_minute . after the restructuring of waertsilae_marine and bolstered_by state loan_guarantees , two big bank creditors , union bank of finland and state-controlled postipankki , resumed lending the shipyard working_capital . but the bankers got cold feet recently as government_officials complained 0 they had_been misled about the shipyard 's actual financial_condition , and hinted 0 the credit guarantees might_be withdrawn . people_familiar with monday 's board_meeting said_0 it was the state 's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led union bank and postipankki to halt lending to waertsilae_marine . then , in a boardroom showdown , state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy , apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister ilkka suominen . analysts_say 0 mr. suominen had grown increasingly worried_about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae_marine 's losses ballooned to more_than double the figure estimated in_august . noting_that sweden wound up wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion swedish kronor_-lrb- $ 5.47 billion -rrb- during the 1970s in a vain attempt_to salvage its shipbuilding industry , one_analyst suggested_that mr. suominen may_have decided to cut finland 's losses once and for all . senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an_attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae_marine operating . the talks may drag_on for weeks before any concrete result is announced , people_familiar with them said_0 . one solution would_be to sell the shipyard to an outsider . but there appear to be few , if any , suitors . indeed , the potential_losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once_again change tack and agree to pick_up the bill , analysts said_0 . meantime , shippers with vessels on order from waertsilae_marine will_remain in limbo .
