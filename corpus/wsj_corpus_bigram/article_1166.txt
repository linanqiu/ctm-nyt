the roller-coaster stock_market is making life tougher for small_companies trying_to raise money . in the wake_of friday_'s plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already postponing deals , and others wish 0 they could . as in other jittery times , many_small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . even_if stock_prices fully recover from friday_'s sharp_decline , the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors . `` the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , ''_says henry linsert jr. , chairman of martek corp. , a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private_placement of stock . `` the more variables that indicate risk , the more 0 the investor is going_to drive a hard bargain . '' earlier_this month , staples inc. , a newton , mass. , office-supplies discounter , said_0 it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public . at the time , its shares were selling above their initial_offering price of $ 19 , and bankers believed 0 staples would sell new stock without a hitch . but with the company 's shares standing at $ 15 yesterday , a new offering seems unlikely , company officials_say 0 . business , however , continues to be `` robust , '' and the stock_market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans , says_0 todd krasnow , a senior_executive . other companies figure 0 they ca_n't avoid the market . ``_we have capital_requirements , ''_says 0 mr. linsert , `` so we have to go_ahead '' with a planned $_1.5 billion private_placement . unless the market goes right back up , he_says 0 , `` it may take us six to nine_months to find the money , instead of three . '' and the columbia , md. , company may_have to_settle for a lower price , he_adds 0 . life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this_week . hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement . robertson , stephens &_co. , a san_francisco investment_banking concern , has a client that looked forward to making its initial_public offering yesterday . officers of the company , a health-care concern , `` were very discouraged on friday and felt 0 they should n't go public ; we felt 0 they should , ''_says 0 sanford robertson , partner in the banking_concern . as the market dropped friday , robertson stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7_% . yesterday , when similar securities rebounded , it bumped the valuation up again . as of late_yesterday , the ipo was still on . for many , the situation is especially discouraging because the market for ipos was showing_signs of strengthening after several_years of weakness . ``_we were just beginning to look_at the increase in ipos , seeing the light at the end of the tunnel , ''_says frank kline jr. , partner in lambda funds , a beverly_hills , calif. , venture_capital concern . `` but the tunnel 's just gotten longer . '' companies planning to go public `` are definitely taking a second look , ''_says 0 allen hadhazy , senior analyst_at the institute for econometric research , fort lauderdale , fla. , which publishes the new issues newsletter on ipos . he calculates that the recent market slide translated_into a 5_% to 7_% reduction in ipo proceeds to companies . many companies are hesitating . exabyte corp. had_been planning to sell 10_% of its stock this_week in an ipo that would raise up to $ 28.5 million . but now , peter behrendt , president , says , ``_we 're_making decisions on a day-to-day basis . '' debt-free and profitable , the boulder , colo. , computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an ipo now , he_says 0 . knowledgeware inc. , an atlanta computer-software concern , says_0 it is still planning to go_ahead with its ipo this_week or next -- unless conditions change . `` it 's a wait-and-see situation right_now , ''_says terry mcgowan , president . delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies . sierra tucson cos. , a tucson , ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an ipo scheduled for next_week . william o'donnell , president , says_0 he still thinks_0 the ipo will_succeed . if it_does n't , he_says 0 , the company would_have to change its expansion timetable . but the market turmoil could_be partially beneficial for some small_businesses . in a sagging market , the federal_reserve system `` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest_rates down , ''_says 0 leonard t. anctil , vice_president of the bank of new_england , boston . james g. zafris , president of danvers savings_bank , danvers , mass. , says_0 the market turmoil `` is an absolute non-event for small_business . '' for small_companies , he_says 0 , interest_rates are far_more important than what_happens on stock_exchanges . mr. zafris thinks_0 rates are heading down , helping small_companies . peter drake , biotechnology analyst for vector securities international , chicago , thinks_0 market uncertainty may encourage small_companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . partly_because the 1987 market_crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently . some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds . alan wells , president of bollinger , wells , lett &_co. , a new_york merger specialist , thinks_0 panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged_buy-out and giant takeover deals . instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he_says 0 . and william_e. wetzel jr. , a university of new_hampshire management professor and director of venture_capital network inc. , says_0 the market 's gyrations will underline the investors_' lack_of control in big stock investments . this will add to the appeal of small_business , he_says 0 , where investors often have a degree of influence .
