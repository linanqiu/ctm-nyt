democratic_leaders have bottled up president_bush 's capital-gains_tax cut in the senate and may_be able_to prevent a vote_on the issue indefinitely . senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- said_0 he intends_to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax_cut to come_up with at_least 60 votes before they_can address the issue . and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can_produce enough_votes . `` the 60-vote requirement will_be there and they do_n't have the 60 votes , '' sen._mitchell said . `` they do_n't have the votes 0 to get it passed . '' sen. bob packwood -lrb-_r. , ore. -rrb- , the leading republican proponent of the tax_cut , did_n't disagree . ``_i 'm_not sure what 's going_to happen , '' he said . previously he had said_0 he would_be able_to find the requisite 60 votes eventually . sen. packwood has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill , now pending in the senate , that would authorize aid to poland and hungary . democrats are holding up a vote_on the amendment by threatening a filibuster , or extended debate . for a cloture vote to stop the filibuster , republicans must muster at_least 60 votes . yesterday , sen. packwood acknowledged , ``_we do_n't have the votes for cloture today . '' the republicans show no_sign of relenting . gop leaders continued to press for a vote_on the amendment to the eastern_europe aid measure . and they threatened to try_to amend any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital-gains_provision . `` this is serious business ; we_'re serious_about a capital-gains reduction , '' said kansas sen. robert_dole , the senate 's republican leader . `` the strategy is ` let 's vote . ' '' the republicans contend_that they_can garner a majority in the 100-member senate for a capital-gains_tax cut . they accuse the democrats of unfairly using senate rules to erect a 60-vote hurdle . democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their_own ends . the two_sides also traded accusations about the cost of the packwood_plan . democrats asserted that the proposal , which also would_create a new type of individual_retirement account , was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long_run . republicans countered that long-range revenue estimates were unreliable . the packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending_on how_long an asset was held . it also would_create a new ira that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide_variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first-home purchases and tuition . a white_house spokesman_said 0 president_bush is `` generally supportive '' of the packwood_plan .
