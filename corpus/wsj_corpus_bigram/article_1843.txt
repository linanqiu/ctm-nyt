wives may_not benefit when men do chores when husbands take on more housework , they tend_to substitute for chores done by the kids rather_than by the wife . rand corp. researchers linda waite and frances goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at_least one child at home between the ages of six and 18 . the women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share 0 each did . not unexpectedly , wives , whether working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80_% of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two-thirds of housecleaning , washing dishes , child_care and family paper_work . only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less_than half . but the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden appreciably , the husband 's helping hand `` appears to lighten the children 's load almost on a one-for-one basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly . '' this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples . in these families , husbands took on 80_% more chores than in couples with only grammar school education . but the kids with highly educated parents did 68_% less housework than those in less-educated families . `` it is clear , '' ms. waite says_0 , `` that most of the effect of increasing education has_been to shift who is helping the wife\/mother . her share decreases , but only_slightly . '' nursing home patients apt to be private payers far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed , two recent studies declare 0 . state governments place very low ceilings on how_much property people may own or how_much income they may keep if_they want welfare help on medical bills . conventional_wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for medicaid assistance . but separate reports from joshua weiner and denise spence of the brookings institution and korbin liu of the urban institute find that `` a surprisingly small proportion '' -- only about 10_% -- of residents start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged . -lrb- another one-third are already on medicaid when they enter the nursing homes , a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated . -rrb- but a remarkably high percentage -- over half -- are private payers throughout their stay , even a fairly lengthy one . about_one-third pay out of their_own pockets , while the rest are covered throughout by medicare , private insurers or the veterans administration . both reports are based_on several thousand patients sampled in a 1985 nationwide government survey . the brookings and urban institute authors caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and reaching the medicaid level is more likely with an_unusually long stay or repeated stays . moreover , they note 0 , those_who manage to pay their_own way often do_so only by selling their homes , using up life savings or drawing heavily_on children and other relatives . reagan era young hold liberal views the reagan generation young_men and women reaching political maturity during ronald_reagan 's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender , according_to norc , the social science research_center at the university of chicago . many political analysts have speculated_that the reagan years would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation . norc 's most_recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-reagan and pro-republican than other adults . but , says_0 chief investigator tom smith , this `` does_not translate_into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil_rights issues . '' answers to a dozen questions in the 1986 , 1987 , 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in norc 's polling in the early_1970s and early_1980s . they_were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys . for_example , 66 % of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an `` open housing '' law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers . that compares_with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55_% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys . asked_whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women , 70_% of the reagan generation disagreed , compared_with under 60_% of younger men and women in the earlier years . odds and ends separated and divorced men and women are far_more likely_to be smokers than married persons , the centers for disease control discovers 0 ... . graduate students are taking longer than_ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees , the national research council says_0 . it estimates 0 the time between college graduation and the awarding of a ph. d. has lengthened by 30_% over the past 20_years , with the average gap now ranging_from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education .
