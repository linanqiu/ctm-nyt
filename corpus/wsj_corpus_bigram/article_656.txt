the prices of corn_futures contracts jumped amid rumors_that the soviet_union is keeping up its dizzying october buying binge of u.s._corn . those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading_yesterday when the u.s. agriculture_department announced that the soviets had bought 1.2_million metric_tons of u.s._corn , bringing their u.s._corn purchases confirmed so_far this_month to about five million metric_tons . in trading at the chicago_board of trade , the corn contract for december_delivery jumped 5.75 cents_a bushel to_settle at $ 2.44 a_bushel . the soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some_analysts had expected the soviet_union to buy this_fall , the season in which it usually buys much of the corn 0 it imports from the u.s. . that pace is causing some_analysts to speculate that the soviet_union might soon purchase as_much as another two million metric_tons . one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that u.s. grain companies yesterday bought an_unusually large amount of corn_futures contracts . that sometimes signals that they_are laying plans to export corn . by some estimates , several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric_tons of corn . by buying futures_contracts , these companies attempt_to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they_are obligated to deliver . rumors of soviet interest also pushed_up the prices of soybean futures_contracts . among_other things , the agriculture_department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the soviet_union . on top of all this , corn and soybean prices_rose on reports that the midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of indiana and ohio . the harvest delays , however , are_expected to be temporary . balmy temperatures are forecast for next_week , said_0 robert lekberg , an_analyst at farmers grain & livestock corp. , chicago . many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies . the heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally . wheat futures_prices rose_slightly . in other_commodity markets yesterday : precious_metals : futures_prices declined . a number_of developments were negatively interpreted by traders . december_delivery gold fell $ 1.80 an_ounce to $ 370.60 . december_silver eased 2.7 cents an_ounce to $ 5.133 . january_platinum was down $ 3.60 an_ounce at $ 491.10 . one price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2_% in the consumer_price index for september , an_analyst said_0 . he_noted that the `` core inflation_rate , '' which excludes food and energy , was also low at 0.2_% . other news that weighed on the market : initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last_week ; american_telephone &_telegraph co. will reduce_its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition ; the oil market turned weaker ; there was n't any investor_demand for bullion ; and the dollar strengthened during the day , putting pressure_on gold . also , the analyst said_0 , economic circumstances are such that both south_africa and the soviet_union , the principal gold and platinum producers , are_being forced to continue selling the metals . both are in great need of foreign_exchange , and south_africa is also under_pressure to meet foreign loan commitments , he said_0 . `` putting it all together , we have a negative scenario that does_n't look_like it will improve overnight , '' he said . copper : futures_prices recovered in quiet_trading . the december_contract rose 1.50 cents_a pound to $ 1.2795 . that contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three_days of this_week , mostly in reaction to last_friday 's stock_market plunge , which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the u.s._economy and thus reduced demand_for copper , a leading industrial metal . in recent_days , however , there has_been increased purchasing of copper in london , an_analyst said_0 . some of this buying was by japan , which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the bougainville mine in papua new guinea , highland_valley mine in british_columbia , and the cananea mine in mexico , which are major shippers to japan . the increasing likelihood that cananea and highland_valley will soon return to production may_have cut some of that purchasing , but even_if any of these mines begin operating soon , their output wo_n't be significant until at_least the end of the year , analysts note 0 . so , one_analyst said , even_though the long-term production problems may_be easing , there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three_months , when inventories will_remain relatively low . energy : crude_oil prices ended mixed . west_texas intermediate for november_delivery fell 14 cents_a barrel to $ 20.42 . but so-called outer month contracts finished higher . for_instance , december contracts for wti rose_17 cents to $ 20.42 . most energy futures opened lower , following wednesday 's market downturn . but a flurry of late trading_yesterday beefed up prices . heating_oil and gasoline futures ended higher as_well .
