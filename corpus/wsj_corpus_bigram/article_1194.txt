should you really own stocks ? that 's a question 0 a_lot of people are asking , following the stock_market 's stunning display of volatility . whipsawed financially and emotionally by friday_'s heartstopping 190-point_drop in the dow_jones industrial_average and yesterday 's 88-point rebound , they_'re wondering if an individual has any business being in the market . the answer , say_0 academic researchers , money_managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock_market as an_investor . but , they say_0 , people should n't try_to be traders , who buy and sell in an_effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock . the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling . `` if_you look_at 75 years worth of investment history --_including the great_depression and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything 0 an individual could have owned_by a long shot , ''_says barry berlin , vice_president at first wachovia capital_management . a dollar invested in the stock_market in 1926 would_have grown to $ 473.29 by the end of last_june , according_to laurence siegel , managing_director at ibbotson associates inc . but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would_have grown to only $ 16.56 , and a dollar put in treasury_bills would equal a meager $ 9.29 . the longer the time period , the less risk 0 there_is of losing_money in the stock_market . over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio . for_instance , ken gregory , a san_francisco money_manager , calculates that if an_investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index , the chance of losing_money is 3_% to 4_% over a 10-year period , compared_with 15_% over three_years and 30_% over one year . `` if_you do_n't need the money for 10_years , there 's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' mr. gregory says . stock-market investments also help balance the other assets 0 an individual owns , says_0 john blankenship jr. , president of the institute of certified financial_planners . stocks have a place in an investors_' portfolio along_with real_estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he_says 0 . there_are some important caveats : before investing in stocks , individuals should have at_least three to six_months of living expenses set_aside in the bank , most investment_advisers say_0 . individuals also should focus_on building equity in a home , which_provides some protection against inflation , as_well as a nest-egg that can_be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living . people also should n't invest money in stocks that they_'ll need in the near_future -- for_example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . `` you may_have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , ''_says mr. blankenship , a del mar , calif. financial_planner . but once the basics are covered , `` then i would start to invest , even_if it 's as little as $_1,000 , ''_says 0 michael lipper , president of lipper_analytical services_inc . he_says 0 individuals should_consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such_as high-quality bonds . despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that individuals should n't try_to profit from short-term developments . `` it 's very_difficult 0 to do , ''_says donald holt , a market_strategist for wedbush morgan securities , a los_angeles brokerage_firm . `` our markets move so fast and they_are so volatile , 0 there 's no_way 0 the average investor can compete_with the pros . '' individual_investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market . the cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2_% of the order 's value is an_average , says_0 stephen_boesel , manager of t._rowe price 's growth and income mutual_fund . and assuming 0 their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains . that can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , mr. lipper says_0 . after that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment 0 they choose wo_n't perform well -- so their trading costs could_be sustained for nothing . `` it 's very tough for most individuals to out-trade the mutual_funds or the market , ''_says mr. lipper . `` you should really think twice if_you think_0 you_can out-smart the system . '' then , too , many individual_investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup 0 professionals say_0 is needed to plunge in and out of the market . so what 's the best_way 0 to buy stocks ? `` unless an individual has a minimum of between $_50,000 and $_100,000 0 to invest in stocks , he 's still better_off in mutual_funds than in individual_stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker , ''_says mr. lipper . still , he_adds 0 , ``_i could see owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based_on their_own insights , '' he_adds . george douglas , first vice_president at drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , says that individuals have a particular edge now in `` small to medium-size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional stomping ground for small_investors . this growth sector , which usually carries a price\/earnings multiple about twice that of the standard_& poor_'s 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right_now . `` it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , ''_says mr. douglas . moreover , mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth_stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term . many big wall_street brokerage_firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging_growth companies a few_years ago are now resuming coverage of this area , he notes 0 . ``_we 're_seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth_stocks , '' he_says . the pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away_from the latest investment fad . they say_0 that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull_market to bail investors out of their mistakes . friday_'s correction presents `` a pretty_good buying_opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , ''_says 0 carmine grigoli , chief equity portfolio strategist_at first_boston corp . `` buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , '' he_says . in the long_run , investment_advisers say_0 , most investors will_be better_off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks . in this method , a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock_market whether the market is up or down . that cuts the risk , mr. gregory , the san_francisco money_manager , points out . `` when the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you_'re buying fewer shares , '' he_says . otherwise , if_you put all your money in at one time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait three_years to get even , mr. gregory says_0 . a disciplined program will work the best , mr. boesel says_0 . `` one of the hardest things 0 to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , '' he_says . `` but that 's just the time when_you should_be buying them .
