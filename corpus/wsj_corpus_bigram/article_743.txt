bankamerica_corp. reported a 34_% jump in third-quarter_earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several_years ago continued to be fueled_by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan_losses . for the quarter , bankamerica said_0 it earned_$ 254 million , or $ 1.16 a_share , compared_with $ 190_million , or 97 cents_a share , a year_earlier . bankamerica spokesmen said_0 preliminary reports indicate 0 the company was n't materially affected_by the tuesday earthquake . all but eight of the 850 branches , which had some structural_damage , reopened yesterday for business . automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday , a bank spokesman_said 0 . for the first_time in nearly two_years , bankamerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters , but the decline from the second_quarter was attributable to special factors . third-quarter_profit was 16_% below the $ 304 million , or $_1.50 a_share , earned in the 1989 second_quarter . the company cited higher tax_credits in the second_quarter , totaling_$ 63 million , compared_with $ 28 million in the third_quarter . excluding tax_credits , profit was 6_% below the second_quarter . but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid , to $_5 million from $ 54_million the second_quarter . moreover , bankamerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $_170 million , about the same as the previous_quarter but well_above the $_100 million in the year-earlier_quarter . the provision rate was far above bankamerica 's actual net credit losses of $ 24 million in the third_quarter , compared_with $ 18 million in the second period and $ 38 million a year_earlier . as a result , bankamerica said_0 its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans , once below 25_% , now amounts to 45_% of the $ 6.4 billion of non-trade debt 0 it calculates 0 it is owed by those nations . that level is about the same as some other big banks , but far_below the 85_% and 100 % reserves of bankers_trust new_york corp. and j.p._morgan &_co. , respectively . by any measure , third-quarter_earnings were still robust , equivalent to a 0.92 % return on assets even excluding tax_credits . by that key measure of operating efficiency , bankamerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded los_angeles-based competitor , security_pacific corp. , which posted a 0.89 % return in the third_quarter . but it continued to badly trail its san_francisco neighbor , wells_fargo &_co. , which reported an_extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets . both returns do_n't include any tax_credits . `` they -lcb- bankamerica -rcb- continue to show good performance , '' said donald k. crowley , an_analyst with keefe , bruyette & woods inc. , san_francisco . in composite_trading yesterday on the new_york stock_exchange , bankamerica common_stock edged_up 12.5_cents to close_at $_32 a_share . shareholder equity improved to 4.68 % from 4.23 % in the previous_quarter . the 4.52 % net interest margin , or the difference_between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate 0 it pays for deposits and other borrowings , was still markedly higher_than the 3.91 % ratio a year_earlier , and is among the best in the industry , analysts said_0 . the high margin partly stems_from continued strong_growth in high-yielding consumer loans , which jumped 31 % to $ 17.47 billion from a year_earlier , and residential mortgages , which rose 25_% to $ 12 billion . bankamerica 's total loans rose 8_% to $ 71.36 billion . for the nine_months , bankamerica profit soared 81 % to $ 833 million , or $ 4.07 a_share , from $ 461 million , or $ 2.40 a_share .
