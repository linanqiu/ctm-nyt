new_york financier saul steinberg sought federal permission to buy more_than 15_% of united_airlines ' parent , ual_corp. , saying_0 he might seek_control of the nation_'s second-largest airline . although takeover experts said_0 they doubted 0 mr._steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his reliance group holdings_inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management_bid . such an application for federal_antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek_control . but some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold . takeover_stock traders were puzzled by the reliance filing and cautioned that it_does n't_mean 0 mr._steinberg will definitely seek_control . `` maybe he just wants to make something happen , '' said one takeover expert . one investment_banker said_0 mr._steinberg may_be trying_to position himself as a friendly investor who could help ual chairman_stephen wolf revive a failed labor-management_bid . mr._steinberg , he suggested 0 , could replace british_airways plc , which has withdrawn from the buy-out_group . reliance had already bought and sold ual_stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse oct._13 of the $_6.79 billion , $_300-a-share labor-management_buy-out . reliance acquired a 7_% ual stake early this_year at an_average cost of $_110 a_share , and reduced its stake to 4.7_% after ual accepted the bid at prices higher_than $ 282 a_share . market sources_said 0 reliance has already sold its entire ual stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock . but the exact amount of reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed . the filing adds a new twist to market speculation_that coniston_partners , a new_york money_manager , has bought more_than 5_% of ual_stock and may challenge the ual_board 's decision last_week to remain_independent . speculation about coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $_145 . ual 's announcement came_after the market closed_yesterday . in composite new_york stock_exchange trading , the shares_closed at $ 177 , up $_1.50 . ual would n't_elaborate on a statement that it had_been notified of the filing by reliance . reliance confirmed the filing but would n't_elaborate . some takeover experts were skeptical , saying_0 it was possible that mr._steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining reliance stake_in ual . mr._steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with ual 's mr._wolf . the investor was instrumental in tapping mr._wolf to run the air cargo unit of tiger international inc . mr._wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with ual in december 1987 . but any potential acquirer must attempt_to reach some_kind of accord with the company 's employees , primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists_' union , which has opposed a takeover .
