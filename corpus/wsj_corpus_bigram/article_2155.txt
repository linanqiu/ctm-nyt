richard_breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone_lines and one phone . it was , after all , only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange_commission . but the lack_of lines became painfully apparent . as the stock_market lurched into a 190-point free_fall on_oct. 13 , mr._breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the sec -- from his_desk , where the new_york stock_exchange was on an open line , to his assistant 's office , where the commodity_futures trading commission was connected , to a third room , where a computer monitored market moves . with other anxious calls pouring in , he recalls , ``_i 'd either have to disconnect the new_york stock_exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk . '' it wo_n't happen again . now there_are more lines connected to the chairman 's office , and the market-monitoring computer has_been moved next to his_desk . it 's all part_of a new `` command center . '' the changes in the office layout illustrate mr._breeden 's stance as the nation_'s top securities regulator . like his predecessor , david ruder , he was faced_with a crisis in the stock_markets soon_after coming into office . but unlike mr. ruder , who during the 1987_crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might_be closed , mr._breeden is turning the market drop to his_own advantage , using it to further his agenda for the sec . in an_interview and in congressional testimony , he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point_plunge in the dow_jones industrial_average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability_to better monitor leveraged_buy-out loan activity by brokerage_firms and to track big trades in the market . a veteran of another financial_crisis , the savings-and-loan_bailout , mr._breeden wants to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls . more broadly , he_wants to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment_banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market . he_believes 0 the tax_code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged_buy-outs , an area 0 the sec does_n't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on_wall street and in congress . also unlike mr. ruder , mr._breeden appears to be in a position 0 to get somewhere with his agenda . as a former white_house aide who_worked closely with congress , he is savvy in the ways of washington . what 's more , the coming_months likely will offer him the opportunity to_obtain his_own majority on the five-member commission , enabling him to_avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor . but mr._breeden , a 39-year-old securities lawyer , has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial_markets . for_instance , he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk , high-yield_junk bonds , an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk_market spills over into stocks . he may_be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk_market liquidity and disclosure rules . he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under_consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission , a job vacant since the summer . mr._breeden 's selection will_be scrutinized as an_important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's high-profile pursuit of insider_trading and market manipulation on_wall street . congress seems likely_to let the new chairman have his way for a while . members of the senate_banking committee know mr._breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill , and the relationship generally remains warm . indeed , during mr._breeden 's confirmation hearing last_month , senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job . these_days , mr._breeden is winning praise in washington and on_wall street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market_plunge and the following monday 's harrowing morning session . as a regulator charged_with restoring investor_confidence , mr._breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to wall_street and to other government_agencies . not_everyone has jumped on the breeden bandwagon , however . some in washington contend_that it 's too_soon to tell whether mr._breeden will_help or hinder the sec . ``_i do_n't think_0 this was a real test , ''_says one congressional aide . `` it was a fairly stressful weekend , but my sense is 0 if_you had n't had richard_breeden there , it would n't have made much of a difference . '' for some at the sec , an agency that covets its independence , mr._breeden may_be too_much of a washington insider . they note that he has adorned his office with five photos of george_bush , one of them featuring the first dog , millie . they worry_that mr._breeden also will roll over when told to do_so by the white_house . but mr._breeden already_has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way . during the monday market rebound , a new_york exchange spokesman told cable_news network viewers that the industrial_average had turned_down 70 points . stunned , mr._breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer , which by then was next to his_desk . it showed the djia up 30 points . sec staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service , quotron , had miscalculated the industrial_average . mr._breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number . `` it was the plunge that did_n't happen , '' he_says . mr._breeden also is trying_to use a far_more catastrophic event -- the california_earthquake -- to move another rule change past congress . that disaster closed the pacific stock_exchange 's stock options-trading operation , forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily . though obscure to most investors , the question of whether to list options on more_than one exchange has aroused much interest in congress , mainly_because regional exchanges fear 0 the change could bankrupt them . congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing . mr._breeden , not missing a chance to press his agenda , cited the earthquake . that event , he contended 0 , simply shows the `` vulnerability '' of having listings on only one exchange .
