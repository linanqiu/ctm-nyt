if_you 'd really rather have a buick , do_n't leave home without the american_express card . or so the slogan might go . american_express co. and general_motors corp. 's beleaguered buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed_at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american_express card . the companies are giving four-day vacations for two to buick buyers who charge all or part_of their down payments on the american_express green card . they have_begun sending letters explaining the program , which began oct._18 and will end dec. 18 , to about five million card_holders . neither company would disclose the program 's cost . buick approached american_express about a joint promotion because its card_holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , ''_says a spokeswoman for the division . american_express also represents the upscale image 0 ``_we 're trying_to project , '' she adds . buick has_been seeking for the past_few years to restore its reputation_as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals . sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared_with a year_earlier , though industry sales fell . but since the 1990_model year began oct._1 , buick sales have plunged 33_% . for american_express , the promotion is part_of an_effort to broaden the use of its card for retail_sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business . traditionally , the card has_been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses . phillip riese , an american_express executive_vice president , says_0 the promotion with buick is his company 's first with an auto_maker , but `` hopefully -lcb- will_be -rcb- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to_promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . '' to that end , american_express has_been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card . many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american_express card , but few card_holders realize this , mr. riese says_0 . until_now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part_of a car purchase through general_motors acceptance_corp. could_n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the gm finance arm . but gmac approved the buick program , he_says 0 , because the american_express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does_n't carry any finance rates . mr. riese says_0 american_express considers gm and buick `` very sophisticated direct-mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . '' in_addition , buick is a relatively respected nameplate among american_express card_holders , says_0 an american_express spokeswoman . when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information_about for possible future purchases , buick came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top_10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says_0 . american_express has more_than 24 million card_holders in the u.s. , and over half have the green card . gmac screened the card-member list for holders more_than 30_years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the buick spokeswoman says_0 . some 3.8_million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with gmac . these 3.8_million people also are eligible to get one percentage_point off gmac 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9_% for two-year loan contracts . a spokesman for visa international 's u.s. subsidiary says_0 his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does_n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the american express-buick link . three divisions at american_express are working with buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible_for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division . the vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some_cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals . destinations are chicago ; honolulu ; las_vegas , nev. ; los_angeles ; miami beach , fla. ; new_orleans ; new_york ; orlando , fla. ; san_francisco ; and washington , d.c. a buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must_pay for his_own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if_they fly on united_airlines . in lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder . card_holders who receive the letter also are eligible_for a sweepstakes with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes . if_they test-drive a buick , they get an american_express calculator . this is n't buick 's first travel-related promotion . a few_years ago , the company offered two round-trip tickets on trans_world airlines to buyers of its riviera luxury_car . the promotion helped riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more_than 10_% , buick said_0 at the time .
