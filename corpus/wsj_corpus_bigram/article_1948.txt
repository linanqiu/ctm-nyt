wanted : an investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about . with $_150 billion of cds maturing this_month , a_lot of people have_been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment . in april , when many of them bought their cds , six-month certificates were yielding more_than 9_% ; investors willing_to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts . now , the nationwide average_yield on a six-month cd is just under 8_% , and 8.5_% is about the best around . but investors looking_for alternatives are n't finding it easy . yields_on most fixed-income securities are lower_than several_months ago . and the stock_market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there . `` if_you 're_looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd , you_'re not_going to find it , ''_says washington financial_planner dennis m. gurtz . there_are , however , some alternatives that income-oriented investors should_consider , investment_advisers say_0 . short-term municipal_bonds , bond_funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices 0 they mention -- and not just as a way_0 to get a higher return . in particular , advisers_say 0 , investors may want to look_at securities that reduce the risk that cd holders are confronting right_now , of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates . a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense . `` people should remember 0 their money is n't all or nothing -- they do_n't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it , ''_says bethesda , md. , adviser karen schaeffer . here 's a look_at some of the alternatives : short-term municipals : investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators . yields_on municipal_bonds can_be higher_than after-tax yields_on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five_years . that 's because municipal-bond interest is exempt_from federal income_tax -- and from state and local taxes too , for in-state investors . for an_investor paying tax at a 33_% rate , a seemingly puny 6_% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9_% . rates approach 6.5_% on five-year municipals . some of the more cautious cd holders might like `` pre-refunded '' municipals . these securities get top credit_ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will_be sold to pay_off holders when the municipals are retired . `` it 's a no-brainer : you_do n't have to worry_about diversification ; you_do n't have to worry_about quality , ''_says steven j. hueglin , executive_vice president of the new_york bond firm of gabriele , hueglin & cashman inc . consider a `` laddered '' bond portfolio , with issues maturing in , say , 1992 , 1993 and 1994 , advises 0 malcolm a. makin , a westerly , r.i. , financial_planner . the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest_rates . bond_funds : bond mutual_funds offer diversification and are easy 0 to buy and sell . that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest_rates will decline over the next_year or so . buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if_they are right . but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest_rates rise instead . bond resale prices , and thus fund share prices , move in the opposite direction from rates . the price_movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens . consider , for_instance , two bond_funds from vanguard_group of investment cos. that were both yielding 8.6 % on a recent day . the short_term bond fund , with an_average maturity of 2_1\/2 years , would deliver a total_return for one year of about 10.6 % if rates drop one percentage_point and a one-year return of about 6.6 % if rates rise by the same_amount . but , in the same circumstances , the returns would_be a more extreme 14.6 % and 2.6_% for the vanguard bond_market fund , with its 12 1\/2-year average_maturity . `` you_get equity-like returns '' from bonds if_you guess right on rates , says_0 james_e. wilson , a columbia , s.c. , planner . if interest_rates do_n't change , bond fund investors_' returns will_be about equal to the funds ' current yields . deferred annuities : these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax_benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual_retirement accounts : investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a 10_% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1\/2 . aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called cd-type annuities , or certificates of annuity . an interest_rate is guaranteed for between one and seven_years , after which holders get 30_days 0 to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities . some current rates exceed those on cds . for_instance , a cd-type annuity from north_american co. for life & health_insurance , chicago , offers 8.8_% interest for one year or a 9_% rate for two_years . annuities are rarely a good_idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions . but at age 55 , `` they may_be a great_deal , ''_says 0 mr. wilson , the columbia , s.c. , planner . money market funds : that 's right , money market mutual_funds . the conventional_wisdom is to go_into money_funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such_as the present , when rates seem headed down . with average maturities of a month or so , money_funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest_rates , with a slight lag . still , today 's highest-yielding money_funds may beat cds over the next_year even_if rates fall , says_0 guy witman , an editor of the bond_market advisor newsletter in atlanta . that 's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1_1\/2 percentage_points above the average cd yield . mr. witman likes the dreyfus worldwide dollar money market fund , with a seven-day_compound yield just under 9.5_% . a new fund , its operating_expenses are_being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor . try combining a money_fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates , suggests 0 back bay advisors inc. , a mutual_fund unit of new_england insurance co . if rates unexpectedly rise , the increasing return on the money_fund will partly_offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund .
