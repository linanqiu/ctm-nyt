when the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s , akzo nv fell out of bed . towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted_for half of the dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge_losses and left akzo 's survival in doubt . it was n't until the early_1980s that akzo nursed itself back to health . now , as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms , akzo says_0 it is in far better shape 0 to cope . investment analysts generally agree . aside_from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders -lrb- $ 1.88 billion -rrb- on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance . during the same_period , the company has sold about 1.6_billion guilders of assets . the fibers business , whose products go_into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20_% of akzo 's sales . ``_we have definitely become less cyclical , '' syb bergsma , executive_vice president-finance , said in an_interview . still , akzo has n't_yet found a way_0 to achieve another goal : a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription_drugs . mr._bergsma said_0 prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too_high , making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area . but he said_0 akzo is_considering `` alliances '' with american drug companies , although he would n't_elaborate . an_indication of akzo 's success in reshaping itself will come thursday when it reports third-quarter_results . analysts_expect the company to show profit of about 225_million guilders , up 9_% from 206.3 million guilders a year_earlier . a bigger test will come next_year if , as many analysts_expect , bulk chemical prices slump in europe . `` maybe akzo can surprise the investment world a_bit , '' said jaap visker , an_analyst at amsterdam-rotterdam bank nv . he figures 0 akzo is_likely to be one of the few major chemical companies 0 to show profit growth next_year . the bank projects 0 akzo will show per-share_earnings of 24 guilders in 1990 , up from an_estimated 22.5 guilders for this_year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988 . at james_capel &_co. in london , analyst jackie ashurst notes that akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products . for_example , akzo has only_minor petrochemical operations , is small in plastics and does_n't make fertilizers . thus , while akzo profited less_than many rivals from the boom of recent_years in petrochemicals and plastics , it has less 0 to fear from the current slump . the company is exposed to bulk chemicals , however . although bulk-chemical prices have_begun falling in the u.s. , they_are generally stable in europe , mr._bergsma said_0 . a decline may come in the first_half of 1990 , he said_0 , but the market does_n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn . to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , akzo has invested heavily in specialty_chemicals , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend_to produce much higher profit_margins than do bulk chemicals . akzo 's_biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of stauffer chemical_co. 's specialty chemical business for $ 625 million . in a less glamorous field , akzo is the world 's_biggest producer of industrial salt , used as a raw_material for the chemical industry as_well as for such tasks as melting ice . akzo also makes products derived from salt , such_as chlorine and caustic soda . in the fibers division , profit remains weak , largely_because of persistent overcapacity . but akzo is still slimming down : it recently_announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the netherlands and west_germany . although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses , such carbon fibers and aramid , extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests . akzo 's twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to du_pont co. 's kevlar , which dominates the market . mr._bergsma said_0 world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are_expected to total about $_500 million this_year . sales_growth of 10_% a year seems possible , he said_0 , and akzo expects its twaron business to become profitable in 1990 . akzo also has spent heavily_on acquisitions in paints , auto finishes and industrial coatings . in_august , for_example , it completed the $_110 million acquisition of reliance universal inc. , a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood , metals and plastics , from tyler corp . mr._bergsma said_0 akzo is_likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale . for akzo 's drug business , where profits have_shown litle change for the past_five years , mr._bergsma predicted moderate profit growth . akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the u.s. and japan . mr._bergsma said_0 akzo hopes to have approval to sell its marvelon pill in the u.s. in 1992 . akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic drugs and veterinary products . veterinary products are showing especially strong_growth , mr._bergsma said_0 . among the leading products is a flu shot for horses .
