new_york times co. 's third-quarter_earnings report is reinforcing analysts_' belief_that newspaper publishers will_be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through 1990 . the publisher was able_to register soaring quarter net_income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-tv system . however , operating_profit fell 35_% to $ 16.4 million . the decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines , lower earnings from the forest-products group , and what is proving to be a nagging major problem , continued declines in advertising linage at the new_york times , the company 's flagship daily newspaper . in composite_trading on the american_stock exchange , new_york times closed_at $ 28.125 a_share , down_37.5 cents . analysts said_0 the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry . retail advertising , which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily_newspapers , largely is n't rebounding in the second_half from extended doldrums as expected . at the same_time , newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising , especially in its financial component . dow_jones &_co. recently reported 0 net_fell 9.9_% , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at the wall_street journal and barron_'s magazine . ``_we expect next_year to be a fairly soft year in newspaper-industry advertising , '' said john morton , an_analyst for lynch , jones & ryan . `` next_year , earnings will hold steady , but we just do_n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising . '' john s. reidy , an_analyst for drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , said , `` the times faces the same problem of other publishers : linage is down . it will_be hard to do handstands until real linage starts heading back up . '' in the quarterly report , arthur ochs sulzberger , new_york times co. chairman and chief_executive officer , said_0 negative factors affecting third-quarter_earnings will_continue . analysts agreed with company expectations that operating_profit will_be down this_year and in 1990 . mr. sulzberger said_0 the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in edison , n.j. , in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs . `` with the edison plant coming on line next_summer , the times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future , '' said peter appert , an_analyst with c.j. lawrence , morgan_grenfell . `` but many newspapers are facing similar comparisons . '' the sale of the company 's cable franchise brought an_after-tax gain of $ 193.3 million , part_of which will_be used to reduce debt . the company also has a stock-repurchase plan . analysts said_0 they_were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group , which consists of the times , 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the international herald tribune ; group operating_profit for the quarter increased slightly to $ 34.9 million from $ 34.5 million on flat revenue . drexel_burnham 's mr. reidy pointed_out that `` profits held up in a tough revenue environment . that 's a good sign when profits are stable during a time 0 revenue is in the trough .
