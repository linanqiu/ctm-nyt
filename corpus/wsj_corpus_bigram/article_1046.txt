usx corp. posted a 23_% drop in third-quarter_profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural_gas operations . the nation_'s largest_steelmaker earned_$ 175 million , or 62_cents a_share , compared_with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80_cents a_share . the recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset_sales , while like gains in the year-earlier_quarter totaled_$ 61 million . in the 1988_period , usx also had a $_71 million_after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement . sales_rose 5_% to $ 4.4 billion from $_4.2 billion . the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last_year 's unusually strong third_quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing . however , third-quarter operating_profit fell 14_% , as usx sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations . among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer_from soft demand_for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets . peter marcus , an_analyst with painewebber_inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled_with sluggish automotive sales , hurt usx results . moreover , usx exports more_than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has_been under more severe pricing pressure . the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the lorain , ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint_venture with japan 's kobe_steel ltd . in the steel division , operating_profit dropped 11_% to $ 85_million . profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last_year and $ 53 a ton in the second_quarter , analysts said_0 . still , usx fared better_than other major_steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either bethlehem_steel corp. , which posted a 54_% drop in net_income , or inland steel industries_inc. , whose profit plummeted 70_% . in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading yesterday , usx shares_closed up $_1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported_earnings exceeded projections by some_analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset_sales . the rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact_that usx 's steel segment fared better_than some other steelmakers ' . charles bradford , an_analyst with merrill_lynch capital_markets , said_0 usx may_have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier_this year . he said_0 usx also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such_as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods . the energy segment , with a 15_% rise in operating_profit , is clearly the company 's strongest . higher crude_oil prices helped boost operating_profit for the marathon oil co._unit to $ 198 million from $ 180_million . the texas oil & gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million . usx announced in october that it was soliciting bids to sell txo 's oil and gas reserves . proceeds of that sale are to be_used to reduce debt and buy_back shares . the company noted_that it has reduced debt by $_1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought_back about 15.5 million_shares of common_stock since the fourth_quarter of 1987 . usx has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term_debt and 257 million_shares outstanding . the announced sale of the reserves was followed_by news that investor carl_icahn had increased his stake_in usx to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination . mr._icahn has said_0 he_believes 0 usx would_be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments . profit for the nine_months jumped 21_% to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a_share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a_share . sales_rose 10_% to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .
