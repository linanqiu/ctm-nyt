wall_street continued to buckle under the public outcry against computer-driven_program trading . kidder , peabody_& co. , a unit of general_electric co. , announced 0 it would stop doing stock-index_arbitrage for its_own account , and merrill_lynch &_co. pulled_out of the practice altogether . at the new_york stock_exchange , which has_been buffeted by complaints from angry individual_investors and the exchange 's own listed companies , chairman_john j._phelan jr. held an_emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the big_board 's 49 stock specialist_firms . the specialists , a trader said_0 , were `` livid '' about mr._phelan 's recent remarks that sophisticated computer-driven trading_strategies are `` here to stay . '' many investors blame program_trading for wild_swings in the stock_market , including the 190-point_plunge in the dow_jones industrial_average on_oct. 13 . a specialist is an exchange member designated to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock . mr._phelan 's meeting with the floor_brokers comes as he prepares to explain the exchange 's position on program_trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow , according_to exchange officials . a big_board spokesman would only say , ``_we 're working the problem and looking_at the issue and meeting with a broad number_of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue . '' the program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant contel corp. said_0 it and 20 or more of the big_board 's listed companies are forming an_unprecedented alliance to complain_about the exchange 's role in program_trading . the decision by merrill , the nation_'s largest securities_firm , represents the biggest retreat yet from program_trading . merrill has_been the fourth-biggest stock-index_arbitrage trader on the big_board this_year , executing an_average of 18.1 million_shares a month in such trades , or about one million_shares a day . merrill 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent_days , because the big securities_firm will no_longer execute stock-index_arbitrage trades for customers . most wall_street firms , in pulling back , have merely stopped such trading for their_own accounts . merrill has_been one of the main firms executing index_arbitrage for customers . merrill also said_0 it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program_trading , including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits_on price moves for program-driven financial futures . merrill , in a statement by chairman william a. schreyer and president daniel p. tully , said_0 index_arbitrage `` has_been clearly identified in the investing public 's mind as a contributing factor to excess market_volatility , '' so merrill wo_n't execute such trades until `` effective controls '' are in place . in stock-index_arbitrage , traders buy and sell large_amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index_futures and options . the idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets . last_thursday , painewebber_group inc. also said_0 it would cease index_arbitrage altogether , but the firm was n't as big an index arbitrager as merrill is . other large firms , including bear , stearns_& co. and morgan_stanley &_co. , last_week announced a pullback from index_arbitrage , but only for the firms ' own_accounts . kidder made an abrupt about-face on program_trading yesterday , after a special_meeting between the firm 's president and chief_executive officer , michael carpenter , and its senior managers . just a week ago , mr._carpenter staunchly defended index_arbitrage at kidder , the most_active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock_exchange this_year . index_arbitrage , mr._carpenter said_0 last_week , does_n't have a `` negative impact_on the market as a whole '' and kidder 's customers were `` sophisticated '' enough to know that . but yesterday , mr._carpenter said_0 big_institutional investors , which he would n't_identify , `` told us 0 they would n't do business with firms '' that continued to do index_arbitrage for their_own accounts . ``_we were following the trend of our competitors who were under_pressure from institutions , '' he said . kidder so_far this_year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million_shares in index-arbitrage trading , and is second only to morgan_stanley in overall program_trading , which_includes index_arbitrage . most of kidder 's program_trading is for its_own account , according_to the new_york stock_exchange . kidder denied that ge 's chairman and chief_executive , john_f. welch , had anything 0 to do with kidder 's decision . but at_least one chief_executive said_0 he called mr. welch to complain_about kidder 's aggressive use of program_trading , and other market sources_said 0 they understood that mr. welch received many phone_calls complaining_about kidder 's reliance_on index_arbitrage as a major business . kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that ge makes decisions for its kidder unit . `` our decision had nothing 0 to do with any pressure 0 mr. welch received , '' mr._carpenter said . `` this was a kidder_peabody stand-alone decision . '' a spokeswoman for ge in fairfield , conn. , said , `` absolutely no_one spoke to jack welch on this subject '' and added , `` anyone_who claims 0 they talked to jack welch is n't telling the truth . '' supporters of index_arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy , as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987 . but merrill_lynch , in its statement about pulling out of index_arbitrage , suggested_that the current debate has missed the mark . merrill said_0 it continues to believe_that `` the causes of excess market_volatility are far_more complex than any particular computer trading strategy . indeed , there_are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such_as pension_funds that involve program_trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries . '' merrill 's index arbitragers will_continue to do other kinds_of computer-assisted program_trading , so there probably_wo n't be any layoffs at the firm , people_familiar with merrill 's program operation said_0 . meanwhile , bear_stearns chairman and chief_executive alan c. greenberg said_0 his firm will_continue stock-index_arbitrage for its clients . at the firm 's annual_meeting last_night , he told shareholders that index_arbitrage wo_n't go away , despite the public outcry . `` if_they think_0 they_are going_to stop index_arbitrage by causing a few wall_street firms to quit , they_are crazy , '' mr._greenberg said . `` it 's not_going to stop it at all . '' mr._greenberg , noting_that stock-index_arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock_market 's volatility , said that for the first four_months of the firm 's fiscal_year beginning in july , stock-index_arbitrage had_been a `` break-even '' proposition for bear_stearns . in response to a shareholder 's suggestion , mr._greenberg agreed that european firms will simply pick_up the index-arbitrage business left_behind by u.s. institutions . pressure_from big_institutional investors has_been the major catalyst for wall_street 's program-trading pullback . and there was speculation yesterday that fidelity_investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of kemper corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities_firms that do program_trading . a fidelity spokesman in boston denied the speculation , saying_0 the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem . but a much_smaller mutual_fund company , the usaa investment_management co._unit of usaa , san_antonio , texas , said_0 it informed nine national brokerage_firms 0 it will cease business with them unless_they stop index-arbitrage trading . usaa , with 400,000 mutual_fund accounts , manages more_than $ 10 billion , $_2 billion of which is in the stock_market . michael j.c. roth , usaa executive_vice president , called program_trading `` mindless . '' he said_0 there_is `` no valid investment reason '' 0 for stock-index_futures to exist . a program-bashing move is clearly on . charles wohlstetter , chairman of contel , who is helping organize the alliance of big board-listed firms , said_0 he had no time 0 to work yesterday because he received so_many phone_calls , faxes and letters supporting his view that the big_board has_been turned into a `` gambling casino '' by program_traders . ``_we are reaching the moment of truth '' on_wall street , said_0 rep. edward_j. markey -lrb-_d. , mass._-rrb- , chairman of the house_subcommittee on telecommunications and finance . `` -lcb- wall_street -rcb- is beginning to realize -- as shakespeare said -- 0 the trouble is not in our stars , but in ourselves .
