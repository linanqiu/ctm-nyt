wary investors have_been running for the stock_market 's equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold-mining and utility companies . those two_groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new_highs . on friday , when only a dozen common stocks hit 52-week highs on the new_york stock_exchange , five were gold-mining issues , and another four were utilities . on monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new_highs , six were utilities or golds . at first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows . after all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high . utility stocks , on the other_hand , thrive on disinflation , because the fat dividends 0 utilities pay look more_attractive when prices are falling -lrb- or rising slowly -rrb- . but the two_groups have something very_important in common : they_are both havens for scared money , stocks for people_who hate stocks . it 's as if investors , the past_few days , are betting that something is going_to go wrong -- even_if they do_n't know_what . if the stock_market and the economy catch their breath and show that they_'re on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back . indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry . still , a_lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares . `` the primary overriding thing is that people are frightened , ''_says martin sass , a new_york money_manager . `` the aftershocks of oct._13 -lrb- when the dow_jones industrial_average dropped 190_points -rrb- are still reverberating . '' certainly , the oct._13 sell-off did_n't settle any stomachs . beyond that , money_managers and analysts see other problems . inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto_makers are idling plants . takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart . britain_'s unsettled political scene also worries some investors . `` the gyrations in the british_government '' add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock_market , says_0 john hoffman , assistant director of research at smith_barney , harris_upham &_co . `` one of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad . '' `` if the fed does_not come to the rescue and produce lower short-term_interest rates over the next 30_days , the market 's going_to flounder , ''_says larry wachtel , a market analyst_with prudential-bache_securities . with this sort of sentiment common , it 's natural for investors to seek out `` defensive '' investments . utilities are a classic example : even in recessions , people continue to use electric_power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate . such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have_been in favor for some time . but many of these stocks have now become expensive . mr. wachtel points to coca-cola_co. and pepsico_inc. as examples : they_'re selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share_earnings . gold_stocks are n't cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for 20 times earnings or more . even utility stocks are n't all that inexpensive , at an_average of 14 times earnings . but the two_groups represent a further step in defensiveness . if gold_stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times . that 's just what joseph granville expects . ``_we are going_to explode lower , ''_says the flamboyant market seer , who had a huge following a few_years back . `` anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible . you_do n't_want to own anything long except gold_stocks . '' one_reason for his gloom is a weekly tally 0 he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new_highs or lows . last_friday , 96 stocks on the big_board hit new 12-month lows . but by mr. granville 's count , 493 issues were within one_point of such lows . robert stovall , a veteran new_york money_manager and president of stovall\/twenty-first securities , has money in both gold and utility issues . ``_i think_0 we could very_well have -lcb- an economic -rcb- slowdown , beginning very soon if not already , '' he_says . mr. stovall does_n't expect an actual recession . but he does expect `` a muffler dragger '' of an economy , with `` very slow growth , maybe one quarter of no growth at all . '' in such a climate , utility stocks look good to him . he favors fpl group_inc. , florida progress corp. , teco energy inc. , wisconsin energy corp. , and dominion resources inc . the appeal of gold issues , mr. stovall says_0 , is that `` they_'re a counter group . you go_into them because_they move counter to the general market . '' he_adds that gold_stocks had_been down so_long 0 they_were `` ready for a bounce . '' his favorites are american barrick resources corp. , echo bay mines ltd. and coeur d'alene mines corp . nevertheless , mr. stovall emphasizes that `` you_do n't buy -lcb- gold_stocks -rcb- based_on powerful fundamentals . '' in_addition to having high price-earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any . `` the earning power -lcb- of gold mining companies -rcb- is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $ 425 an_ounce , '' he_says . abby cohen , an investment strategist for drexel_burnham lambert , also thinks_0 it makes_sense to have some money in both utilities and gold . `` my outlook is for a decline of about 10_% in corporate_profits '' in 1990 , she_says . but `` a bunch of utilities '' should post profit increases . among utilities , drexel currently favors entergy corp. and general public_utilities corp . as for gold , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has_been lately . among gold_stocks , drexel likes battle mountain gold co. , newmont gold co. and freeport-mcmoran gold co .
