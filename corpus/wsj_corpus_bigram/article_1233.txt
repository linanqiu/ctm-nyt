first , there was a death watch . then exhilaration . spurred_by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip_stocks , the dow_jones industrial_average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of friday_'s 190.58-point_plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 . it was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue_chips , on frenetic new_york stock_exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987_crash . while the advance cheered investors who feared 0 a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program_traders . a troubling sign : declining stocks on the big_board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter_market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of friday_'s late big_board plunge . the nasdaq otc index_closed down 6.31 to 460.98 . meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most_important indicators , the dow_industrials ' sister average , the 20-stock dow_jones transportation average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987_crash . transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline_stocks , ual and amr , which each fell more_than 20_% when they reopened for trading_yesterday after being suspended friday_afternoon . ual , the takeover_stock at the center of friday_'s 190.58-point market_plunge , fell 56 7\/8 to 222 7\/8 on nearly 2.3_million shares . overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said_0 arthur cashin jr. , a veteran painewebber_inc. trader_at the big_board . `` everyone was a little concerned_about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the otc_market to get into plus territory . it 's just a strange feeling . i_do n't_think 0 anyone left the place whistling dixie . '' the rally gave credence , at_least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of big_board chairman_john j._phelan jr. that friday_'s market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . '' but to traders , it looked_like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening_bell . the dow_jones industrial_average opened down 1.64 shortly_after 9:30 . but most of the 30 blue-chip_stocks in the average , including eastman_kodak and general_motors , could_n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell_orders left over from friday_'s late-afternoon rout . at 9:45 , procter_& gamble -- one of the most_important dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2_3\/4 to 117 . the dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet_another big tumble . more stocks opened over the ensuing half_hour , as the 49 big_board specialist_firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy_orders from major_brokerage firms 0 to match the selling flood . then , to make matters worse , computerized sell_programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . there was heavy stock-index_arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index_futures to profit from the price_discrepancies between the two markets . this was a hangover from friday , when standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index futures had closed_at a sharp discount to stocks . the onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program_trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . they_did n't . the dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading . with program_traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away_from the market and watched stocks fall . then at 10:15 the dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster_than the early-morning fall . and this time , it was n't just the program_traders who were responsible . all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily . the program_traders were in there , too , of course . but according_to one_trader , the programmers `` did_n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -lcb- also -rcb- a_lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions . roland m. machold , director of the new_jersey division of investment , which_oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said_0 the `` first thing 0 we did was to double our orders '' yesterday_morning . `` with the market down like this , we_'ll probably take another $ 50_million and put it in '' the market . trading in walt_disney co. particularly caught traders ' eyes . according_to big_board officials , disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could_n't finish trading that day . the stock opened late at 114 1\/2 , down 8_1\/2 . but then it shot upward 7 1\/2 as goldman , sachs_& co. stepped in and bought , traders_said 0 . however , disney specialist robert fagenson said : ``_i would_be surprised if goldman represented 4_% of the opening volume . '' around wall_street , trading desks were relieved that they could at_least play the market yesterday , in contrast to friday_'s gridlock . at donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette inc. , head equity trader dudley eppel said : ``_i think_0 the opening was constructive . it was orderly . we put some orders together . there was n't a_lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... . not like friday where they just took -lcb- the market -rcb- apart . '' still , the market had n't_yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum . but in another dramatic burst , the dow tacked on 42 points in five_minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 . on the big_board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval . grinned griffith peck , a trader in shearson_lehman hutton_inc. 's otc department : ``_i tell_you , 0 this market acts healthy . '' around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of perrier water to cool them off . among big_board specialists , the cry was `` pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher_prices for their shares . `` it was bedlam on the upside , '' said one big_board specialist . but not everybody was making money . the carnage on the chicago_board options_exchange , the nation_'s major options market , was heavy after the trading in s&p_100 stock-index options was_halted friday . many market_makers in the s&p_100 index options contract had bullish positions friday , and when the shutdown came they_were frozen with huge_losses . over the weekend , clearing firms told the chicago market_makers to get_out of their positions at any cost monday_morning . `` they_were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one chicago-based options trader . some traders_said that the closely_watched major market index , whose 20 stocks mimic the dow_industrials , did_n't lead yesterday 's big rally . james gallagher , a partner at specialist fowler & rosenau , said , `` the difference_between today and two_years ago '' -- `` terrible tuesday , '' oct._20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go_into the major market index , spend $_2 million and get the program rally started . this time -lcb- institutions -rcb- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away . then when the market was at a technical level 0 to buy , they came in with a vengeance . '' however , according_to one_analyst , the timing of major market index_futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible tuesday . `` futures were pulling the stock_market higher , '' said donald selkin , head of stock-index_futures research at_prudential-bache securities_inc . although the big_board 's specialist_firms struggled through another highly volatile trading_session , their performance yesterday was better_than during friday_'s late-afternoon chaos , according_to traders and brokers who work with them . specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the friday plunge . but yesterday , even with halts in such major blue-chip_stocks as merck , ``_we expected -lrb- the halts -rrb- and it was n't too bad , '' said_0 donaldson 's mr. eppel , who had_been critical of the specialists ' performance on friday . according_to a big_board official , while many stocks opened late , there_were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- amr , merck and valero energy . merck is one of the most_important stocks in the major market index . no sector of the market has_been spared during the past_two days ' gyrations . yet from the dow_industrials ' high on_oct. 9 through friday_'s plunge , relatively good performances have_been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious_metals and life_insurance stocks . and yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues . for_example , halliburton jumped_3 1\/4 to 38 , schlumberger rose_2 1\/2 to 43 1\/4 and baker hughes rose_1 1\/8 to 22 . because of the ual and amr tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday . philip_morris was the big_board 's most_active issue , rising 2_1\/4 to 43 1\/4 on nearly eight million_shares . among_other major issues , coca-cola_co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7_million shares and american_telephone &_telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million_shares . shares of international_business machines , which reported_earnings yesterday , finished_at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during friday_'s session for the first_time in five_years . shares of three brokerage_firms rose after they reported_earnings . merrill_lynch added_1 3\/4 to 28 , painewebber rose 3\/4 to 18 1\/2 and bear_stearns rose 3\/8 to 14 1\/4 . federal_national mortgage_association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6_million shares . at a news_conference after the close of trading_yesterday , the big_board 's mr._phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel . mr._phelan said that program_trading strategies were n't responsible_for triggering friday_'s decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent_months . some 24 million of the more_than 100_million shares_traded in the final 90 minutes of friday_'s session , when the plunge in stock_prices was concentrated , were program-related , he said_0 . program_trades make up 10_% of the exchange 's volume on an_average day , but despite the increase friday , it was `` certainly_not something 0 you would say_0 precipitated the market decline , '' mr._phelan said_0 . mr._phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday . ``_obviously , every time 0 we get this_kind of reaction , it 's going_to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said . he said that exchange officials had conversations with wall_street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . '' meanwhile , peter dapuzzo , shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional_investors in the otc_market , who were heavy buyers of the nasdaq 's_biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors . `` the institutions ca_n't be criticized for their behavior , '' mr._dapuzzo said in an_interview . `` it was the opposite of what_happened on_oct. 19 . they used their judgment . they_did n't panic during the first round of selling this_morning . instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly . maybe they learned from experience . '' mr._phelan said_0 the performance of specialists during friday_'s plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 big_board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close . `` they_did an excellent job , '' mr._phelan said of the specialists . wall_street traders on friday had complained about the trading suspensions . james_a. white and sonja steptoe contributed_to this_article .
