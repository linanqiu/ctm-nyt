what_happened friday shows that financial_markets are not_yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices . no fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . after the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would_be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . the new_york stock_exchange adopted two specific circuit_breakers : if the dow_jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an_additional two_hours . the rationale is that an interruption of trading will_allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . a temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself . but there_is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . what_happened friday was the worst of all worlds . the futures_exchanges followed their_own pre-set circuit_breakers and shut_down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the standard_& poor_'s 500 stock index had_fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the dow_jones index . options markets stopped trading in many securities . the new_york stock_exchange , under its_own rules , remained open . with nowhere else 0 to go , sellers , and particularly program_traders , focused all their selling on the new_york stock_exchange . as liquidity on that market weakened , prices_fell sharply . had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would_have been provided and the decline , most probably , would_have been less intense . at 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington , the futures_exchanges reopened . futures_trading , however , was_halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures_markets had dropped an_additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . at this point , the options markets also shut_down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new_york stock_exchange . it is time 0 to recognize that the new_york stock_exchange , the futures_markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively . traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit_breakers . to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should_be open to trading or none . synchronized circuit_breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday , but they probably would_have made for smoother , less volatile executions . it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange_commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . let 's not have one market shut_down for 30 minutes when the dow declines 100 points and another shut_down for an_hour after a 250-point decline . the need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit_breakers in all markets . the new circuit_breakers , if_they are to be applied at all , will_require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new_york stock_exchange remains open . the rules should_be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . should the sec and the commodities futures_trading commission -lrb- which , with the sec , regulates the chicago stock-index markets -rrb- be unable_to agree , the issue may_have to be_resolved by decision of the treasury_secretary . in many_ways , our financial_markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they_were two_years ago . the new_york stock_exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . telephone_service has_been improved for customers trying_to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who i_believe 0 should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions . -lrb- of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock_prices . witness the fact_that trading in some stocks_closed early friday and opened late_monday because of an excess of sell_orders . -rrb- but the task of improving market performance remains unfinished . mr. freund , former chief_economist of the new_york stock_exchange , is a professor of economics at pace university 's business school in new_york .
