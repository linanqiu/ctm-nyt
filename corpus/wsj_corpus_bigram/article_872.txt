with airline deals in a tailspin , legendary wall_street trader michael steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of usair_group , traders_say 0 . only a week ago , when airline buy-out fever was already winding down , mr._steinhardt was engaged_in a duel with usair . he was threatening to take_over the carrier , after spending an_estimated $ 167 million to build an 8.4 % usair stake for his investment clients . the would-be raider even hired an investment_banker to give teeth to his takeover_threat , which was widely interpreted as an_effort to flush out an acquirer for usair , or for his_own stake . in fighting usair , mr._steinhardt was pitted against another investor , billionnaire warren buffett , who bought into usair to help fend_off mr._steinhardt . mr. buffett 's firm , berkshire hathaway , holds a much bigger stake_in the carrier than mr._steinhardt 's firm , steinhardt partners . now , in the wake_of ual 's troubles in financing its buy-out , the airline raiding game has_been grounded . instead of hoping to sell his usair stake at analysts_' estimated buy-out price of $ 80 a_share , mr._steinhardt is stuck_with roughly 3.7 million usair shares that cost him $ 45 , on average , but yesterday closed_at 40 1\/2 , up 1\/4 , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . `` it_does n't make_sense to parachute out at this price , '' mr._steinhardt says , though he has stopped his takeover talk and now commends usair managers ' `` operating skills . '' at the current price , the usair holding represents 9_% of all the assets that mr._steinhardt manages . a week ago , usair stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in usa_today that mr._steinhardt might launch a hostile_bid for the carrier , though takeover speculators say_0 they_were skeptical . `` if usair is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52 , the market was saying_0 steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything , in terms of getting a deal done , ''_says a veteran takeover speculator . traders_say 0 this all goes to show that even the smartest money_manager can_get infected with crowd passions . in trying_to raid usair , mr._steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor , and ran_into snags . moreover , unlike mr. buffett , who often holds big stakes in companies for years , mr._steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing . mr._steinhardt , who_runs about $_1.7 billion for steinhardt partners , made his_name as a gunslinging trader , moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients . meanwhile , his big losses , for_instance in 1987 's crash , generally have_been trading losses . so , some see a special irony in the fact_that mr._steinhardt , the trader , now is encumbered with a massive , illiquid airline holding . analysts_say 0 usair stock might lose four or five points if the steinhardt stake was dumped all at once . as a result , mr._steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling usair at a loss , or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment . `` long-term investing -- that 's not steinhardt 's style , '' chuckles an_investor who once worked at steinhardt partners . `` he does_n't usually risk that much unless he_thinks 0 he has an ace in the hole , '' adds another steinhardt partners alumnus . in recent_days , traders_say 0 usair has_been buying its_own shares , as_part of a program to retire about eight million usair shares , though the carrier wo_n't discuss its buy-back_program . if usair stepped_up its share purchases , that might_be a way_0 for mr._steinhardt to get_out , says_0 timothy pettee , a merrill_lynch analyst . but usair might_not want to help mr._steinhardt , he_adds 0 . in 1987 , usair chairman edwin colodny stonewalled when trans_world airlines chairman carl_icahn threatened to take_over the carrier . mr._icahn , a much more practiced raider than mr._steinhardt , eventually sold a big usair stake at a tiny profit through bear , stearns . mr._steinhardt also could take that route . he confers big trading commissions on_wall street_firms . however , with airline_stocks cratering , he might_not get a very_good price for his shares , traders_say 0 . especially galling for mr._steinhardt , say_0 people close to him , is that usair 's mr. colodny wo_n't even take his telephone_calls . while usair is n't considered absolutely takeover-proof , its defenses , including the sale in_august of a 12_% stake_in the company to mr. buffett 's berkshire hathaway , are pretty strong . usair 's deal_with mr. buffett `` was n't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy , '' mr._steinhardt says_0 . since last_april , the investor has made seven so-called 13d filings in usair , as he bought and sold the company 's stock . such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try_to scare a company 's managers , and to stir interest in the stock . but of course it would_be highly unusual for an investment fund such_as steinhardt partners to take_over a company . usair and mr. buffett wo_n't talk_about mr._steinhardt at all . analysts_say 0 usair has great promise . by the second_half of 1990 , usair stock could hit 60 , says_0 helane becker of shearson_lehman hutton . she thinks_0 traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35 . but meanwhile , usair is_expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries_to digest piedmont airlines , which it acquired . moreover , some investors think_0 a recession or renewed airfare wars will pummel airline_stocks in coming_months . however , mr._steinhardt says_0 he 's `` comfortable holding usair as an investment . '' while he has bought and sold some usair shares in recent_days , he_says that contrary to rumors , he has n't tried_to unload his holding . mr._steinhardt adds that he bought usair stock earlier_this year as `` part_of a fundamental investment in the airline group . '' in 1989 , mr._steinhardt says_0 he made money trading in texas_air , amr and ual . overall , his investments so_far this_year are showing gains of about 20_% , he_adds 0 . does mr._steinhardt regret his incursion into the takeover-threat game ? people close to the investor say_0 that was an experiment 0 he is unlikely to repeat . ``_i do_n't think_0 you_'ll find 0 i_'m making a radical change in my traditional investment style , '' mr._steinhardt says .
