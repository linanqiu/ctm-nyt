investor_harold simmons and nl industries_inc. offered to_acquire georgia_gulf corp. for $ 50 a_share , or about $_1.1 billion , stepping_up the pressure_on the commodity_chemicals concern . the offer follows an earlier proposal by nl and mr._simmons to help georgia_gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $_55 a_share . georgia_gulf rebuffed that offer in_september and said_0 it would study other alternatives . however , it has n't_yet made any proposals to shareholders . late_yesterday , georgia_gulf said_0 it reviewed the nl proposal as_well as interests from `` third_parties '' regarding business combinations . georgia_gulf said_0 it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are_being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions . '' it did_n't elaborate . analysts saw the latest offer as proof that mr._simmons , an aggressive and persistent investor , wo_n't leave georgia_gulf alone until some_kind of transaction is completed . `` he has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull , ''_says paul leming , a vice_president with morgan_stanley &_co . `` he appears to be in it for the long_haul . '' mr._simmons and nl already_own a 9.9_% stake_in georgia_gulf . mr._simmons owns 88 % of valhi inc. , which in turn owns two-thirds of nl . nl is officially making the offer . mr. leming was n't surprised by the lower price cited by nl , saying_0 he_believes that $_55 a_share is `` the most 0 you_can pay for georgia_gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition . '' georgia_gulf stock rose $_1.75 a_share yesterday to close_at $ 51.25 a_share , while nl shares_closed unchanged_at $ 22.75 and valhi rose 62.5_cents to $ 15 , all in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . j. landis martin , nl president and chief_executive officer , said_0 nl and mr._simmons cut the price 0 they_were proposing for georgia_gulf because_they initially planned a transaction that included about $_250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated_debt . however , the junk-bond_market has collapsed in recent_weeks , lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed . now , he said_0 , the group plans to put in `` several_hundred million '' dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank_debt . he also said that the group reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see georgia_gulf 's confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had georgia_gulf 's consent . in a letter to georgia_gulf president jerry r. satrum , mr. martin asked georgia_gulf to answer its offer by tuesday . it was n't clear how nl and mr._simmons would respond if georgia_gulf spurns them again . mr. martin said_0 they have n't_yet decided what their next move would_be , but he did_n't rule_out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed_at replacing georgia_gulf 's board . in other transactions , mr._simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender_offer . although georgia_gulf has n't been eager to negotiate with mr._simmons and nl , a specialty_chemicals concern , the group apparently believes_0 the company 's management is interested_in some_kind of transaction . the management group owns_about 18_% of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold . in the third_quarter , georgia_gulf earned_$ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a_share , down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a_share on fewer shares_outstanding . sales fell to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million .
