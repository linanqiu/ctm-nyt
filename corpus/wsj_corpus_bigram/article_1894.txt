retailers in the west and parts of the south are entering the critical christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions . in a new report , the international council of shopping_centers said_0 sales of general_merchandise in the west for the first seven_months of 1989 rose 6.6 % above year-earlier_levels . sales_increased a more modest 4.8_% in the south and 4.4 % in the midwest . but sales in the oil-patch state of texas surged 12.9 % and sales in south_carolina jumped 10.6 % in the period , the new_york trade_group said_0 . in the northeast , however , sales declined 0.4_% in the period , with sales in new_england falling 2.6_% . the numbers show that ``_we do_n't have a monolithic economy , '' said isaac lagnado , council research_director . `` there_are a_lot of have and have-not markets . '' sales nationally rose 3.9_% through july , the latest month for which the figures_are available , the council said_0 . the northern_california earthquake and hurricane_hugo are_likely to temporarily damp sales_growth in the west and south_carolina . but mr. lagnado predicted 0 the regional trends would_continue through christmas . `` the big mo is as_much of a factor in retailing as in politics , '' he said . the christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly_half of their profits . the council 's report is based_on data 0 the trade_group buys from the u.s. census_bureau . the information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such_as sears , roebuck_& co. and k_mart corp. as_well as closely_held concerns such_as r.h._macy &_co . the council plans to release its regional reports monthly . mr. lagnado said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact_on sales_growth . el_paso , austin and fort_worth , the three strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in texas , where employment grew a relatively strong 2_% . massachusetts , which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries , was the weakest link in bleak new_england . the results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past_two years . in 1987 , the west had the slowest sales_growth , and the south and the midwest were first and second respectively , according_to the council . mr. lagnado said that although retailers probably_wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the california quake and hurricane_hugo , they could see some benefits later on . stores such_as sears that sell big-ticket durable_goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said_0 .
