with the dust settling from the failed_coup attempt in panama , one of the many lingering questions 0 the bush_administration will ponder is this : is the national_security council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign_policy ? president_bush 's national_security adviser , lt. gen. brent scowcroft , came into office in january intent on making the nsc_staff leaner and more disciplined than it had_been during the reagan_administration . gen._scowcroft was a member of the tower commission , which investigated the iran-contra affair . he was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised nsc_staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked president_reagan 's second term . so , following both the style 0 he pursued as president ford 's national_security adviser and the recommendations of the tower commission , gen._scowcroft has pruned the nsc_staff and tried_to ensure_that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the state_department , pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making_sure 0 presidential decisions are carried_out . the tower commission specifically said that the nsc_staff should_be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like lt. col. oliver_north strike out on their_own rather_than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the state_department , pentagon or central_intelligence agency . however , the panama episode has raised questions_about whether the nsc_staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues . during the coup_attempt and its aftermath , nsc staffers were `` stretched very thin , ''_says one senior administration official . `` it 's a very small shop . '' gen._scowcroft does_n't plan to increase the staff right_now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds 0 . the nsc_staff `` does_n't have the horsepower that i_believe 0 is required to have an effective interagency process , ''_says frank gaffney , a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy , a conservative washington think-tank . `` the problem with this administration , i_think 0 , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the nsc . '' the national_security council itself was established in 1947 because policy_makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the white_house 0 to make_sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the state_department , pentagon and intelligence agencies . by law , the council includes the president , vice_president and secretaries of state and defense . in practice , the director of central_intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve_as unofficial members . but the size , shape and role of the nsc_staff have_been left for each president and his national_security adviser to decide . that task is one of washington 's perennial problems . in the bush white_house , the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration_officials say_0 . administration_officials insist_that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis . but one clear problem during the coup_attempt was that the nsc staffer most experienced in latin_america , everett briggs , was gone . he had just resigned , at_least in part because of a feud with assistant_secretary of state bernard aronson over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra_rebels . the absence of mr. briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current nsc_staff . both gen._scowcroft and his deputy , robert gates , are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs . gen._scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and mr. gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society . both have become confidants of president_bush . but neither has an extensive background in latin_america , the middle_east or asia . in those areas , the role of nsc staffers under them therefore have become more_important . gen._scowcroft knows as_well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers 0 he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative anonymity will_take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state_department and pentagon bureaus . but just as every previous nsc adviser has , gen._scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the nsc_staff becomes too lean and too restrained .
