the government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross_national product this_week in a report that is_expected to disclose much tamer inflation . the consensus view on real_gnp , the total_value of the nation_'s output of goods and services adjusted_for inflation , calls_for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second_quarter 's 2.5_% , according_to mms international , a unit of mcgraw-hill_inc. , new_york . but inflation , as measured_by the gnp deflator in thursday 's report , is_expected to rise only 3.5_% , down from 4.6_% in the second_quarter . `` inflation could_be a real surprise , '' said samuel d. kahan , chief_financial economist_at kleinwort_benson government securities inc. , in chicago . `` if that gets people excited , it could serve_as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he_added . the week 's other notable indicators include mid-october auto sales , september durable_goods orders as_well as september personal_income , personal consumption and the saving rate . most are_expected to fall_below previous-month levels . many_economists see even slower gnp growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . in_addition to softer production data , weaker housing_starts and lower corporate_profits currently in evidence , some_analysts believe_0 the two recent natural_disasters -- hurricane_hugo and the san_francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth_quarter . the recent one-day , 190-point_drop in the dow_jones industrial_average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment_on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . `` the stock_market is sick because profits are crumbling , ''_says michael k. evans , president of evans economics inc. , washington . the economy , he_noted 0 , moves the market , not vice versa . on the other_hand , mr._evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter gnp . '' his estimate of 3.3_% for third-quarter gnp is higher_than the consensus largely_because he_believes 0 current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate 0 . demand , he_believes 0 , is being met from overhang rather_than new production . by and large , economists believe_0 the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . edward_j. campbell , economist_at brown brothers harriman &_co. , new_york , noted_that large increases in construction activity along_with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . gary ciminero , economist_at fleet\/norstar financial group , providence , r.i. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7_% , well_below the second_quarter 's 4.6_% , partly_because of what he_believes 0 will_be temporarily better price behavior . he_expects real_gnp growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade_deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . sung won sohn , chief_economist at norwest corp. , minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market_volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad_news '' from recent trade_deficit , employment and housing reports . the consensus calls_for a 0.5_% increase in_september personal_income and a 0.3_% gain in consumption . in_august , personal_income rose 0.4_% and personal consumption increased 0.9_% . charles lieberman , managing_director of financial_markets reasearch at manufacturers_hanover securities corp. , new_york , said_0 hurrican hugo shaved 0.1_% to 0.2_% from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism . durable_goods orders for september , due out tomorrow , are_expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared_with august 's 3.9_% increase . as_usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5_% to a gain of 1.6 % .
