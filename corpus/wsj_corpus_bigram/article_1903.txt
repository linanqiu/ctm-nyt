sea_containers ltd. said_0 it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by temple holdings_ltd. , which made an earlier tender_offer for sea_containers . sea_containers , a hamilton , bermuda-based shipping concern , said tuesday that it would sell $_1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50_% of its common_shares for $_70 apiece . the move is designed to ward off a hostile_takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns , stena holding ag and tiphook plc . in may , the two_companies , through their jointly_owned holding_company , temple , offered $ 50 a_share , or $ 777 million , for sea_containers . in_august , temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a_share , or $ 963 million . yesterday , sea_containers ' chief_executive officer , james sherwood , said in an_interview that , under the asset-sale plan , sea_containers would end_up with a cash surplus of approximately_$ 620 million . about $ 490 million of that would_be allocated to the buy-back , leaving about $_130 million , he said_0 . that $_130 million , mr. sherwood said_0 , `` gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid . we are able_to increase our price above the $_70 level if_necessary . '' he declined to say , however , how_much sea_containers might raise its price . mr. sherwood speculated_that the leeway that sea_containers has means that temple would_have to `` substantially increase their bid if_they 're_going to top us . '' temple , however , harshly criticized sea_containers ' plan yesterday , characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer . '' a spokesman for temple estimated that sea_containers ' plan -- if all the asset_sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45 a_share in cash . the lower figures , the spokesman_said 0 , would stem_from preferred_shares being converted to common_stock and the possibility that sea_containers ' subsidiaries might_be required to place their shares in the open_market . temple added that sea_containers is still mired in legal problems in bermuda , where the supreme_court has temporarily barred sea_containers from buying back its_own stock in a case brought by stena and tiphook . -lcb- the court has indicated 0 it will rule on the case by the end of the month . -rcb- temple also said_0 sea_containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did_n't elaborate . mr. sherwood said_0 reaction to sea_containers ' proposal has_been `` very_positive . '' in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading yesterday , sea_containers closed_at $ 62.625 , up_62.5 cents .
