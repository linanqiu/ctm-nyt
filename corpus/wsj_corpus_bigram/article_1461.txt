walter sisulu and the african_national congress came home yesterday . after 26 years in prison , mr._sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . at the same_time , six anc colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their_families at various places around the country . and as the graying men returned to their homes , the anc , outlawed in south_africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships . a huge anc flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at mr._sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts , caps and scarves . at the small four-room home of elias motsoaledi , a leading anc unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , umkhonto we sizwe , well-wishers stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in anc ribbons . ``_i am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said mr._sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit . as the crowd outside his home shouted `` anc , anc , '' the old man shot his fists into the air . ``_i 'm inspired by the mood of the people . '' under the laws of the land , the anc remains an illegal organization , and its_headquarters are still in lusaka , zambia . but the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the anc , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing . `` the government can never put the anc back_into the bottle again , '' said cassim saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome mr._sisulu . `` things have_gone too_far for the government to stop them now . there 's no turning back . '' there was certainly no stopping the tide of anc emotion last_night , when hundreds_of people jammed into the holy cross anglican church in soweto for what became the first anc_rally in the country in 30_years . deafening chants of `` anc '' and `` umkhonto we sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the anc would_continue its fight_against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . and they called on the government to release nelson mandela , the anc 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . without him , said_0 mr._sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' president f.w. de_klerk released the anc men -- along_with one of the founding members of the pan africanist congress , a rival liberation group -- as_part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations_with black leaders over a new constitution aimed_at giving blacks a voice in national government . but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country . as other repressive governments , particularly poland and the soviet_union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . as the days go by , the south_african government will_be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of mr. mandela as_well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency . if it_does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the anc , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . if it_does , the large_number of right-wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step_up their agitation and threats to take matters into their_own hands . the newly released anc leaders also will_be under enormous pressure . the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it_does , pretoria will use this as a reason 0 to_keep mr. mandela behind bars . pretoria has n't forgotten why they_were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . in_addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment . in order to head_off any divisions , mr. mandela , in a meeting with his_colleagues before they_were released , instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in lusaka as_soon as possible . the men also will_be faced_with bridging the generation gap_between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action . says peter mokaba , president of the south_african youth congress : ``_we will_be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc . '' they never considered themselves to be anything_else . at last_night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid . ``_we emphasize discipline because we_know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said andrew mlangeni , another early umkhonto leader who is now 63 . ``_we want to see nelson mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may_not see them here with us .
