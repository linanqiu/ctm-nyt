troubled saatchi_& saatchi co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including interpublic_group , but has rejected them , people_familiar with the company said_0 . industry_executives said_0 interpublic approached saatchi in_august about buying its campbell-mithun-esty unit , but was turned_down by chairman maurice saatchi . more recently , interpublic inquired about one of saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the rowland public_relations firm by several industry_executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said_0 . interpublic 's chairman and chief_executive officer , philip geier jr. , made the pitches in visits to mr. saatchi in london , the executives said_0 . a saatchi spokesman_declined to comment about interpublic . but the spokesman confirmed_that saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested_in acquiring its campbell-mithun and rowland units . he_added , ``_we have no intention of selling either business . '' interpublic declined_comment . the offers come as saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history . takeover_speculation has_been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest_shareholder , southeastern asset_management , has said_0 it 's been approached by third_parties regarding a possible restructuring . analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at_least for the short_term , is bleak . in the midst_of the current turmoil , saatchi is attempting_to shore_up its ad businesses . it named a new chief_executive officer , former ims international head robert louis-dreyfus . it rebuffed an offer by carl spielvogel , head of saatchi 's backer_spielvogel bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part_of saatchi . and last_week , people close to saatchi said_0 maurice saatchi and his brother , charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile_bid emerged . but saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested_in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . while saatchi 's major agency networks -- backer_spielvogel and saatchi_& saatchi advertising -- would_be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive . campbell-mithun-esty , for_example , has had big problems at its new_york office , but offers strong offices in other_areas of the country , including minneapolis and chicago . that would would make it appealing to a network such_as interpublic that already_has a healthy new_york presence . -lrb- while there would_be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with saatchi 's other agencies . -rrb- campbell-mithun also would_be a sizable addition to an agency network : it has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including general_mills , jeep\/eagle and dow brands . rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest u.s. public_relations firm , according_to o'dwyer's directory of public_relations firms . it would_be attractive to an agency such_as interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public_relations firm of its_own . other saatchi units include ad_agency mccaffrey & mccall , which has the mercedes account and which has_been attempting_to buy itself back ; and howard marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . despite saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , u.s. analysts_believe 0 the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . mr. louis-dreyfus , in a recent interview , said_0 he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . '' analysts_believe 0 he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses . prudential 's final four prudential_insurance co. of america said_0 it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $_70 million account . in_addition to backer_spielvogel bates , a saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include lowe marschalk , a unit of the lowe group ; grey advertising ; and wpp_group 's scali , mccabe , sloves agency . all agencies are new_york-based . a spokesman for the insurance and financial_services firm , based in newark , n.j. , said_0 it hopes to make a decision within three to four_months . jamaica fires back the jamaica tourist_board , in the wake_of young_& rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident . the memo attempts_to remove the tourist_board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges . among_other things , the memo contends_that young_& rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of jamaica or the jamaica tourist_board . '' it also contends_that young_& rubicam never told the tourist_board about its relationship_with ad ventures , a jamaican firm hired by the agency . the u.s. indictment charges 0 ad ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism . the memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement thursday that it would no_longer handle the $_5 million to $_6 million account . the agency declined_comment , but said_0 it will_continue work until a new agency is chosen . ad_notes ... . new account : american suzuki motor_corp. , brea , calif. , awarded its estimated $ 10 million to $ 30 million account to asher\/gould , los_angeles . also participating in the finals was los_angeles agency hakuhodo advertising america . american suzuki 's previous agency , keye\/donna\/pearlstein , did_n't participate . ayer talks : n w ayer 's president and chief_executive officer , jerry j. siano , said_0 the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring zwiren collins karo & trusk , a midsized chicago agency , but a deal is n't_yet close to being completed . who 's news : john wells , 47 , former_president and chief_executive of n w ayer 's chicago office , was_named management director and director of account services at wpp_group 's j._walter thompson agency in chicago ... . shelly lazarus , 42 , was_named president and chief_operating officer of ogilvy_& mather direct , the direct_mail division of wpp_group 's ogilvy_& mather agency .
