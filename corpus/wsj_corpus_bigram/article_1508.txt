japan has found another safe outlet for its money : u.s. home mortgages . an increasing number_of big japanese_investors are buying up u.s. home mortgages that have_been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known_as mortgage-backed_securities . as_much as 10_% of new u.s. mortgage_securities issued by the federal_national mortgage_association , or fannie_mae , and federal_home loan_mortgage corp. , or freddie_mac , now flow into japanese hands . that may_not come as a surprise to americans who have watched the japanese snap up properties in the u.s. from golf courses to a stake_in rockefeller_center . but it marks a big change for the japanese , who shunned mortgage_securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest_rates a few_years back . `` you_ca n't say_0 it 's a `` tsunami '' -lrb- tidal wave -rrb- , but we_'re making some headway , ''_says fannie_mae 's chairman , david o. maxwell , who visits tokyo at_least once a year to explain and drum_up investor_interest in mortgage_securities . `` interest is a great_deal higher_than it was a year_ago . '' the steady growth of the mortgage_securities market in the u.s. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here . evidence of the growing japanese demand_for mortgage_securities abounds . earlier_this year , blackstone group , a new_york investment_bank , had no trouble selling out a special $ 570 million mortgage-securities trust 0 it created for japanese_investors . industrial bank of japan , which claims to be the biggest japanese buyer of u.s. mortgage_securities , says_0 it will more_than double its purchases this_year , to an amount 0 one official puts at several billion dollars . and a fannie_mae seminar this_week promises to draw hundreds_of prospective investors , who can_be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next_few years . `` last_year , there_were only several big investors who were interested , ''_says kinji kato , a vice_president at the international arm of nomura_securities co . `` this_year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a_lot . '' ultimately , he_says 0 , strong_demand could help to drive_down interest_rates on mortgage_securities . at the moment , nomura is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fannie_mae instruments . but other japanese institutions say privately that they_are considering asking to join the 59-dealer selling group . these securities are attractive to japanese_investors for three reasons . first , they_are safe . while they_are n't backed_by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government , as treasury_bonds are , it is widely assumed that the government would support them if_necessary . -lrb- u.s. treasury_bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term japanese_investors -rrb- . second , they_are liquid . the secondary_market in federally backed mortgage_securities now exceeds $ 900 billion , or nearly_half of the $_2.2 trillion in u.s. residential mortgages issued . third , they offer high yields . at the moment , some offer as_much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage_points over treasury_securities of similar maturities . but there_is a risk , which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five_years ago . since most mortgages can_be prepaid or refinanced at any time , issuers of mortgage_securities retain the right to buy_back their bonds before maturity . that 's a headache for long-term investors , since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage_securities carried . `` two or three_years ago , the problem was that people did_n't understand the prepayment risk , ''_says nomura 's mr. kato . `` so they_were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment . '' compounding the trouble to japanese_investors , mortgage_securities pay interest monthly , since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments . but japanese institutional_investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments , so the monthly cash_flow posed administrative problems . as a result , japanese_investors steered clear of the mortgage_securities . but they_did n't lose touch with the u.s. issuers . since_1985 , japanese_investors have bought nearly 80_% of $ 10 billion in fannie_mae corporate debt issued to foreigners , money that fannie_mae uses to buy mortgages from u.s. banks . and japanese_investors took up nearly all of two $_200 million real_estate mortgage investment conduits , a kind_of collateralized mortgage obligation , that were offered to foreigners this_year . in_addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed_securities , such_as blackstone 's fund , have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do_n't have to . freddie_mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees 0 it wo_n't be prepaid for a set number_of years and offers semiannual payments .
