missouri farmer blake hurst writing in the fall issue of the heritage foundation 's policy review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county : of course i_'d rather have a computer_software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator . but i_'d also rather live next_door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms 0 i_'ve seen -lrb- and smelt -rrb- in these parts . an incinerator is also probably better_than having nobody next_door -- on our farm there_are four unoccupied houses . on my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning , i drive by another four empty houses . a community of abandoned farmsteads , failing businesses , and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one ... . the loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural missouri is hardly of national importance except_for this : if the most environmentally safe way of dealing_with a national problem can_not be_built in atchinson county , what hope have we for dealing_with the wastes 0 our economy produces ? after all , farmers here work with `` hazardous '' chemicals every_day , many of them the same chemicals that would_have been destroyed in the incinerator . we_know 0 they_are dangerous , but if handled with care , their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment .
