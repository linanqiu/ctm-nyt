one day last_march , cbs_sports president neal pilson and olympics superagent barry frank met for lunch at the lotos club here . mr. frank told mr._pilson that olympics officials wanted $ 290 million or more for tv rights to the 1994 winter_games in norway . the cbs official said_0 that price sounded fine . at that price , cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations_with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug. 23 . dick pound , a committee member , began by disclosing that abc and nbc had refused_to even bid . then , he asked mr._pilson to raise his offer anyway : `` if we_can have a number that starts with a three , you_can have a dea . '' mr._pilson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10_minutes to return with a $_300 million offer . mr. pound responded , `` it 's a deal . '' a beaming mr._pilson announced his lastest coup at a news_conference that afternoon . mr._pilson 's rivals at abc and nbc grimaced at the price . how could cbs get pushed into outbidding itself ? well , cbs , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid . but mr._pilson has_been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had_hoped to_avoid . `` the price of poker has gone up , '' crows charles m. neinas , the college football association 's executive_director . with cbs_inc. on a spending spree that may top $_2.5 billion for four_years of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business . cbs itself could run up losses of a few_hundred million dollars on four_years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong . abc , a unit of capital_cities\/abc inc. , and general_electric co. 's national_broadcasting co. also risk losses if_they outbid cbs for other contracts . while rights fees head skyward , ad_rates wo_n't . advertisers already are balking at higher_prices . `` the networks are paying too_much for rights , '' warns adman paul isacsson of young_& rubicam . `` if_they ask advertisers to absorb the costs , they_'re likely_to lose all but a few who need sports , above all . '' viewers may_not be cheering , either . soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials . at the same_time , some sports events will move off `` free '' television and onto cable or pay-cable , where half the nation_'s tv homes ca_n't see them . cbs has_changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ? mr._pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other cbs programs when the game is over . the billion-dollar question is , how_much are those benefits worth ? some tv people doubt 0 they will materialize and argue_that even_if they do , they wo_n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that cbs could run up . `` as we_'ve seen in the '80s , ''_says roger werner , the president of the espn sports channel , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do_n't work . and three_years later , in a sea of red_ink , the heroes can find themselves with a_lot of explaining 0 to do . '' cbs pursues top sports `` to belie the fact_that they_are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges 0 thomas h. wyman , who was ousted as chairman of cbs_inc. after laurence a. tisch bought a 24.9 %_stake in the company and took_over three_years ago . `` they lost the entertainment crown , and they needed one . and they_'ve bought one . '' on just three big deals -- for four_years of baseball and for the olympic winter_games in both 1992 and 1994 -- pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion . that 's well over half a billion dollars more_than abc and nbc were_willing to pay . -lrb- after 1992 , the winter and summer olympics will_be held two_years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter_games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . -rrb- now , mr._pilson -- a former college basketball player who says_0 a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his_own aggressiveness . next_month , talks will_begin on two coveted cbs contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals . cbs is_likely to spend whatever it takes to_keep them . the potential bill : more_than $_600 million for several seasons , an 80_% jump . a few_months later , cbs 's college and pro football contracts come_up for renewal ; they could go for close to $_100 million more_than cbs now pays , a 40_% to 50_% rise . `` what_happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five_years of network sports , ''_says peter lund , a former_cbs sports president now at multimedia inc . j. william grimes , former_president of espn , says_0 nbc may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away_from cbs and say , ` we_can overbid , too . ' and the winners will_be the colleges , not either network . nor , by the way , advertisers . '' mr._pilson is an unlikely big spender . in the mid-1980s , after abc had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 winter_games , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices . ``_i love pilson , but he was the guy_who complained most bitterly and loudly , ''_says robert wussler , a former_cbs sports president . `` and yet his company is one_reason why rights are so high today . '' rivals carp at `` the principle of pilson , '' as nbc 's arthur watson once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too_high , then he 's going crazy . '' but the 49-year-old mr._pilson is hardly a man 0 to ignore the numbers . a yale law_school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency . in 1976 , he joined cbs_sports to head business affairs and , five_years later , became its president . mr._pilson says that when he spoke out a few_years ago , ``_i did_n't say forever , and i did_n't say every property . '' the market changed , he_adds 0 . and he is n't the only big spender : nbc will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 summer games , and espn , 80%-owned by capital_cities\/abc , will shell out $_400 million for four_years of baseball , airing 175 regular-season games a year . `` our competitors say_0 we overbid them . who cares ? maybe we recognize values 0 the other guys do_n't , '' mr._pilson says . mr._pilson 's `` major events '' strategy jelled after mr. tisch took_over . mr._pilson recalls that in april_1986 , after cbs 's annual_meeting in philadelphia , he and mr. tisch took the 90-minute train ride back to new_york , and mr._pilson used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions . mr. tisch , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the tv business . five_months later , mr. tisch took_over as cbs 's chief_executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time 0 mr._pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators . then , in may 1988 , mr. tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors_that he might sell the network . mr._pilson gave_him one : he bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 winter_games in albertville , france ; abc and nbc would n't bid even $_200 million . that started the still-raging bidding wars . the `` major events '' strategy , mr._pilson says_0 , is designed to notch a place for cbs on the crowded tv dial of the 1990s . it 's also a fast fix for an ailing image . he_sees flashy sports as the only way_0 the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and vcrs , grab millions of new viewers and tell_them about other shows premiering a few_weeks later . next october , cbs , for the first_time , wo_n't have to start the season against the much-watched american and national baseball league championships and the world_series . ``_i 've_been struggling against that for years , ''_says jonathan rodgers , who_runs wbbm-tv , the cbs-owned station in chicago . even_if baseball triggers losses at cbs -- and he does_n't think_0 it will -- ``_i 'd_rather see the games on our air than on nbc and abc , '' he_says 0 . that is n't surprising . regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past_five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' mr._pilson says_0 . but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30_% or 40_% larger than those 0 cbs usually gets . mr._pilson says baseball and the olympics may help cbs move up to no._2 in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back_into the network 's image . and the winter olympics will air during the february `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad_rates for local stations . that will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the pilson plan . they gleefully await the `` dream season '' in 1990 . cbs will air the super bowl , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events . `` it 's made me more committed to cbs , ''_says philip a. jones , the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group , which has two cbs affiliates . the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however . no amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak . `` in this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' espn 's mr. werner says . `` if the show ai_n't a killer , they_'re gone . '' during the 1984 summer games , for_example , abc touted `` call to glory , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks . last october , during the 1988 summer games , nbc relentlessly pitched a new series , `` tattingers . '' it belly-flopped anyway . moreover , sports is hardly the best_way 0 to lure adult women . though cbs might move up to no._2 in household ratings , most advertisers buy based_on ratings for women aged 18 to 49 . cbs may remain a distant no._3 in that regard . nor is cbs a shoo-in 0 to get blockbuster ratings . in recent_years , the world_series and the olympics were aired against cbs 's last-place lineup . but cbs will put the athletes up against bill cosby , `` cheers '' and other shows in nbc 's no._1 schedule . even the boon to affiliate relations may_be limited . the sports lineup may add only 1 % to 5_% to a station 's annual profits . it alone is n't likely_to stop a station from dumping cbs shows . `` the world_series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , ''_says arnold klinsky of whec-tv in rochester , which dropped cbs for nbc six weeks_ago . `` you_'ve got to judge where the network will_be in three_years . '' the intangible benefits may_prove extremely costly if cbs ca_n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself . and avoiding such losses will_take a monumental effort . on the $_1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , cbs is_likely to lose $_250 million in four_years , contends_0 mr. wussler , the former_cbs man , now at comsat inc . nevertheless , he deems the deal `` plain smart '' for its huge promotional value . mr._pilson calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that cbs will lose money on baseball in the first year . `` it 's too_early to tell '' what_happens after that , he_says 0 . but mr. tisch expects losses in all four_years of the contract , he told u.s. senators 0 last_june . cbs will pay an_average of $ 82 million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season . yet cbs will air only 12 regular-season games , 26 fewer_than abc and nbc . that has outraged some fans . it also indicates a $ 50_million drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk 0 cbs took to get an_unprecedented lock on all playoff games . if the playoffs end in four-game sweeps , losses could soar . advertisers are resisting higher_prices , which would help close the gap . cbs signed general_motors and toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four_years . price : $ 265 million . but ad executives who negotiated the deal say_0 that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the world_series through 1993 -- 17_% less_than what abc is charging for the series this_month . moreover , `` there 's no question 0 ad_rates will come down considerably '' from the gm-toyota price , says_0 arnold chase of bozell inc . other admen , however , say_0 rates could rise later if ad spending surges . the winter_games outlook also is mixed . cbs expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend_that it will_take a beating . abc lost $_75 million on the 1988 winter_games , partly_because of its $ 309 million rights fee . it aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers . cbs will add 25 1\/2 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could_be hurt_by a lack_of live events . all prime-time fare will_be on tape-delay because of time differences with norway , so the results can_be announced on the 6 o'clock news . -lrb- turner_broadcasting will pay cbs $ 25 million to air 50 hours of cbs coverage plus 50 hours of additional events . -rrb- barry frank , the agent who_took mr._pilson to lunch last_march , says that even_if cbs loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little . `` ten million ai_n't jack , man , when_you got $_3 billion sitting in the bank , ''_says mr. frank , senior_vice president at international management group , citing cbs 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses . `` it_does n't_mean anything -- it 's public-relations money . '' moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings-getter , says_0 david j. stern , the commissioner of the national basketball association . `` this is n't outlandish bidding ; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it ... . i would tend_to trust their judgment . '' that 's easy 0 for him to say : cbs 's four-year nba pact , now at $ 176 million for four_years , could double in price by the time 0 his talks_with mr._pilson are completed later_this month . that would cut into cbs 's slim margin for profit -- and error . cbs_sports earned_$ 50_million or so last_year . and cbs takes in the least money in prime time ; abc and nbc charge 30_% to 35_% more for ads , according_to a variety survey . but cbs 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs locks up . although sports officials predict jumps of 50_% to 100 % in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad_rates may rise only 20_% . cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few_weeks of prime time . but the savings will_be minuscule . each hour of olympics and baseball in prime time will cost cbs $ 2.6_million to $_2.8 million ; an hour-long drama costs only $ 900,000 , and it is aired twice . cbs may cushion losses with about $_200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds_from selling cbs_records and other businesses . but media-stock analyst richard_j. macdonald of macdonald grippo riely says_0 wall_street wo_n't take kindly to that . `` on a stand-alone basis , the network ought_to make money , '' he_says . when mr._pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he does_n't exactly say yes . `` what you_'re really asking is , are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management ? '' he_says . then , he answers his_own question . `` yes , they_are . that 's the only question 0 we_need to address .
