savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice_as often as they reject whites , the office of thrift_supervision said_0 . but that does_n't necessarily_mean 0 thrifts are discriminating against blacks , the agency said_0 . the office , an arm of the treasury , said_0 it_does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca_n't determine why blacks are rejected more often . nevertheless , on_capitol hill , where the information was released_yesterday at a senate_banking subcommittee hearing , lawmakers said_0 they_are worried that financial_institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities . they asked regulators to suggest new ways_0 to force banks and thrifts to comply_with anti-discrimination laws . sen. alan dixon -lrb- d , ill. -rrb- , chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs , said , ``_i 'm_not a statistician . but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice_as often as whites -- and in some cities , it is three and four_times as often -- i conclude that discrimination is part_of the problem . '' james grohl , a spokesman for the u.s. league of savings institutions , said , `` the data is a red flag , but lacking the financial data you_ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread . '' the trade_group official added : `` certainly the federal_government should take a hard look_at it . '' sen. dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending . the legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race , sex and income level of borrowers , but that information wo_n't be gathered in new studies for several_months at_least . the federal_reserve said_0 its studies in recent_years , which adjust for income differences and other variables , showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites . but john laware , a fed governor , told the subcommittee 0 the evidence is mixed and that the fed 's believes_0 the vast_majority of banks are n't discriminating . for_instance , he_noted 0 , the fed studies have_shown that blacks receive more home_improvement loans than whites . several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift_regulators generally said_0 they have_been too busy handling the record number_of bank and thrift failures in the past_few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination . ``_we would_be the first 0 to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past_several years '' to developing examinations for discrimination , said jonathan fiechter , a top official of the office of thrift_supervision . `` if we_'ve got folks out there who are_being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly , '' said sen. donald riegle -lrb-_d. , mich. -rrb- , chairman of the banking_committee , `` then that is a matter that needs remedy now , not six_months from now , or six_years from now , or 26 years from now . '' officials of the federal_deposit insurance corp. and the office of the comptroller of the currency said_0 they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws . the fdic said_0 it has issued five citations to banks over the past_three years for discriminatory practices . the comptroller 's office said_0 it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since_april 1987 . the comptroller 's office also said that of 37,000 complaints 0 it received since_january 1987 , only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real_estate lending . the agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited . thrift_regulators did_n't give any figures on their enforcement actions . mr. fiechter said that among the possibilities being_considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of `` testers '' -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers . the department of housing and urban_development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing . using testers could_be controversial with financial_institutions , but mr. grohl said_0 the u.s. league of savings institutions had n't_yet taken any position on the matter .
