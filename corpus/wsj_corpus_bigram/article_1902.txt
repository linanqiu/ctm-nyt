insurers may see claims resulting_from the san_francisco earthquake totaling nearly $_1 billion -- far_less than the claims 0 they face from hurricane_hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming_months . the property claims service division of the american insurance services group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $ 960 million . this estimate does_n't include claims under workers_' compensation , life , health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such_as bridges , highways and public buildings . the estimated earthquake losses are low compared_with the $_4 billion in claims that insurers face from hurricane_hugo , which ripped through the caribbean and the carolinas last_month . that 's because only about 30_% of california homes and businesses had earthquake_insurance 0 to cover the losses . however , insurance brokers and executives_say that the combination of the bay_area earthquake , hugo and last_week 's explosion at the phillips_petroleum co. 's refinery in pasadena , texas , will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump . other insurance rates such_as casualty insurance , which would cover liability claims , are n't likely_to firm right_away , says_0 alice cornish , an industry_analyst with northington research in avon , conn . she believes_0 the impact of losses from these catastrophes is n't likely_to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital next_year . property reinsurance rates are_likely to climb first , analysts and brokers believe_0 . `` the reinsurance market has_been bloodied by disasters '' in the u.s. as_well as in great_britain and europe , says_0 thomas rosencrants , director of research at interstate\/johnson lane inc. in atlanta . insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks 0 they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses . insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving_up a portion_of the premiums 0 they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company , which , in turn , accepts a portion_of any losses resulting_from this policy . insurers , such_as cigna_corp. , transamerica corp , and aetna_life &_casualty co. , buy reinsurance from other u.s.-based companies and lloyd_'s of london for one catastrophe at a time . after hugo hit , many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there_were any other major disasters before the end of the year . after the earthquake two_weeks ago , brokers say_0 companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and lloyd_'s syndicates turned to the london_market excess lines for protection of their_own . james snedeker , senior_vice president of gill & roeser inc. , a new_york-based reinsurance broker , says_0 insurers who_took big losses this_fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent_years will_be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if_they want to buy reinsurance for 1990 . however , companies with few catastrophe losses this_year and already big buyers of reinsurance are_likely to see their rates remain flat , or perhaps even decline slightly . many companies will_be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next_few weeks . `` it 's a seller 's market , '' said mr. snedeker of the reinsurance market right_now . but some large insurers , such_as state_farm mutual automobile insurance_co. , do_n't purchase reinsurance , but fund their_own program . a few_years ago , state_farm , the nation_'s largest home insurer , stopped buying reinsurance because no_one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure . the $ 472 million of losses 0 state_farm expects from hugo and an_additional $_300 million from the earthquake are less_than 5_% of state_farm 's $ 16.7 billion total net_worth . since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they_expect to see from the earthquake , it 's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake 's impact_on fourth-quarter earnings , said_0 herbert goodfriend at_prudential-bache securities_corp . transamerica expects an_after-tax charge of less_than $_3 million against fourth-quarter_net ; hartford insurance group , a unit of itt_corp. , expects a $ 15 million or 10_cents after-tax_charge ; and fireman_'s fund corp. expects a charge of no more_than $ 50_million before taxes and after using its reinsurance .
