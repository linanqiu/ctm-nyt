the second u.s. circuit_court of appeals opinion in the arcadian phosphate case did_not repudiate the position 0 pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco , contrary to your_sept. 8 article `` court backs texaco 's view in pennzoil case -- too_late . '' the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did_not intend_to be bound . in the pennzoil\/texaco litigation , the courts found 0 pennzoil and getty oil intended_to be bound ; in arcadian phosphates they found 0 there was no intention to be bound . admittedly , the principle in the cases is the same . but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . and the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different . when_you suggest otherwise , you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation . charles f. vihon
