santa_fe pacific was the kind_of story 0 wall_street loved . since the value of its assets was n't known , analysts were free to pick a number . in one of many rosy scenarios , bear_stearns 's gary schneider wrote in march that its real_estate alone had a value of $_4.5 billion . throw in its railroad , minerals , pipeline and oil assets , he and others argued , and the chicago-based conglomerate should_be worth 30 a_share . and why_should holders expect to realize that presumed `` worth ? '' that was another_reason 0 the street loved santa_fe . with real_estate experts olympia_& york and samuel zell 's itel owning close to 40_% of santa_fe 's stock , management was under_pressure -- in a favored phrase of wall_street -- to quickly `` maximize values . '' but value , it turns_out 0 , is only what a buyer will pay . and with the company 's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real_estate , the values suddenly look poorer . santa_fe has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20_% interest in its real_estate unit to the california public employees retirement system for roughly $_400 million . since the real_estate unit also_includes debt , the imputed value of the real_estate itself is close to $_3 billion . `` the implied current net_asset value of 22.70 -lcb- per_share -rcb- is well_below the 30 level that the street believed , '' painewebber says . `` the upside was in the intangible real_estate ... which is no_longer an intangible . '' so what is santa_fe worth ? if the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of cnw -- it would_have a value of $_1.65 billion . a compromise between bulls and bears puts remaining assets and cash --_including its 44_% stake_in its publicly_traded pipeline -- at $_2 billion . santa_fe also has $ 3.7 billion in debt . in_addition , its railroad lost a $_750 million antitrust_suit , which is on appeal , and which analysts_say 0 could_be settled for one-third that amount . that nets out to about $ 17 a_share for the company on a private market basis . but santa_fe , currently trading at 18 7\/8 , is n't likely_to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would_be onerous . its plan , instead , is to spin_off the remainder of its real_estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets . robert d. krebs , santa_fe 's chairman , argues_that since its businesses are valued in different ways , `` the sum of the parts may_be greater_than the whole . '' but it is n't clear why that should_be so . the spinoff argument , after all , reverses the current notion_that assets are worth more to private buyers than to public shareholders . and real_estate usually has n't traded well under public ownership . salomon_brothers says , ``_we believe_0 the real_estate properties would trade at a discount ... after the realty unit is spun_off ... . and what about the cost , and risk , of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values ? '' some_analysts remain bullish . mr. schneider of bear_stearns says_0 he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief_that he will find `` values '' of 30 a_share . he_adds : `` if for any reason i_do n't have the values , then i wo_n't recommend it . '' first_boston 's graeme anne lidgerwood values santa_fe at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 . her recent report classifies the stock as a `` hold . '' but it appears to be the sort of hold 0 one makes while heading for the door . quoting from the report : `` the stock 's narrow discount to asset valuation makes it a relatively unappealing investment at current prices , especially given the risk that our projections could_be on the aggressive side . '' chairman krebs says_0 the california pension_fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have_been offered to others . in other_words : the real_estate has a higher value than the pending deal suggests . since most of the unit 's real_estate is in california , the pension_fund will_be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards . and , as mr. zell says , with itel and o&y on the unit 's board , the real_estate will_be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least . it is possible then that santa_fe 's real_estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom . but as drexel analyst linda dunn notes , its properties will_be developed over 15 to 20_years . so despite wall_street 's rosy talk of quickly `` maximizing values , '' holders could_be in for a long wait . santa_fe pacific -lrb- nyse ; symbol : sfx -rrb- business : railroad , natural_resources and real_estate year_ended dec._31 , 1988 : revenue : $ 3.14 billion net_loss : $ 46.5 million ; 30 cents_a share third_quarter , sept._30 , 1989 : net_income : 21 cents_a share vs. net_loss of $ 4.11 a_share average_daily trading_volume : 344,354 shares
