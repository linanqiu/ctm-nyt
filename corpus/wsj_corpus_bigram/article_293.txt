the national highway traffic safety administration said_0 it will start enforcing stiffer regulations jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles . the regulations , required under legislation enacted by congress last_year , will apply to imports of vehicles that were n't built to meet u.s. government auto safety_standards and were intended for use in europe or elsewhere abroad . u.s. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year , a small part_of the more_than three million vehicles exported to the u.s. each year . according_to the nhtsa , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the u.s. government , or a person who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle that does_n't meet the u.s._auto safety_standards . the registered importer would_be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the u.s. safety_standards , compared_with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the u.s. standards . congress tightened auto safety_standards for gray-market imports after u.s._auto dealers , including franchised foreign-car dealers , complained_that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could_n't meet u.s._auto safety_standards .
