william seidman , chairman of the federal_deposit insurance corp. , said_0 lincoln_savings &_loan association should have_been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated 0 will cost taxpayers as_much as $_2 billion . mr._seidman , who has_been the nation_'s top bank regulator , inherited the problems of lincoln , based in irvine , calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan_bailout law . he made his comments before house_banking committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry . the inquiry also will cover the actions of charles keating jr. , who is chairman of american_continental corp. , lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several u.s. senators . mr._seidman told the committee that the resolution_trust corp. , the agency_created to sell sick_thrifts , has studied lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 . `` my staff indicated_that had we made such findings in one of our_own institutions , we would_have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , '' mr._seidman said . when lincoln was seized by the government , for_example , 15_% of its loans , or $_250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real_estate from one of american_continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according_to mr._seidman . but the government did_n't step in until six_months ago , when thrift officials put lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after american_continental filed for chapter_11 bankruptcy_protection from creditors . the bankruptcy filing , the government has charged 0 in a $_1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part_of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent_company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals . the deposits that have_been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy_court . ``_i think_0 it 's fairly clear 0 -lcb- mr._keating -rcb- knew , '' that regulators were set to seize lincoln , mr._seidman said_0 . further investigation , he said_0 , may result in further actions against lincoln 's executives , said_0 mr._seidman , `` including fraud actions . '' mr._keating , for his part , has filed_suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift . leonard bickwit , an_attorney in washington for mr._keating , declined to comment_on the hearings , except to say_0 , ``_we will_be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . '' lincoln 's treatment by former thrift_regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands_of dollars in campaign contributions from mr._keating . mr._seidman said yesterday , for_example , that sen. dennis deconcini -lrb-_d. , ariz. -rrb- , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from mr._keating , phoned mr._seidman to request that he push for a sale of lincoln before it would_be seized . after the government lawsuit was filed against lincoln , sen. deconcini returned the campaign contributions . the senator 's spokesman_said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of lincoln because `` hundreds_of arizona jobs -lcb- at lincoln -rcb- were on the line . '' senate_banking committee_chairman donald riegle -lrb-_d. , mich . -rrb- has also returned contributions 0 he received from mr._keating a year_ago . sens. john glenn -lrb-_d. , ohio -rrb- , john mccain , -lrb-_r. , ariz. -rrb- and alan_cranston -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- also received substantial contributions from mr._keating and sought to intervene on_behalf of lincoln . house_banking committee_chairman henry gonzalez -lrb-_d. , texas -rrb- said_0 sen._cranston volunteered to appear before the house committee , if_necessary . but a committee staff member said_0 the panel is unlikely to_pursue closely the role of the senators . at the hearing , mr._seidman said_0 the rtc has already pumped $ 729 million into lincoln for liquidity . he also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $_225 million in american_continental subordinated_debt . some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying_0 they believed 0 they_were buying government-insured certificates of deposit . ``_we have no plans at this time to pay_off those notes , '' he said .
