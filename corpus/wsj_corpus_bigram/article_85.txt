britain_'s current_account deficit dropped to # 1.6_billion -lrb- $ 2.56 billion -rrb- in_september from an adjusted # 2_billion -lrb- $ 3.21 billion -rrb- the previous_month , but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the u.k. economy next_year . the confederation of british industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown , largely_because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to 15_% . `` the outlook has deteriorated since the summer , with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill , '' said david wigglesworth , chairman of the industry group 's economic committee . he also said_0 investment by businesses is falling off . of 1,224 companies surveyed , 31 % expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery , while only 28_% plan to spend_more . but despite mounting recession fears , government data do_n't yet show the economy grinding to a halt . unemployment , for_example , has continued to decline , and the september trade_figures showed increases in both imports and exports . as a result , prime_minister margaret_thatcher 's government is n't currently expected to ease interest_rates before next_spring , if then . chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation , which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987 . officials fear that any loosening this_year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major_currencies . fending off attacks on his economic_policies in a house of commons debate yesterday , mr._lawson said_0 inflation `` remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being '' and promised to take `` whatever steps are needed '' to choke it off . the latest government figures said_0 retail prices in_september were up 7.6 % from a year_earlier . many_economists have started predicting a mild recession next_year . david owen , u.k. economist with kleinwort_benson group , reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7_% from 1.2_% and termed the risk of recession next_year `` quite high . '' but he said_0 the downturn probably_wo n't become a `` major contraction '' similar to those of 1974 and 1982 . still , britain_'s current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the european_community 's plan to create a unified market by 1992 . compared_with the major economies on the continent , the u.k. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next_several months . as a result , mr. owen warned 0 , investment will_be more likely_to flow toward the other european economies and `` the u.k. will_be less prepared for the single market . '' britain_'s latest trade_figures contained some positive news for the economy , such_as a surge in the volume of exports , which were 8.5_% higher_than a year_earlier . but while september exports rose to # 8.43 billion , imports shot up to # 10.37 billion . the resulting # 1.9_billion merchandise_trade deficit was partly_offset by an assumed surplus of # 300_million in so-called invisible items , which include income from investments , services and official transfers . despite the narrowing of the monthly trade_gap , economists_expect the current_account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about # 20 billion from # 14.6 billion in 1988 . increasingly , economists say_0 the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry . `` when the country gets wealthier , we tend_to buy high-quality imports , '' mr. owen said .
