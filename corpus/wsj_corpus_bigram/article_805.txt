after failing_to find a buyer for the sears tower in chicago , sears , roebuck_& co. is negotiating_with boston pension_fund adviser aldrich , eastman & waltch inc. to refinance the property for close to $ 850 million , according_to people close to the negotiations . under the proposed agreement involving the world 's tallest building , chicago-based sears would_receive about_half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage . at the end of the term of the convertible loan , sears could still own half the building , and aew could own the other half . neither_side would comment . the parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building , which will_be emptied of 6,000 employees from sears ' merchandise group , which is moving elsewhere . the new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8_million square_feet in a relatively soft chicago real_estate market . also , it has not_yet been decided exactly how_much of the mortgage aew will_be able_to convert into equity . convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way_0 to finance prestigious buildings of late . in a convertible mortgage , the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity , usually less_than 50_% , at the end of the loan term . during the term , the lender can either receive a percentage of cash_flow , a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return . the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does_not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal . sears said_0 it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year_ago as_part of its anti-takeover restructuring . but japanese institutions shied away_from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear 0 their purchase of the property would trigger anti-japanese sentiment . last_summer , sears appeared to have a deal_with canadian developer olympia_& york_developments ltd . but that deal fell through in_september after it became_clear that the sale would lead to a major real_estate tax reassessment , raising property taxes , and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices . real_estate industry_executives said_0 sears ' investment_banker , goldman , sachs_& co. , sought financing in japan . however , japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too_much publicity . sears then went back to aew , the boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last_spring . aew has $ 3.5 billion of real_estate investments nationwide , according_to a spokesman .
