for six_years , t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george_bush mode : kind and gentle . the question now : can he act more like hard-charging teddy roosevelt ? mr._hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief_executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for great_northern nekoosa corp . nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction 0 mr._hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes . so_far , mr._hahn is trying_to entice nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough . ``_we are prepared to_pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he_says . but a takeover_battle opens up the possibility of a bidding_war , with all 0 that implies . if a competitor enters the game , for_example , mr._hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival . given that choice , associates of mr._hahn and industry_observers say_0 the former university president -- who has_developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold . `` there 's a price above which i_'m positive 0 marshall has the courage 0 not to pay , ''_says a.d. correll , georgia-pacific 's executive_vice president for pulp and paper . says long-time associate jerry griffin , vice_president , corporate development , at wtd industries_inc. : `` he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . '' he also is a consensus manager , insiders say_0 . the decision to make the bid for nekoosa , for_example , was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even_though mr._hahn knew 0 he wanted to go after the company early on , says_0 mr. correll . associates say_0 mr._hahn picked_up that careful approach to management as president of virginia polytechnic institute . assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says_0 warren h. strother , a university official who is researching a book on mr._hahn . but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand . in 1970 , mr._hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building . that impressed robert b. pamplin , georgia-pacific 's chief_executive at the time , whom mr._hahn had met while fundraising for the institute . in 1975 , mr. pamplin enticed mr._hahn into joining the company as executive_vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in georgia-pacific who did_n't believe_0 a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world . but mr._hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he_says 0 he knew 0 he possessed early on . the son of a physicist , mr._hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so_far above his classmates . moving rapidly through school , he graduated phi beta kappa from the university of kentucky at age_18 , after spending only 2_1\/2 years in college . he earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the massachusetts_institute of technology . mr._hahn agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but friends say_0 that 's an understatement . they call it `` photographic '' . mr._hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific . taking_over as chief_executive officer in_1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt_by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business . mr._hahn began selling non-core businesses , such_as oil and gas and chemicals . he even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers . at the same_time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building_products on home repair and remodeling , rather_than materials for new-home construction . the idea was to buffet building_products from cycles in new-home construction . the formula has paid_off , so_far . georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last_year , compared_with $_6 billion in_1983 , when mr._hahn took the reins . profit from continuing_operations has soared to $ 467 million from $_75 million . mr._hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating_on what a company knows best . `` the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive , '' he_says . nekoosa would n't be a diversification . it would_be a good match , mr._hahn and many analysts_say 0 , of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash_flows . the resulting company would_be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more_than $ 13 billion . but can mr._hahn carry it off ? in this instance , industry_observers say_0 , he is entering uncharted waters . says kathryn mcauley , an_analyst at first manhattan co. : `` this is the greatest acquisition challenge 0 he has faced .
