shaken by tumbling stock_prices and pessimistic projections of u.s. economic_growth , currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance . most of the 10 analysts polled last_week by dow_jones international news service in frankfurt , tokyo , london and new_york expect the u.s. dollar to ease only mildly in november . opinion is mixed over its three-month prospects . half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three_months , while the others forecast a modest rebound after the new year . in late afternoon new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar stood_at 1.8415 west_german marks , up from 1.8340 marks_late monday , and at 142.85 yen , up from 141.90_yen late_monday . a month ago , a similar survey predicted 0 the dollar would_be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of october . sterling was trading at $ 1.5805 , down from $ 1.5820 late_monday . in tokyo wednesday , the u.s._currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning , up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from tuesday 's tokyo_close of 142.15 yen . the average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of november and at 141.33 yen . by late january , the consensus calls_for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen . those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen , while the dollar bears see the u.s._currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen . a number_of those polled predict 0 the dollar will slip as the federal_reserve eases interest_rates . david owen , an_economist at_kleinwort benson_& co. in london , said_0 he_expects further cuts in short-term_u.s. rates in an_effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade_gap and to ensure a soft_landing in the u.s._economy . robert white , a vice_president and manager of corporate trade at first_interstate of california , agreed with that view and predicted 0 the u.s. federal_funds rate will drop to between 7_3\/4 % and 8_% within 60_days from its current_level at 8_13\/16 % . fed funds is the rate 0 banks charge each_other on overnight_loans ; the fed influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking_system . mr. white also predicted a half-point cut in the u.s. discount_rate in the near_future . the discount_rate , currently 7_% , is the rate 0 the fed charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral . he_expects such a cut `` because of problems in several sectors of the economy , particularly real_estate and automobiles . '' bolstering his argument , the commerce_department reported yesterday that new home sales for september were down 14_% from august 's revised 3.1_% fall . the drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19_% slide in january 1982 . in last_month 's survey , a number_of currency analysts predicted 0 the dollar would_be pressured by a narrowing of interest_rate differentials between the u.s. and west_germany . indeed , in early_october the west_german central_bank raised_its discount and lombard rates by a full percentage_point . several other european central banks , notably in britain , followed the west_german bundesbank 's lead by raising their_own key rates . and a week later , japan raised_its official discount_rate by a half point to 3.75 % . the japanese discount_rate is the central_bank 's base_rate on loans to commercial_banks . after a surprisingly sharp widening in the u.s. august merchandise_trade deficit -- $_10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in july and well_above expectations -- and a startling 190-point_drop in stock_prices on_oct. 13 , the federal_reserve relaxed short-term_interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9_% to 8_3\/4 % . but predictions that central banks of the group of seven -lrb- g-7 -rrb- major industrial nations would_continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its_own , reacting to wall_street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower u.s. interest_rates and signs of a slowing u.s._economy . g-7 consists of the u.s. , japan , britain , west_germany , canada , france and italy . tomoshige kakita , senior deputy manager in the treasury_department of mitsui bank ltd. in tokyo , suggested_that uncertainty_about u.s. stocks and bonds has made japanese_investors leery of holding those securities in the near_term , thus damping dollar demand . but , mr. kakita added 0 , once u.s. equities regain some stability , players will move back_into dollar-denominated investments , especially treasury_bonds , whose value rises when interest_rates decline . mr. kakita said_0 the key dollar-yen exchange_rate is at 135 yen . `` if 135 is broken , some panic will_be seen , '' he predicted , explaining that japanese institutions are comfortable_with the dollar anywhere between current_levels and 135 yen . jens-uwe fischer , a senior trader_at manufacturers_hanover trust_co. in frankfurt , said_0 he_expects the dollar to recover within the next three_months to around 1.88 marks as u.s. economic_data , particularly u.s._trade figures , level off . he contended_that the fed wo_n't ease rates further , but predicted 0 bundesbank officials will relax key rates in west_germany . alfred zapfel , chief trader_at bank of boston in frankfurt , took an opposite stance . he said_0 he_expects u.s. interest_rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of january after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of november . west_german interest_rates , he said_0 , will_remain unchanged . `` but i_'m not one of these great dollar bears 0 you see more of these_days , '' mr. zapfel said . ``_i ca_n't really see it dropping far_below 1.80 marks . '' scott greene , chief foreign_exchange dealer with julius baer &_co. in new_york , fits the description of a `` great dollar bear . '' he predicted 0 the u.s. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this_month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year . ``_we 're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few_months , '' he said , noting 0 a continuing downward trend in u.s. interest_rates , a shaky stock_market and `` gloomier economic times ahead '' all signal a significantly_lower dollar . in the wake_of british chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson_'s surprise resignation and sterling 's subsequent nose-dive , most analysts had little good 0 to say about the pound 's near-term prospects . mr. owen of kleinwort_benson suggested_that the new chancellor , john major , will_take a tough line in his autumn statement later_this month , helping to underpin the pound . but , he warned 0 , the currency will_remain at risk . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery dropped $ 3.10 to $ 374.70 an_ounce in moderate_trading . estimated_volume was 3.5_million ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong wednesday , gold was_quoted at $ 373.80 an_ounce . christopher hill in tokyo , nicholas hastings in london , erik kirschbaum in frankfurt and caitlin randall and douglas appell in new_york contributed_to this_article .
