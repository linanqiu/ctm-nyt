carnival_cruise lines inc. 's common_stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships . the miami-based company 's stock fell $_1.75 yesterday to $ 20.75 a_share in heavy american_stock exchange_composite trading . early yesterday , carnival said in a company statement that it had_been `` notified unofficially '' that waertsilae_marine industries , the finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy . officials at carnival declined to comment . `` there_is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty_about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said john p. uphoff , an_analyst at raymond james associates inc . ``_i did_n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy . '' carnival said_0 the `` fantasy , '' the first of the three $_200 million ships that carnival has on order , is_scheduled to be_delivered next_month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean . that ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24_% . the second ship , which is half-completed , is_scheduled to be_delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 . `` there 's a 99 % chance that the fantasy will_be delivered close to schedule , '' said caroline levy , an_analyst at shearson_lehman hutton_inc . `` the others will_probably be_delivered as_well , but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . '' she said_0 the company could pay as_much as 25_% more for the ships . if the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect_on the company 's earnings as_soon as the 1990 fiscal_year , which begins dec._1 . analysts said_0 those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a_share to $ 1.95 a_share -- are based_on fantasy being in operation in 1990 . if the ship fails to arrive , those per-share_earnings estimates could_be trimmed 15 cents or more . analysts were n't willing_to speculate on how_much money carnival might lose through deposits . normally , a company pays a portion_of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction . carnival , for_example , has already paid about $ 160_million of the total cost for fantasy . some_analysts say_0 this may give it the right 0 to seize the ship if the situation warrants it . according_to reports from finland , waertsilae_marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate oy waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees . the shipyard disclosed in mid-august that it expected losses stemming_from a series of unprofitable orders .
