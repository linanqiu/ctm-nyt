western_european leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal : the dizzying political_changes under_way in eastern_europe . french president francois mitterrand , european_community commission president jacques delors , spanish prime_minister felipe gonzalez and others have_begun linking the rapid changes in the east to the need to speed_up changes in the west . they_are stressing that the best_way 0 for the west to help the east is to move faster towards western_european economic and monetary unity . this would make the market-oriented system more_attractive to eastern countries , they_argue 0 , and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from west to east . `` the only response to the challenge being presented to us by the east , '' mr. mitterrand told the european parliament in strasbourg yesterday , `` is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the european_community . '' mr. mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the ec allowing a european central_bank , and that the treaty be ratified by 1992 . mr. mitterrand also proposed a separate `` bank for europe '' that would channel development money to the east . one basis for linking change in the east and change in the west is the notion_that integrating 110_million eastern europeans with 320 million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans , despite the u.s. 's obvious strategic and economic interest . says a european strategist : `` the u.s. tends_to look_at eastern_europe -lcb- not including the soviet_union -rcb- as europe looks at latin_america : important but far away . but for us in western_europe , these are europeans next_door . '' a reintegrated europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic_policies . there_is likely_to be a natural division of labor , says_0 francois heisbourg , director of the international institute for strategic studies in london , with the u.s. more engaged_in strategic issues with the soviet_union , and western_europe more involved with specific aid measures for the east . the designation at july 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the ec commission as coordinator of western aid to poland and hungary was a first_step . in part , this division is dictated by economics : west_germany is a net exporter of capital while the u.s. is n't . while american aid efforts have_been limited by budget problems , yesterday france announced a three-year , four billion french franc -lrb- $_650 million -rrb- aid plan for poland . despite sudden changes in the strategic equation , some western_european leaders , especially british prime_minister margaret_thatcher , remain skeptical about european political and economic unity , and are unlikely to let east-west concerns change their minds . but british analysts are beginning to link the issues . ``_we need a western ostpolitik , ''_says john roper , of the royal institute of international affairs in london , referring_to west_germany 's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the east . `` for poland and hungary we_need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers . '' he notes that the marshall plan of u.s. aid to europe `` did_n't just throw money at post-war europe , it also liberalized and opened up those markets . '' the french analysis goes further . `` most of the west 's leaders have finally concluded_that we all want perestroika -lcb- soviet_leader mikhail_gorbachev 's policy of economic restructuring -rcb- to succeed , ''_says hubert vedrine , security_adviser to mr. mitterrand . `` but they have n't_yet drawn the operational policy conclusions . '' he_adds that with communism collapsing and mr._gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the soviet economy , `` our interest lies in a controlled transformation , a contained nuclear reaction , so we_need to help him , and not just with words . '' managing change , he_adds 0 , will_require a_lot more aid and a prominent role for the ec , especially in dealing_with the question of german reunification . thierry de montbrial , director of the french institutue for international relations in paris , says_0 it is n't clear what , exactly , west_germany wants . any push for a gorbachev vision of a `` common european home , '' implying the eventual dissolution of the ec , a soviet-german partnership and the withdrawal of u.s. forces , `` would_be a very , very serious problem , '' he_says 0 . he doubts 0 a bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate europe , but warns of `` a risk of profound change in the heart of the european_community from a germany that is too strong , even_if democratic . '' he_adds : ``_we , and the rest of the ec have to talk to the germans , now , frankly and raise these future risks with them . '' while many commentators , particularly french ones , worry_that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the east might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of american troops , mr. roper in london sees a more positive scenario . `` there seems to be a message from moscow 0 there 's a deal on offer , '' he_says . `` they_want reassurance 0 we wo_n't try_to undermine or destroy the warsaw pact ... . in return , the u.k. and france could keep their nuclear_weapons . he_adds : `` once both_sides feel comfortable , it should_be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east .
