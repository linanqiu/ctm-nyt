this is written to correct a misquotation in your_oct. 3 article `` deaths from advanced colon_cancer can_be reduced by using two drugs . '' in this_article , i was alleged to have said , 0 `` any patient with high-risk colon_cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy . '' i did_n't say this , and i_'m totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote . i have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients . with this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon_cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer . this is not nearly good enough . i_believe 0 any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better_than that . my statement , read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the national_cancer institute news_conference , was the following : `` new clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results . these research protocols offer to the patient not_only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better . i_feel 0 any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity . '' we have very exciting prospects_for far_more impressive advances in the treatment of colon_cancer during the years immediately ahead . this hope , however , will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point . charles g. moertel m.d . mayo clinic rochester , minn .
