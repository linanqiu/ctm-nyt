gen-probe inc. , a biotechnology concern , said_0 it signed a_definitive agreement to be acquired by chugai pharmaceutical co. of tokyo for about $_110 million , or almost double the market price of gen-probe 's stock . the move is sure to heighten concerns_about increased japanese investment in u.s. biotechnology firms . it is also likely_to bolster fears that the japanese will use their foothold in u.s. biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages . gen-probe , an industry leader in the field of genetic probes , which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests , last_year signed an_agreement for chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in japan for infectious diseases and cancer . chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs . that arrangement apparently has worked well , and thomas_a. bologna , president and chief_executive officer of gen-probe , founded in_1983 , said_0 the sale of the company means 0 ``_we will_be able_to concentrate_on running the business rather_than always looking_for sources of financing . '' chugai agreed_to pay $ 6.25 a_share for gen-probe 's 17.6 million_common shares_outstanding on a fully_diluted basis . yesterday , in national trading in the over-the-counter_market , gen-probe common_closed at $ 3.25 a_share . because the u.s. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely_because of research investment by the u.s. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that japanese_companies will buy american know-how and use it to_obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition . `` the biotechnology firms may_be setting_up their_own competitors , '' said richard godown , president of the industrial biotechnology association . he_added that until_now the japanese have only acquired equity positions in u.s. biotechnology companies . `` they_are piggybacking onto developed technology , '' he said . during the past_five years , japanese concerns have invested in several of the u.s. 's 431 independent biotechnology companies . chugai has_been one of the most_active japanese players in u.s. biotechnology companies ; it has an equity investment in genetics_institute inc. , cambridge , mass. , and a joint-venture agreement_with upjohn co. , kalamazoo , mich . the japanese government , mr. godown said_0 , has stated that it wants 10_% to 11_% of its gross_national product to come from biotechnology products . `` it is becoming_more of a horse race every_day between the u.s. and japan , '' he said , adding_that some fear that as with the semiconductor , electronics , and automobile industries , japanese_companies will use u.s.-developed technology to gain trade advantages . mr. bologna said_0 the sale would_allow gen-probe to speed_up the development of new technology , and to more quickly apply existing technology to an_array of diagnostic products 0 the company wants to offer . by 1988 , when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had_been approved for marketing by the food and drug_administration , eight of them had_been developed and sold by gen-probe . osamu nagayama , deputy president of chugai , which spends about 15_% of its sales on research and development , was_unable to pinpoint how_much money chugai would pump into gen-probe . ``_we think_0 gen-probe has technology important to people 's health , '' he said , adding : ``_we think_0 it is important for us to have such technology . '' he and mr. bologna emphasized that both_companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of gen-probe , which will expand `` significantly '' as a result of the acquisition . in 1988 , chugai had net_income of $ 60 million on revenue of $ 991 million . genprobe had a net_loss of $ 9.5 million on revenue of $ 5.8_million . recently , gen-probe received a broad u.s. patent for a technology that helps detect , identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal rna . among_other things , mr. bologna said that the sale will facilitate gen-probe 's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired_immune deficiency_syndrome , or aids . chugai also will_help gen-probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in asia , mr. bologna said_0 . the tender_offer for gen-probe 's shares is_expected to begin next monday , the company said_0 .
