sears , roebuck_& co. signed a contract with bob vila , the former host of the popular public television program `` this old house , '' 0 to star in a half-hour home_improvement show sponsored_by the giant retailer . the do-it-yourself show , slated to start airing by june 1990 , marks sears 's entry_into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home_improvement products . in recent_months , sales of home_improvement items have sagged , along_with sales of other big ticket durable_goods . the show also signals mr._vila 's return as a television celebrity . earlier_this year , public television station wgbh in boston fired mr._vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements . with mr._vila as host , `` this old house '' became one of the public broadcasting service 's top_10 programs , airing weekly on about 300 of the network 's stations and seen by an_average of 12 million viewers . but home depot inc. , an atlanta-based home center chain , objected when mr._vila started doing commercial endorsements for rickel home centers , a new_jersey building supply company that competes with home depot in some markets . ``_i 'm ecstatic about the change , '' said mr._vila , whose new syndicated program is called `` home again with bob vila . '' in an_interview , mr._vila criticized his old show , which is continuing with a new host . `` public tv is in fantasy land , '' he said . `` last season , we did a story that involved spending $ 700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast . '' in the new show , he said_0 , ``_we 're_going to spend $ 60,000 building a start-up house '' for a young couple . while sears would n't_comment on the brouhaha over mr._vila 's commercial endorsements , it appears to be building a fence around mr._vila 's affections . his contract makes him `` exclusive '' spokesman for sears 's home_improvement marketing campaigns . ogilvy_& mather in chicago , a unit of wpp_group plc , will handle the advertising account and syndication . the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of time-life home_improvement and repair books . his other agreements to_promote products have expired . little matter for mr._vila , who complains that `` public tv never paid me more_than $ 40,000 a year . '' he said_0 his compensation under the sears contract is `` a multimillion dollar deal .
