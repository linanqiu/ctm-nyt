president_bush is_considering casting a line-item_veto as a test 0 to determine_whether the courts will rule that he has such authority . mr._bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional_amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item_veto , which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending_bill without_having to kill the entire bill . he has argued_that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending . but some_analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged mr._bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item_veto . such an assertion most_likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already_has such power . white_house spokesman marlin_fitzwater , confirming comments made this_week by vice_president dan quayle , said_0 mr._bush is `` interested '' in finding a suitable test_case . but he also said that exercising a test line-item_veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on the president 's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment .
