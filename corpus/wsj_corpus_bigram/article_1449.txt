the carnage among takeover_stocks friday does_n't mean the end of mega-mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , wall_street 's big-time deal makers say . suitors from now on are more likely_to be expansion-minded companies , rather_than raiders or debt-happy financiers . and they will_be launching lower-priced and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them . this is an ominous sign for a stock_market that lately has_been fueled_by takeover_speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale . whenever the 1980s merger boom seems to be stalling , shock waves ripple through the stock_market . `` the market is overvalued , not cheap , ''_says alan gaines of the new_york money-management firm gaines berland . he recently began increasing his cash_position to 45_% of his portfolio . ``_i look_at where deals can_get done , '' he_says , `` and they_'re not getting done '' at current prices . lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers , investment_bankers say_0 . `` you had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond_market that ran smack into the news on friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank_debt market , ''_says steven rattner , a partner and merger specialist with lazard_freres &_co . trading dried up friday in the market for high-yield_junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . it was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk_bond market , where prices began weakening last_month after campeau hit a cash_crunch . and banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests_for high-risk takeover loans . the group trying_to buy ual announced friday that it could_n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank_loans 0 it needs to buy the parent of united_airlines for $_300 a_share . takeover-stock_traders today will_be scrambling to learn of any ual developments , and other takeover_stocks are_likely to trade in sympathy . investment_bankers representing the buy-out_group and ual 's board spent a frantic weekend trying_to hammer out new terms that would_be more acceptable to the banks . after ual , the stock viewed_as most vulnerable is american_airlines ' parent amr , the target of a $ 120-a-share takeover proposal from new_york real_estate developer_donald trump . trading in amr shares was suspended shortly_after 3 p.m._edt friday and did_n't resume . before the halt , amr last traded at_98 5\/8 . late_friday night , the london office of jefferies &_co. , a los_angeles securities_firm , traded amr shares at prices as low as 80 . similarly , delta_air lines and usair_group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5_% , respectively , on friday and could weaken further . over the weeked , however , two developments in other deals indicated_that commerical banks and wall_street firms still are willing_to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies . vitro s.a. , a major mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed_to buy anchor glass container in a tender_offer for $ 21.25 a_share , sweetened from the original $ 20-a-share offer 0 vitro launched two_months ago . on friday , anchor shares fell_1 1\/4 to close_at 18 1\/2 . for the broader market , the greatest significance of the vitro-anchor deal may_be that it was put_together late_friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $_155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from donaldson , lufkin_& jenrette_securities and a $ 139 million loan from security_pacific national_bank . moreover , to complete the entire anchor glass purchase and refinance existing debt , donaldson said_0 it is `` highly confident '' that it will_be able_to sell $_400 million of junk_bonds for vitro , despite the current disarray in the junk_bond market . donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be_sold before donaldson 's bridge_loan can_be paid back . security_pacific , meanwhile , said_0 it_expects to arrange $ 430 million in bank_loans for vitro . in another takeover_battle , a spokesman for mccaw_cellular communications said yesterday that mccaw has_been advised by three commercial_banks that they remain `` highly confident '' 0 they_can arrange $_4.5 billion of bank_loans for mccaw 's tender_offer for about 45_% of lin_broadcasting , `` notwithstanding recent events . '' mccaw is offering $_125 a_share for 22_million lin_shares , thereby challenging lin 's proposal to spin_off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ 20-a-share special_dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with bellsouth 's cellular business . on friday , lin_shares were among the few takeover issues that did_n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close_at 107 1\/2 . traders and investment_bankers said_0 lin_shares were n't hurt much because bellsouth is viewed_as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected_by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers . investment_bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock-market drop . potential_bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , ''_says 0 mr. rattner of lazard . `` nothing makes things look cheaper than a 200-point drop in the dow , '' mr. rattner says . `` just as there_are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock_market , there_are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market . '' investment_bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well-heeled corporations . `` in the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition_from lbo firms , which were often prepared to outbid '' the corporations , says_0 j. tomilson hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson_lehman hutton . now , `` corporate buyers should_be willing_to re-enter the acquisition market because the competition_from junkbond-financed buyers has_been reduced . '' many takeover_stocks plunged friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks , the targets of rumored deals . columbia_pictures entertainment , which has_agreed to a friendly $ 27-a-share bid from sony of japan , fell only 1\/8 to close_at 26 5\/8 . but several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell 10_% or more . they include usx , down 11.7 % ; upjohn , down 11.1 % ; campbell_soup , down 11_% ; paramount_communications , off 10.3 % ; woolworth , down 10.2 % ; delta_air lines , down 10.1 % , and mca , down 9.7 % . the market -- and investment_bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that have had at_least one bid , merger_agreement or restructuring_plan fall through already . given the weakness in both the junk_bond market and the stock_market , traders fear that these transactions may_be revised yet again . examples include kollmorgen , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a_share by vernitron collapsed last_month . kollmorgen shares fell nearly 20_% on friday to close_at 12_7\/8 . ramada , which first delayed and then shelved a $_400 million junk_bond sale that was designed to help_finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close_at 9_1\/2 . ramada has said_0 it hopes to propose a new restructuring_plan but has n't indicated when it will do_so . shares of american_medical international , which agreed last_week to accept a lower price from a buy-out_group that includes first_boston corp. and the pritzker family of chicago , fell 15.8 % on friday to close_at 20 . the buy-out_group is offering $ 26.50 a_share for 63 million american_medical shares , down from its offer in july of $ 28 a_share for 68.8 million_shares . but investment_bankers say_0 the market may_have oversold some takeover-related stocks . hilton hotels , for_example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling 20.2 % to close_at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on friday . hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . people_familiar with hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would_be dependent_on junk-bond financing . however , they conceded_that some potential_bidders would rely_on bank_loans and would_be hurt if the troubles of the ual_buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers . hilton officials said_0 they_were n't worried_about the drop in the company 's stock . william lebo , hilton 's general_counsel , said_0 plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has_been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . '' ``_i ca_n't believe_that any potential_buyer for hilton would_be affected_by one day 's trading , '' mr. lebo said . but the stock_market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover_speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the junkbond market and among_commercial banks . for debt-ridden suitors , `` the takeover game has_been over for some time , ''_says 0 new_york money_manager neil weisman of chilmark capital , who has_been keeping 85_% of his portfolio in cash . `` the market is just waking up to that point .
