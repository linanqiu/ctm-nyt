chrysler_corp. chairman lee a. iacocca said_0 the nation_'s no._3 auto_maker will need to close one or two of its assembly_plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry . in an_interview with the trade journal automotive news , mr. iacocca declined to say which plants will close or when chrysler will make the moves . but he said , ``_we have too_many plants in our system . so the older or most inefficient capacity has got to go . '' according_to industry analysts , chrysler plants most_likely to close are the st._louis no._1 facility , which builds chrysler lebaron and dodge daytona models ; the toledo , ohio , jeep plant , which dates back to the early 1900s ; and two canadian plants that build the jeep wrangler and chrysler 's full-sized vans . chrysler has had to temporarily close the st._louis and toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there . at chrysler 's 1990_model preview last_month , chrysler motors president robert_a. lutz said_0 the no._3 auto_maker , along_with other u.s. manufacturers , might_be forced to `` realign ... capacity '' if market demand does_n't improve . but mr. iacocca 's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how_many plants could_be in jeopardy . general_motors corp. has signaled that as many as five of its u.s. and canadian plants may_not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity . the overcapacity problem has intensified in recent_years , with foreign auto_makers beginning car and truck production in the u.s. . with companies such_as honda_motor co. , toyota_motor corp. and nissan_motor co. running so-called transplant auto operations , japanese_auto production in the u.s. will reach one million vehicles this_year . `` unless the market goes to 19 million units -- which we all know 0 it 's not_going to do -- we have the inescapable fact_that the transplants are adding capacity , '' mr. lutz said last_month . the japanese-managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some 2.5_million vehicles in the u.s. and that will translate_into `` market share that is going_to have to come_out of somebody , '' he_added 0 . already chrysler has closed the kenosha , wis. , plant 0 it acquired when it bought american motors_corp. in 1987 . chrysler has also launched a $_1 billion cost-cutting program that will cut about 2,300 white-collar workers from the payroll in the next_few months .
