a nickname for measures 0 to stop the market from plunging too_far too fast . several moves were taken following the october_1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures_markets in times of heightened volatility . on the big_board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the s&p_futures rise or fall 12 points . the side car routes program_trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell_orders . on the chicago_mercantile exchange , s&p_500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an_hour . if , when trading resumes , the s&p_futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one-hour trading_halt takes effect . also , the reforms allow the big_board to halt trading for one hour if the dow_jones industrial_average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the dow slides an_additional 150 points on the same day . dot system -- the `` designated order turnaround '' system was launched by the new_york stock_exchange in march 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing . a faster version , the superdot , was launched in 1984 . used by program_traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , superdot handles about 80_% of all orders entered at the exchange . futures_contracts -- obligations to buy -lrb- for those_who have purchased a contract -rrb- or deliver -lrb- for those_who sold one -rrb- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date . most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due . indexing -- many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks 0 to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such_as the s&p_500 . many institutional index funds are active program_traders , swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do_so . program_trading -- a wide_range of computer-assisted portfolio trading_strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks . quant -- generally , any wall_street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques . the newest breed , also called `` rocket scientists '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading_strategies that are popularly known_as program_trading . stock-index_arbitrage -- buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same_time executing offsetting trades in stock-index_futures or options . traders profit by trying_to capture fleeting price_discrepancies between stocks and the index_futures or options . if stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for_example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures . stock-index_futures -- contracts to buy or sell the cash_value of a stock index by a certain date . the cash_value is determined_by multiplying the index number by a specified amount . the most common program-trading vehicles are futures_contracts on standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index -lrb- traded on the chicago_mercantile exchange -rrb- ; the major market index , a 20-stock index that mimics the dow_jones industrial_average -lrb- traded on the chicago_board of trade -rrb- ; and the s&p_100 options -lrb- traded on the chicago_board options_exchange , and based_on 100 stocks selected from the s&p_500 -rrb- . stock-index options -- options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy -lrb- a call -rrb- or sell -lrb- a put -rrb- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known_as the strike price . for stock indexes , the underlying investment may_be a stock-index_futures contract or the cash_value of a stock index . for_example , there_are options on the s&p_500 futures_contract and on the s&p_100 index . uptick -- an expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .
