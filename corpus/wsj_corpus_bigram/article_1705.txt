warner_communications inc. and sony_corp. resumed settlement_talks on their legal_battle over hollywood producers peter_guber and jon_peters , but continued to level strong accusations at each_other in legal documents . warner has filed a $_1 billion breach of contract suit in los_angeles superior court against sony and the guber-peters duo , who in turn are countersuing warner for trying_to interfere in sony 's acquisition of columbia_pictures entertainment_inc. and guber_peters entertainment_co. in two transactions valued_at over $_5 billion . although settlement_talks had_been dropped , attorneys for the two_sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an_attempt to_settle the matter before thursday , when a judge is_expected to rule on warner 's_request for an_injunction that would block the two producers from taking_over the management of columbia . yesterday , in documents_filed in_connection with that case , warner accused sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for columbia , citing securities and exchange_commission filings made by sony that described the contracts . warner was referring_to documents_filed last_week in which sony_corp. of america vice_chairman michael schulof and walter yetnikoff , president of its cbs_records unit , said_0 they had taken mr._guber and mr._peters at their word when the producers told them that getting_out of the contract would_be no problem because of a previous oral_agreement . wayne smith , an_attorney at gibson , dunn & crutcher in los_angeles representing sony , said_0 the sony executives had n't seen the contract because `` it was n't relevant once guber and peters told them 0 warner would let_them terminate it at any time . '' mr._smith said_0 statements about the contract made in sec filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who were n't part_of the negotiations between sony and the duo . warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by messrs. guber and peters that the two_sides had an oral_agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come_up . but mr._smith said_0 sony intends_to prove that the oral_agreement did in fact exist , and that even the existing written contract does_n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio . warner described_as `` nonsense '' yesterday sony 's assertions in prior court filings that mr._guber and mr._peters could in theory run columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for warner . such a dual role would_be `` impractical and unethical , '' warner said_0 , adding , `` that concept is as silly as suggesting_that the head coach of the los_angeles dodgers could simultaneously be general_manager of the san_francisco giants . '' warner , which is in the process of being_acquired by new_york-based time_warner inc. , also said_0 it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $_3 million .
