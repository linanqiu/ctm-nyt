short_interest in nasdaq_over-the-counter stocks rose 6_% as of mid-october , its biggest jump since 6.3_% last_april . the most_recent otc short_interest statistics were compiled oct._13 , the day 0 the nasdaq_composite index slid 3_% and the new_york stock_exchange tumbled 7_% . the coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short-sellers bet heavily_on that day that otc_stocks would decline further . as it happens , the nasdaq_composite did continue to fall for two_days after the initial plunge . however , the short_interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the national_association of securities_dealers include only those trades completed , or settled , by oct._13 , rather_than trades that occurred on that day , according_to gene finn , chief_economist for the nasd . generally , it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to_settle a trade . the total short_interest in nasdaq stocks as of mid-october was 237.1 million_shares , up from 223.7 million in_september but well_below the record level of 279 million_shares established in july 1987 . the sharp rise in otc short_interest compares_with the 4.2_% decline in short_interest on the new_york stock_exchange and the 3_% rise on the american_stock exchange during the september-october period . generally , a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later ; the short seller hopes 0 the replacement shares bought later will cost less_than those that were sold . short_interest , which_represents the number_of shares borrowed and sold , but not_yet replaced , can_be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks . among 2,412 of the largest otc issues , short_interest rose to 196.8 million_shares , from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in_september . big stocks with large short_interest gains as of oct._13 included first executive , intel , campeau and lin_broadcasting . short_interest in first executive , an insurance issue , rose 55_% to 3.8_million . intel 's short_interest jumped 42_% , while campeau 's increased 62 % . intel makes semiconductors and campeau operates department-store_chains and is strained for cash . meritor savings again had the dubious honor of being the otc stock with the biggest short_interest position on nasdaq . meritor has headed the list since may . first executive and troubled valley_national corp. of arizona were next in line . short selling is n't_necessarily bad for the overall market . shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying . in_addition , changes in short_interest in some stocks may_be caused_by arbitrage . for_example , an_investor may_seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other . two big stocks involved in takeover_activity saw their short_interest surge . short_interest in the american_depositary receipts of jaguar , the target of both ford_motor and general_motors , more_than doubled . nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short_interest included adobe systems , class a shares of tele-communications and takeover_targets lyphomed and jerrico . the nasd , which_operates the nasdaq computer_system on which 5,200 otc issues trade , compiles short_interest data in two categories : the approximately two-thirds , and generally biggest , nasdaq stocks that trade on the national market system ; and the one-third , and generally smaller , nasdaq stocks that are n't a part_of the system . short_interest in 1,327 non-nms securities totaled 40.3 million_shares , compared_with almost 38 million_shares in 1,310 issues in_september . the october short_interest represents 1.04 days of average_daily trading_volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period , compared_with 0.94 day a month ago . among bigger otc_stocks , the figures represent 2.05 days of average_daily volume , compared_with 2.14 days in_september . the adjacent tables show the issues in which a short_interest position of at_least 50,000 shares existed as of oct._13 or in which there was a short position change of at_least 25,000 shares since sept. 15 -lrb- see_accompanying tables --_wsj oct._25 , 1989 -rrb- .
