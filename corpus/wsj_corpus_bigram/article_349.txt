bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation , after all . matthew lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought_0 he had a sure-fire winner last_summer when he offered $_5,000 for the best `` verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you . '' he sent out thousands_of news releases from his kensington , md. , office . he plugged the contest on larry king 's radio show , on pat sajak 's television show and on the c-span cable_television network . he talked about it in every speech 0 he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit . mr._lesko figured 0 he would_be flooded with entries by now . after all , he_says 0 , ``_we 've_got like 15 million bureaucrats . '' and in_addition to the $_5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` my favorite bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $_500 . so_far , though , mr._lesko has received only one entry . to make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : a woman from the new_york state_department of taxation and finance who nominated her boss . mr._lesko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible_for nomination by other bureaucrats . but he_says 0 he would_prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file folks . he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest . newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases . talk_show hosts quickly change the topic . but mr._lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder_whether there_is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest . `` is the government not helping anybody ? '' asks toni murray , an assistant to mr._lesko . mr._lesko himself is n't_yet prepared to accept that explanation . `` people hate to write , '' he_says . `` maybe people do_n't believe_0 i want to give this money away . '' maybe americans are just so annoyed with government that they_are n't interested_in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while . if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , mr._lesko admits 0 , ``_i 'd get 5,000 entries . '' now there 's an idea .
