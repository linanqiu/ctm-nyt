two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography . these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars , and from journalists as_well . russell miller 's `` bare-faced_messiah : the true story of l. ron hubbard '' is a biography of the founder of the church of scientology . mr._hubbard , who_died in 1986 , bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church , which licensed them to new era publications , a danish corporation . in 1988 new era sought a permanent injunction to restrain henry holt &_co. from publishing `` bare-faced_messiah '' on the ground that mr._miller 's quotations from mr._hubbard infringed the copyrights . the publisher argued in response that the `` fair use '' statute permits quotation `` for purposes such_as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , ... scholarship , or research . '' district_court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine 0 lawyers call `` laches . '' as for the merits , judge_leval said that mr._miller had written `` a serious book of responsible historical criticism . '' verbatim quotation , the judge believed 0 , was justified in order to prove points 0 the author had asserted about mr._hubbard -- mendacity , bigotry , paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of mr._hubbard 's own words . `` the biographer\/critic , '' judge_leval wrote , `` should not be_required simply to express ... conclusions without defending them by example . '' in such circumstances , free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner . but judge_leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the second circuit_court forbidding a biographer of j.d. salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters . he distinguished the two cases : in salinger , judge_leval noted 0 , the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather_than of proving points about the subject . still the salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials . judge_leval reluctantly concluded_that a few of mr._miller 's quotations from mr._hubbard 's unpublished writings , because_they were not necessary to prove historical points , failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright . but the proper remedy , judge_leval said_0 , lay in a suit for damages , not in an_injunction . the case went on appeal to the second circuit . in a decision in april of this_year , judge roger miner , joined by judge frank altimari , agreed on denying the injunction and did_not doubt that `` bare-faced_messiah '' was a serious work but rejected judge_leval 's argument that the public_interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright . ``_we conclude , '' the two judges wrote , `` that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an_injunction . '' had the suit been filed in time , they said_0 , `` bare-faced_messiah '' would_have been suppressed . this was too_much for james oakes , the court 's chief judge . in a powerful separate opinion , judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing_out that a living person , like mr. salinger , had privacy rights that did_not apply to a dead man , like mr._hubbard . ``_i thought that salinger might by being taken in another factual context come_back to haunt us . this case realizes that concern . '' decisions by the second circuit itself , judge oakes continued 0 , had recognized that public_interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use . and the injunction 0 judges miner and altimari would so readily have granted had new era sued in time ? suppression of the book , judge oakes observed 0 , would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first_amendment . moreover , and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question , `` responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources , letters , diaries , and memoranda . indeed , it would_be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information . '' now , scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation . and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions_on the use of their papers , whether in their_own possession or as donated or sold to libraries . but in the `` bare-faced_messiah '' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act . and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials , copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points . judges oakes and leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship . judges miner and altimari do not appear to have a clue . yet at the moment they_are the judges who are making the law . as matters stand , the salinger ruling , torn from context and broadly construed , is controlling . if an author quotes `` more_than minimal amounts '' of unpublished copyrighted materials , as the salinger decision had it , `` he deserves to be enjoined . '' the courts have not defined `` minimal amounts , '' but publishers , i understand 0 , take it to mean about 50 words . the `` bare-faced_messiah '' decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise . a second decision , handed down in_august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit , is another blow against scholarship . janet malcolm , a professional writer on psychiatric matters , wrote a series of articles for the new_yorker , later published in book form by knopf under the title `` in the freud archives . '' the articles were largely based_on interviews 0 ms._malcolm had taped with jeffrey masson , a psychoanalyst who had served_as projects director of the freud archives . mr._masson then brought a libel suit_against ms._malcolm , the new_yorker and knopf . as a public figure , mr._masson had to prove malice and , as proof of malice , mr._masson contended_that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by ms._malcolm were in fact fabricated . the quotes could not be found on the tapes , and the two judges who decided the case for ms._malcolm and her publishers conceded_that , for the purpose of their decision , ``_we assume 0 the quotations were deliberately altered . '' for all historians and most journalists , this admission would_have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles . but judge arthur alarcon , joined by judge cynthia holcomb hall , took the astonishing position that it is perfectly ok to fabricate quotations so_long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks . in his eloquent dissent , judge alex kozinski observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said , the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at_least his words purged of `` uh '' and `` you_know '' and grammatical error . while judges have an obligation under the first_amendment to safeguard freedom of the press , `` the right to deliberately alter quotations is not , in my view , a concomitant of a free_press . '' ms._malcolm , for_example , wrote that mr._masson described himself as `` the greatest analyst who ever lived . '' no such statement appears on the tapes . the majority cited mr._masson 's remark `` it 's me alone ... against the rest of the analytic world '' as warrant for the malcolm fabrication . but , as judge kozinski noted , the context shows that mr._masson 's `` me alone '' remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact_that his_position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone_else . ms._malcolm had mr._masson describing himself as `` an intellectual gigolo . '' again , no such statement appears on the tapes . the majority decision contended_that the phrase was a rational interpretation of mr._masson 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to anna freud and that in any_case it was not defamatory . judge kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that `` for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is ... a devastating admission of professional dishonesty . '' these were only two of a series of fabrications that had , in judge kozinski 's words , the cumulative effect of making mr._masson `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appears from his_own statements . '' as robert coles wrote in a review of ms._malcolm 's book , mr._masson emerges `` as a grandiose egotist ... and , in the end , a self-destructive fool . but it is not janet malcolm who calls him such : his_own words reveal this psychological profile . '' we now know that the words were not always his_own . `` there_is one sacred rule of journalism , '' john hersey has said . `` the writer must not invent . '' should the green light 0 judges alarcon and hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice , it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens . as judge kozinski put it : `` to invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone_else has said is to assert the right to lie in print ... . masson has lost his case , but the defendants , and the profession to which they belong , have lost far_more . '' the historical profession will survive these decisions . perhaps in time the supreme_court will correct them . but writing history is tough enough without judges gratuitously throwing obstacles in the scholar 's path . mr. schlesinger is albert schweitzer professor of the humanities at the city university of new_york and a winner of pulitzer prizes in history and biography .
