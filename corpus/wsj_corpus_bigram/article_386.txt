immunex corp. said_0 its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging_from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma . the molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor . il-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune_response . the il-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense . but in certain_conditions such_as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune_response so such cells do_n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction . a soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part_of the immune_response without general immune suppression , the company said_0 . the il-4 receptor is one of five such receptors 0 to be developed and tested by receptech corp. , a spinoff of immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial_public offering . immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents . immunex will have the option to buy_back receptech shares after five_years .
