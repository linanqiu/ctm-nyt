international_business machines_corp. said_0 it agreed_to let motorola inc. participate_in a semiconductor research project as_part of its effort to bolster the u.s. semiconductor industry . ibm , which made the announcement at the dedication of a research_center here , said_0 it invited many other companies to participate as_well , including some from europe . jack kuehler , ibm 's president , said_0 ibm is also considering letting other companies participate_in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific . ibm , which said a year_ago 0 it was inviting companies to participate_in some semiconductor work , has_become far_more open about its technology as it has tried_to rally u.s. industry to head_off the japanese , who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory_chips . while ibm , armonk , n.y. , makes the bulk of the drams 0 it uses , it_does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips . and ibm worries that the japanese will_take over that equipment market , too , unless u.s. semiconductor companies produce enough memory_chips here 0 to_keep u.s. equipment makers healthy . failure of u.s. equipment makers , ibm fears 0 , would_leave it dependent_on many of the japanese_companies that compete_with it in other_parts of the market . ibm also said_0 it_expects to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing . ibm already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques . ibm said_0 it_expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has_become so expensive . a state-of-the-art plant cost $_40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $_500 million today because the technology is so complex . and ibm said_0 it_expects the costs to continue climbing . ibm , which said_0 motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement , acknowledged 0 some companies had turned_down its invitation to join in . but it said_0 that was mainly_because the project may_not bear fruit until the mid-1990s . ibm said_0 it thought_0 more companies would become interested as the project progresses . the project involving motorola concerns a technique , called x-ray lithography , that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory_chips . currently , chips are produced_by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip , much_as a camera produces an image on film . but details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images 0 they draw may_be too blurry -- much_as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would_have trouble painting a thin one . x-rays , by_contrast , travel straighter and can_be focused more tightly than light . x-rays have problems , too . they_can make the masks brittle and can pass through material 0 they_'re not supposed_to . but , assuming 0 those problems can_be overcome , they should allow for memory_chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as_much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s .
