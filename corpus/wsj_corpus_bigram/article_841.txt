international_business machines_corp. said_0 its board_approved the purchase of $_1 billion of its common_shares , a move that should_help support its battered stock . even as the stock_market has generally done well this_year , ibm 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $ 130.875 . yesterday 's closing_price of $ 101.75 , down 50_cents , in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange , puts the stock at about 1_1\/2 times book_value , which is as low as it has sunk over the past_decade . the announcement came_after the market 's close . the move by ibm was n't exactly a surprise . the company has spent some $_5 billion over the past 3_1\/2 years to buy_back 42 million_common shares , or roughly 7_% of those outstanding . in_addition , despite ibm 's well-publicized recent problems , the computer_giant still generates enormous amounts of cash . as of the end of the second_quarter , it had $ 4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand . as a result , some securities analysts had predicted in recent_days that ibm would authorize additional purchases . in armonk , n.y. , a spokesman_said that although ibm did_n't view its spending as necessarily a way_0 to support the stock , it thought_0 the purchases were a good way_0 to improve such financial measurements as per-share_earnings and return on equity . ``_we view it as a good long-term investment , '' the spokesman_said . in the short_term , the move is_likely to have little effect . at yesterday 's closing_price , $_1 billion would buy_back about 10 million_shares , or less_than 2_% of the roughly 580 million outstanding . in_addition , as of sept._30 , the company still had authorization to buy $ 368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program . over the long_term , however , ibm 's stock repurchases -- along_with its hefty , $ 4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional_investors -- are providing a floor for the stock price . although ibm last_year produced its first strong results in four_years and was expected to continue to roll this_year , it began faltering as early as january . first , it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes , ibm 's bread-and-butter business . then it had a series of smaller glitches , including problems manufacturing certain personal_computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations . finally , ibm had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk_drives , which account for 10_% of its $ 60 billion of annual_revenue . none of the problems is necessarily fatal , and they_are n't all necessarily even related . there_are also other_factors at work that are outside ibm 's control , such_as currency exchange_rates . the strong_dollar , which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they_are translated_into dollars , is_expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off ibm 's per-share_earnings for the full year . without that problem , ibm might_have matched last_year 's earnings of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a_share . still , investors will_take some convincing before they get_back into ibm 's stock in a big way . steve milunovich , a securities analyst_at first_boston , said that while investors were looking_for an_excuse 0 to buy ibm shares a year_ago , even the big_institutional investors are_looking for a reason 0 to_avoid the stock these_days .
