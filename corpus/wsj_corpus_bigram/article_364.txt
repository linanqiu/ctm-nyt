when the supreme_court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july , the justices almost_certainly did_n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds . but the 5-4 ruling may_have had as_much immediate impact_on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights . the decision , webster vs. reproductive_health services , illustrates how supreme_court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part_of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices . in the missouri case , unforeseen consequences may_have arisen because the high_court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law . the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the constitution . last_year , a federal_appeals court in st._louis said_0 the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier supreme_court ruling that states ca_n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins . but the supreme_court concluded_that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't_yet been used to restrict abortion services . the high_court majority said_0 it was up to the state courts for now to decide_whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . already , local missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two_separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges_against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to reproductive_health services , an abortion clinic in st._louis . the protesters said_0 their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . under a 1981 missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an_emergency measure 0 to_avoid an_imminent public or private injury . '' relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two st._louis county circuit_court judges in_august accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying_to save lives . in another case , a protester , ann o'brien , was convicted of trespass before the supreme_court 's webster ruling . last_week , when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble . `` the effect of the supreme_court webster opinion is that it left room 0 for grass to grow in the cracks of roe_vs. wade , and i_think 0 this is one of the cracks , '' said mark belz , a st._louis lawyer who represented ms. o'brien and the other st._louis protesters . roe_vs. wade was the supreme_court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion . mario mandina , president of kansas_city lawyers for life , says that 0 if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` this will shut_down abortion in missouri . there 's no risk to the protesters , and you_ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there_are 3,000 people standing outside every_day . '' that would_be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme_court expressly stopped short of overruling roe_vs. wade . in two other cases , the possible consequences of the supreme_court ruling appear even more unintended . in one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of columbia , mo. , who was charged_with drunk driving , argued_that his_client should_be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should_be calculated from conception , not from birth . in missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may_have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension . a boone county judge rejected the motion , but daniel dodson , a jefferson city lawyer , says_0 he has appealed . and in a case filed in federal_court in_august , a lawyer is arguing_that missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman_who is in jail for theft and forgery .
