the berlin_wall still stands . but the man_who built it has_fallen . east_germany yesterday removed erich honecker , one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the communist world , in an_effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens . but while it was a move that stunned the east_bloc , it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at_least anytime_soon . for the politburo replaced mr._honecker , who had led east_germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus , with a man cut of the same cloth : egon_krenz , the most_recent internal-security chief and a longtime honecker protege . east_germany , it is clear 0 , is no poland , where the communist_party now shares power with the democratically elected solidarity union . nor is it a hungary , where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a multiparty democracy . still , any change in east_germany has enormous implications , for both east and west . it raises the long-cherished hopes of many germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in moscow , washington and western_europe . mr._krenz , 52 , was_named the new party chief just minutes after the party 's 163-member central committee convened in east_berlin . although the east_german news_agency adn claimed 0 mr._honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for `` health reasons , '' west_german government sources_said 0 the 26-man politburo had asked for his_resignation at a separate meeting late_tuesday . -lrb- mr._honecker was twice hospitalized this_summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has_been the subject of intense speculation in the western media . -rrb- adn said_0 mr._honecker , a hard-line stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the berlin_wall , also was relieved of his title as head of state and his_position as chief of the military . mr._krenz is_expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation_'s parliament convenes later_this week . mr._honecker 's ignoble fall culminates nearly two_decades of iron-handed leadership during which mr._honecker , now 77 years_old , built east_germany into the most economically advanced nation in the soviet bloc . his grip_on power unraveled this_summer as thousands_of his countrymen , dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule , fled to the west . thousands more have_taken to the streets in the last_month in east_germany 's_largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers_' uprising in 1953 . in washington , the bush_administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change . the official line was to offer warmer ties to mr._krenz , provided 0 he is willing_to institute reforms . but u.s. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer . president_bush told_reporters : `` whether that -lcb- the leadership change -rcb- reflects a change in east-west relations , i_do n't_think so . because mr._krenz has_been very_much in accord with the policies of honecker . '' one top u.s. expert on east_germany added : `` there_is no clear-cut champion of reform , that we_know of , in the east_german leadership . '' indeed , mr._krenz said on east_german television last_night that there will_be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups . he said , 0 while dialogue is important , enough forums already exist `` in which different interests '' can express themselves . the removal of mr._honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the communist_party . according_to west_german government sources , mr._honecker and several senior politburo members fought over the last_week to delay any decisions about a leadership change . but , with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity , mr._honecker and several_key allies lost out in this battle , officials_say 0 . those allies included politburo members guenter mittag , who has long headed economic_affairs , and joachim hermann , chief of information policy . both_men were also relieved of their duties yesterday . although other resignations may follow , it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental_change . clearly , the central figure in this process is egon_krenz . born in 1937 in a baltic sea town now part_of poland , he was eight_years old when world_war ii ended . like west_german chancellor helmut_kohl , he represents the postwar generation that has_grown up during germany 's division . since joining the politburo in_1983 as its youngest member , mr._krenz had acquired the nickname `` crown prince , '' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to mr._honecker . in fact , the two_men have had strikingly similar career paths , both having served_as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position . moreover , both_men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy . notably , one of mr._krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few_months ago , when he visited china after the massacre in beijing . he later defended the chinese government 's response during a separate visit to west_germany . east_german protestantism in particular fears mr._krenz , in part because of an incident in january 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds_of dissidents who had_sought refuge in the church . however , mr._krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy . his shrewd ability_to read the shifting popular mood in east_germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor , mr._honecker . indeed , according_to west_german government sources , he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled mr._honecker . in recent_days , mr._krenz has sought to project a kinder image . according_to a report widely circulating in east_berlin , it was mr._krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in leipzig . `` he does_n't want to have the image of the gun man , ''_says fred oldenburg , an expert at the bonn-sponsored institute of east european and international studies in cologne . `` he 's not a reformer -- he_wants to have the image of a reformer . '' as_part of his image polishing , mr._krenz is_expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party 's authority . besides sacking other senior politburo officials who allied themselves with mr._honecker , mr._krenz could loosen controls on the news_media , free up travel restrictions , and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups . but will it be enough ? west_german government_officials and western analysts are doubtful . `` he does_n't signify what people want , so the unrest will_go on , '' mr. oldenburg predicts . at the same_time , the expectations of the east_german people are great and will_continue to grow . says one west_german official : `` what 's necessary now is the process of democratization . not just that people are_being heard but that their interests are_being taken seriously . '' chancellor kohl , meanwhile , has invited mr._krenz to open discussions_with bonn on a wide_range of subjects . reports in the west_german press , citing sources in east_germany , suggest 0 mr._krenz may serve only as a bridge between mr._honecker and a genuine reform leader . adding to that speculation is mr._krenz 's reputation_as a heavy drinker , who is said to also suffer_from diabetes . `` this is a dynamic process and we_'re experiencing the first_step , '' the bonn official adds . the selection of mr._krenz may also disappoint moscow . soviet_leader mikhail_gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in east_germany 's rigid stance . two reform-minded party leaders favored by moscow as possible successors to mr._honecker , dresden party secretary hans modrow and politburo member guenter schabowski , were passed over . if mr._krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure_from the soviet_union could intensify . in moscow , mr._gorbachev sent mr._krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls_for change . according_to the soviet news_agency tass , `` gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the socialist unity party of -lcb- east -rcb- germany , being sensitive to the demands of the time , ... will find solutions to complicated problems 0 the gdr -lcb- german democratic republic -rcb- encountered . '' a force of younger pro-gorbachev members in the east_german bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country . the older generation has_been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if_they did_n't . from the perspective of east_germany 's old_guard , reforms that smack of capitalism and western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being . unlike the other nations of the bloc , east_germany is a creature of the cold war . erasing the differences still dividing europe , and the vast international reordering 0 that implies , wo_n't endanger the statehood of a poland or a hungary . but it could ultimately lead to german reunification and the disappearance of east_germany from the map . which is what the old_guard fears . ``_i 'm_sure 0 they_'ll formulate a reform that will_be a recipe for the gdr 's future as a separately identifiable state , ''_says michael simmons , a british journalist whose book on east_germany , entitled `` the unloved country , '' was published this_month . up to now , that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader walter ulbricht to establish the country 's international legitimacy , followed_by mr._honecker 's campaign to build the east_bloc 's only successful stalinist economy into a consumer paradise . neither man achieved perfection . early in 1987 , mr._honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to mr._gorbachev and joined with romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems . the less-self-confident czechoslovaks and bulgarians , in contrast , declared their intentions to reform , while doing nothing concrete about it . the east_german media soon began presenting mr._gorbachev 's speeches only as sketchy summaries , and giving space to his opponents . by late 1988 , they_were banning soviet publications . the country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought_to travel its_own road . mr._honecker spoke of `` generally valid objective laws of socialism '' and left no room for debate . with this_year 's dislocations in china and the soviet_union , and the drive to democracy in poland and hungary , the east_german leadership grew still more defensive . politburo member joachim herrman confessed to a `` grave concern '' over hungarian democracy . `` under the banner that proclaims the ` renewal of socialism , ' '' he said , `` forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism . '' some loyal voices , in and out of the east_german communist_party , saw the nation_'s unrest coming . the first signs were economic . despite heavily subsidized consumer industries , east_germans have for years watched the west pull farther out ahead . in 1988 , for the first_time , economic_growth came to a dead stop . gingerly , some_economists began to blame central planning . some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy , at_least in the workplace . by summer , an_independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before . but they_are stalwart socialists . their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse east_germany of its stalinist muck , not to merge with the west . one of their pastors has envisioned a `` new utopia '' of `` creative socialism . '' meanwhile , the man 0 mr._krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on east_german society . imprisoned by the nazis during world_war ii for his political beliefs , mr._honecker typified the postwar generation of committed communist leaders in eastern_europe who_took their cues from moscow . he was a `` socialist warrior '' who felt rankled by west_germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the bonn government 's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state . finally , during his first and only state visit to bonn two_years ago , he won some measure of the recognition 0 he had long sought . but ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his_own comrade , mr._gorbachev . mr._honecker 's removal `` was bound to happen , ''_says one aide to chancellor kohl . `` it was only a matter of time .
