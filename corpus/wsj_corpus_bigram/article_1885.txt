general_motors corp. and ford_motor co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of jaguar_plc , as gm got early clearance from the federal trade_commission to boost its stake_in the british luxury_car maker . gm confirmed friday that it received permission late_thursday from u.s. antitrust_regulators to increase its jaguar holdings past the $ 15 million level . ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in october , and on friday , jaguar announced that the no._2 u.s._auto maker had raised_its stake to 13.2 % , or 24.2 million_shares , from 12.4 % earlier in the week . a spokesman for gm , the no._1 auto_maker , declined to say how_many jaguar_shares that company owns . in late trading_friday , jaguar_shares bucked the downward tide in london 's stock_market and rose five pence to 725 pence_-lrb- $ 11.44 -rrb- . trading_volume was a moderately heavy 3.1_million shares . in the u.s. , jaguar 's american_depositary receipts were among the most_active issues friday in national_over-the-counter trading where they closed_at $ 11.625 each , up_62.5 cents . analysts_expect that the two u.s._auto giants will move_quickly to buy up 15_% stakes in jaguar , setting_up a potential bidding_war for the prestigious jaguar brand . british_government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15_% before the end of 1990 without government permission . the british_government , which owned jaguar until 1984 , still holds a controlling `` golden_share '' in the company . with the golden_share as protection , jaguar officials have rebuffed ford 's overtures , and moved instead to forge an alliance_with gm . jaguar officials have indicated 0 they_are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance_with gm that would preserve jaguar 's independence , but no deal has_been announced . ford , on the other_hand , has said_0 it 's willing_to bid for all of jaguar , despite the objections of jaguar chairman sir_john egan . analysts continued to speculate late_last week that ford may try_to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before december 1990 . but a ford spokeswoman in dearborn said friday 0 the company has n't requested such a meeting yet . individuals close to the situation believe_0 ford officials will seek a meeting this_week with sir_john 0 to outline their proposal for a full bid . any discussions_with ford could postpone the jaguar-gm deal , headed for completion within the next two_weeks . the gm agreement is_expected to retain jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual 30_% stake for the u.s._auto giant as_well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures . jaguar and gm hope to win jaguar_shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that would n't preclude a full ford bid once the golden_share expires . `` there 's either a minority -lcb- stake -rcb- package capable of getting jaguar shareholder_approval or there_is n't , '' said one knowledgeable individual . `` if there_is n't , -lcb- the deal -rcb- wo_n't be put forward '' to shareholders . union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a jaguar-gm accord . gm 's u.k. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an ellesmere port site for its first major engine plant in britain . one auto-industry union leader said , `` if_they try_to build it somewhere else -lcb- in europe -rcb- besides the u.k. , they_are going_to be in big trouble '' with unionists over any jaguar deal .
