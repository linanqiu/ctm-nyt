the nations of southern africa know a_lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving . but the nations of europe and north_america have decided 0 they know better . at this_week 's u.n. conference in lausanne , they imposed a global ivory ban that seeks to overturn local policies . a zimbabwean delegate argued_that the ban would `` guarantee the extinction of the elephant . '' legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business . poachers would control the underground trade . many delegates were_willing to craft a compromise , but u.s. delegate constance harriman and others thundered that down . the greens from the first world wanted a morality play , not a negotiation . fortunately , the nations of southern africa have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty . five countries announced 0 they would not honor what one zimbabwean delegate wryly called the `` made in switzerland '' solution . in fact , they seemed a mite resentful . the director of zimbabwe 's wildlife department described american conservationists as `` fat little puppies from urban environments who do_n't know a thing about africa . '' that 's not fair ; they_'re not all fat .
