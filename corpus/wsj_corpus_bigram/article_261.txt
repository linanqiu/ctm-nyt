santa_fe pacific_corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20_% stake_in its large real_estate unit to a california public employee pension_fund for $_400 million , after which it would spin_off the realty operation to shareholders . the plan places an_indicated value on the real_estate operation , santa_fe pacific_realty corp. , of $_2 billion . santa_fe pacific directors are_expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according_to people_familiar with the transaction . if approved , the sale is_expected to close by year 's end , with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992 . in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange yesterday , santa_fe pacific closed_at $ 20.625 , down_25 cents . santa_fe pacific_realty is a major california land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the san_francisco bay_area , and several office sites . a spokesman_said 0 the properties survived without significant damage in last_week 's northern_california earthquake . as a result of the partial sale and spinoff , the $ 56 billion california public employees retirement system would obtain two seats on the board of the real_estate operation , according_to officials of the fund , who described the plan . a spokesman for chicago-based santa_fe pacific confirmed_that negotiations were being held with the fund . also holding two seats each on the board , they said_0 , would_be olympia_& york_developments ltd. , controlled_by the reichmann family of canada , and itel corp. , controlled_by chicago businessman sam zell . the reichmanns and mr. zell , the largest holders of santa_fe pacific stock , have_been looking_for ways_0 to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs . itel bought a 17_% stake_in sante fe_pacific last_year and olympia_& york later purchased about a 20_% stake ; they would_have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in sante fe_pacific . the sale and spinoff of the real_estate unit is the first phase of what could_lead to the breakup of santa_fe pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as_well as real_estate . the debt-laden parent has_been under_pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price . at the same_time it has_been caught in an earnings squeeze . the california pension_fund 's planned investment in the real_estate unit is unusual . pension_funds rarely own as_much as a 20_% stake_in what is_expected to be a publicly_traded company . in_addition , pension_funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try_to avoid them because of legal concerns . but fund officials said_0 the santa_fe pacific_realty investment provides an_opportunity to buy a stake_in a large real_estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties . it also marks a `` major commitment to -lcb- real_estate -rcb- development , which we have n't been involved with before , '' said_0 dale hanson , the fund 's executive_director . under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend santa_fe pacific_realty $_75 million in the form of a note that would_be convertible_into additional_shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price . the note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would_be payable to the fund after five_years , according_to stephen e. roulac , a real_estate consultant working for the fund . the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest_payments , mr. roulac said_0 . the spun-off concern `` clearly will_be one of the dominant real_estate development companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said_0 . for the last_year , santa_fe pacific has redirected its real_estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio . real_estate operating income for the first_nine months fell to $ 71.9 million from $ 143 million a year_earlier , the company said_0 . in a statement late_yesterday , santa_fe pacific 's chairman , robert d. krebs , said that santa_fe pacific_realty would repay more_than $_500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff . that would help reduce santa_fe pacific 's remaining debt to about $_600 million from a high of $ 3.7 billion in early 1988 . it was n't clear where santa_fe pacific expected to_obtain the payment of more_than $_500 million , which would_be well_above the $_400 million that california pension_fund officials_say 0 they plan to provide . the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among_other possibilities . the santa_fe pacific spokesman_declined to comment_on that aspect , saying_0 the deal was still under negotiation . santa_fe pacific_realty owns 2.8_million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more_than 11 million square_feet of space . it also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously_announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in california , arizona and the chicago area . among those are the 1,850 acres in the san_francisco bay_area , including 208 acres in the mission bay_area . the california pension_fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real_estate and mortgages , could_be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments . the fund is the nation_'s largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash_flow now topping $_3 billion a year . fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal_with santa_fe pacific , but they_were approached with the idea by real_estate brokers jmb realty corp. of chicago . jmb officials are_expected to be hired to represent the pension_fund on the santa_fe pacific_realty board , mr. roulac said_0 , to insulate the fund from potential liability problems .
