the soviet state bank announced a 90_% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private_transactions , in an_apparent attempt_to curb the nation_'s rapidly growing black market for hard_currency . the measure , which will_take effect next wednesday , will create a two-tier exchange_rate . commercial transactions will_continue to be based_on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar . but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism , the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar . tass news_agency said_0 the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions . but it did_n't elaborate , and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will_be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut . the current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market . as soviet_leader mikhail_gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade , the discrepancy has_become ever greater . western tourists in the soviet_union who could exchange a dollar -- albeit illegally -- for about four rubles a year_ago are now being_offered 15 rubles or more . even at such rates , black marketeers have_been able_to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer_goods here . they use dollars to buy western items such_as video recorders and personal_computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up . the going rate for a small personal_computer that costs about $_2,000 in the west is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles . even a pack of 20 western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more . with more_than 300 billion_rubles in savings accounts and little 0 to spend them on , soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway . moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble is n't worth much , announcing in_august that it will pay soviet farmers in hard_currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas . `` the absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone , '' the afternoon newspaper izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation . the state bank 's move is part_of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that soviet bankers and economists say_0 is still far away . rumors of an impending devaluation have_been circulating in moscow for weeks , but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise . `` it 's much bigger than we expected , '' said one german banker , who asked_not to be named . the next step , which could have a larger effect_on businesses , will come early_next month , when the bank for foreign economic_affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign_currency . soviet companies needing western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will_be able_to submit bids . plans for the auction , which was supposed_to take_place last_spring and become a regular event , have_been thwarted by a lack_of hard_currency . soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it , and joint_ventures are n't_yet allowed to participate . the kremlin also has_been unwilling to provide hard_currency for the auction , using a_lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer_goods . if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new , better exchange_rate , that would enable the state bank to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same_time . but the amounts 0 they exchange may_be limited ; most soviet hotels , for_example , demand payment in hard_currency from western visitors . unless other rules are changed , the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people 0 it is primarily meant to help : soviets who travel abroad . over the past_three years , thousands_of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad . but under current_rules , they_are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip . at the new rate , that would_give them about $ 30 0 to travel on . it is n't_yet clear whether the 200-ruble limit will_be lifted . if it is n't , the black market for dollars probably will_continue to thrive .
