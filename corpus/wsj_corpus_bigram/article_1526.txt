hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities . of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-abortionists , anti-nuclear activists , animal rights protesters , college students concerned_about racism , anti-apartheid groups , various self-styled `` environmentalists '' and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against aids . maybe he did_n't start it , but mohandas gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent_civil disobedience as we_know it today . the mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the british_government in india . unfortunately , according_to webster 's biographical dictionary , `` his policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil_disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . '' i_am not a proponent of everything 0 gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because india was then under occupation by a foreign power , and indians were not able_to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them . it is difficult , however , to justify civil_disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change . where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human_rights and an_independent judiciary 0 to construe those rights , there_is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it . there may_be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it . the case of rosa parks , the black woman_who refused_to sit at the back of the bus , comes to mind as an illustration . but most cases of non-violent_civil disobedience are not nearly so benign . the public has a tendency to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent_civil disobedience . it is true that both are non-violent , but there_is a fundamental difference_between them . lawful demonstrations , such_as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere_with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed_by any truly free system of government . civil_disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking . the subject of this discussion is non-violent_civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with that , let_me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations . they_are useful to call public attention to grievances , but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute . the delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics . civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture abetted by superficial media interviews . at best , demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative ; at worst , they_can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking . demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile . petty criminals and street people looking_for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an_excuse for rock throwing , auto trashing , arson , window breaking , looting , pocket picking and general hooliganism . soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania . there_are better ways_0 to_promote a cause . where non-violent_civil disobedience is the centerpiece , rather_than a lawful demonstration that may only attract crime , it is difficult 0 to justify . some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like . they say_0 these are small prices 0 to pay for galvanizing action for the all-important cause . the crimes may appear small , but the prices can_be huge . here are two cases 0 to illustrate . assume a neighborhood demonstration 0 to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car . the protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry them away . assume that someone caught in the jam has a heart attack . there_is no_way 0 to get an ambulance in quickly to move him to a hospital . he dies . the demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor , but its impact_on that individual was violent and terminal . assume that a tv network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience . the politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups . in a planned protest against his appearance , several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv cameras in such a way that the program can_not continue . the network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige . the demonstrators have_been non-violent , but the result of their trespasses has_been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute . it might_be alleged that tv has done more_than its share to popularize and promote non-violent_civil disobedience , so the second situation hypothesized above would_be simply a case of `` chickens coming home to roost . '' or maybe the tv network would lose nothing . geraldo or phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters . let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent_civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly , yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole . i_am referring_to those young_men who chose to disobey their country 's call to arms during the vietnam war and fled to canada or some other sanctuary to_avoid combat . their cowardly acts of civil_disobedience , which they tried_to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war 0 they characterized as `` immoral , '' weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those_who served honorably in that conflict . even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections , thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists . it is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily_on minds so morally fine-tuned . worse , it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the united_states to administer the final infamy upon those_who fought and died in vietnam . under the guise of `` healing the wounds of the nation , '' president carter pardoned thousands_of draft evaders , thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's `` immorality . '' the precedent having been set , who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the u.s. yield to the temptation to_avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over ? finally , i_think 0 it important to point_out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent_civil disobedience in these_days of intensive media coverage . give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will_be required . this brings into question the motives of those_who lead civil_disobedience demonstrations . do they_want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause ? here is a good rule of thumb : if the movement produced the leader , the chance that he is sincere is much greater_than if the leader produced the movement . in either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil_disobedience . if_you have not , it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would_have been the better course . mr. agnew was vice_president of the u.s. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973 .
