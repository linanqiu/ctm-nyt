a house-senate_conference approved a nearly $ 17 billion state , justice and commerce_department bill that makes federal reparations for japanese-americans held in world_war ii internment camps a legal entitlement after next oct._1 . the measure provides no money for the promised payments until then , but beginning in fiscal_1991 , the government would_be committed to meeting annual payments of as_much as $_500 million until the total liability of approximately_$ 1.25 billion is paid . the action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts 0 to fund the payments , but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988 . the action came as congress_sent to president_bush a fiscal_1990 bill providing an_estimated $ 156.7 billion for the departments of labor , education , health and human_services . final_approval was on a 67-31 roll_call in the senate , which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with mr._bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor_women . reversing an eight-year federal policy , the measure supports medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest , but mr._bush has so_far refused_to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother 's life is in danger . mr._bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided house , but a vote to override his_position could well pick_up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying_bill . the measure before the conference yesterday funds the departments of state , justice and commerce through fiscal_1990 . an_estimated $_1.32 billion is provided for next_year 's census , and negotiators stripped a senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens . elsewhere in the commerce_department , nearly $ 191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the economic_development administration . and in a footnote to the fall of house_speaker james wright this_year , the conference voted to rescind $ 11.8_million in unspent eda funds for a fort_worth , texas , stockyards project that figured in ethics charges_against the former democratic leader . fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies , and an 18_% increase in the securities and exchange_commission 's budget would_be financed entirely by an added $ 26 million in filing fees . in an_unprecedented step , the measure anticipates another $ 30 million in receipts by having the federal_bureau of investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil_cases -- a change that is almost_certain to increase pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances . the bill does_n't include an_estimated $_1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for justice_department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the house . but yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50_% increase in the required state matching_funds for law-enforcement grants . similarly , the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such_as new_hampshire and delaware a minimum allocation of $_1.6 million each in drug grants , or three_times the current minimum . the odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $_1.5 million for a fish farm in arkansas to a music festival in moscow under the united_states information agency . lawmakers scrapped all of a $ 7.4 million state_department request for the 1992 expo in seville , spain , but agreed elsewhere to $_15,000 for an oil portrait of former chief justice warren burger . senate commerce_committee chairman ernest hollings -lrb-_d. , s.c. -rrb- , who also chairs the senate_appropriations subcommittee for the department , attached $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative , including work on high-definition_television . his republican counterpart , sen. warren rudman -lrb-_r. , n.h. -rrb- , has used his_position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the legal services corp . an_estimated $ 321 million is provided to maintain the program , but mr. rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed . the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would_be delayed until oct._1 next_year , and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut_off funds to service organizations such_as the food research and action center . the bill also_provides $ 620.5 million 0 to meet u.s. contributions to international organizations and $ 80_million for peace-keeping activities . both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal_1989 , although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27_% cut from the administration 's_request .
