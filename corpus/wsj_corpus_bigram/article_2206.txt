kemper_financial services_inc. , charging that program_trading is ruining the stock_market , cut_off four big wall_street firms from doing any of its stock-trading business . the move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program_trading , with kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions 0 it generates each year -- where its mouth is . the kemper corp. unit and other critics complain that program_trading causes wild_swings in stock_prices , such_as on tuesday and on_oct. 13 and 16 , and has increased chances for market crashes . over the past nine_months , several firms , including discount broker charles_schwab &_co. and sears , roebuck_& co. 's dean_witter reynolds_inc. unit , have attacked program_trading as a major market evil . several big securities_firms backed off from program_trading a few_months after the 1987_crash . but most of them , led_by morgan_stanley &_co. , moved back in earlier_this year . the most volatile form of program_trading is index_arbitrage -- the rapid-fire , computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index_futures and options . the object is to capture profits from fleeting price_discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves . index_arbitrage recently has accounted_for about_half of all program_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . last_month , program_trading accounted_for 20.9 million_shares a day , or a record 13.8 % of the big_board 's average_daily volume . on tuesday afternoon , kemper told bear , stearns_& co. , general_electric co. 's kidder , peabody_& co._unit , morgan_stanley and oppenheimer_& co. that it will no_longer do business with them because of their commitment to index_arbitrage , officials inside and outside these firms confirmed 0 . kemper officials_declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities_firms and said_0 the list of brokers 0 it wo_n't do business with may_be lengthened in the months_ahead . ``_we 've_been opposed to '' index_arbitrage `` for a long time , '' said stephen b. timbers , chief investment officer at kemper , which manages $ 56 billion , including $ 8 billion of stocks . `` index_arbitrage does_n't work , and it scares natural buyers '' of stock . while mr. timbers explained 0 he 's `` not totally convinced 0 index_arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock_market , '' he said that `` on an intraday basis , it has major effects . we_'ve talked to proponents of index_arbitrage and told them to cool it because_they 're ruining the market . they said , ` too bad , ' so we finally said_0 we_'re not_going to do business with them . '' kemper also blasted the big_board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders . `` the new_york stock_exchange has vested_interests '' in its big member securities_firms `` that cloud its objectivity , '' mr. timbers said . `` it has never been interested_in what we_think . the big_board also has a terrible communication problem with individual_investors , '' he_added . small_investors perceive that `` big operators '' dominate the market , said_0 thomas o'hara , chairman of the national_association of investors and head of the exchange 's individual_investors advisory committee set_up after the 1987_crash . `` the impression 0 i_'ve got is 0 they_'d love to do away with it -lcb- program_trading -rcb- , but they -lcb- the exchange -rcb- ca_n't do it , '' he said . big_board chairman_john j._phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination to eliminate program_trading . he said_0 the market 's volatility disturbs him , but that all 0 the exchange can_do is `` slow_down the process '' by using its circuit_breakers and shock absorbers . mr. timbers countered that `` the mere fact 0 they put in circuit_breakers is an admission of their problems . '' morgan_stanley and kidder_peabody , the two biggest program_trading firms , staunchly defend their strategies . ``_we continue to believe_0 the position 0 we_'ve taken is reasonable , '' a morgan_stanley official said . ``_we would stop index_arbitrage when the market is under stress , and we have recently , '' he said , citing oct._13 and earlier_this week . michael carpenter , president and chief_executive officer at kidder_peabody , said in a recent interview , ``_we do_n't think that index_arbitrage has a negative impact_on the market as a whole . '' according_to lawrence eckenfelder , a securities industry_analyst at_prudential-bache securities inc. , `` kemper is the first firm 0 to make a major statement with program_trading . '' he_added that `` having just one firm do this is n't going_to mean a hill of beans . but if this prompts others to consider the same_thing , then it may become much more_important .
