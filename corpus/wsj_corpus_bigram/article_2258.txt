in reference to your_oct. 9 page-one_article `` barbara bush earns even higher ratings than the president , '' it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives : `` among liberals , 60_% have positive views of her , while 50_% approve of the president 's job performance . in part , this may reflect the fact_that ` she speaks a more progressive language ' than her_husband , as columbia 's prof . -lcb- ethel -rcb- klein puts it . among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her_husband 's performance . while a quarter of black voters disapprove of mr._bush 's handling of his job , only 15_% have a negative view of his spouse . '' the statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of mr._bush 's job performance and 85_% of blacks approve of mrs. bush . if the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find mr. and mrs. bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy . such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective . why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator . preston g. foster birmingham , ala .
