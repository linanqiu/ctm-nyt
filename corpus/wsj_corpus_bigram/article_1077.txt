in a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to time_warner inc. 's powerful home_box office , cable giant tele-communications inc. agreed_to buy half of showtime networks inc. from viacom inc. for $_225 million . the purchase comes after nearly three_years of on-again off-again talks_between tci and viacom , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in showtime with other cable operators . showtime is a distant no._2 to home_box office , and in may filed a $_2.5 billion antitrust_suit against time_warner , charging the company and its hbo and american television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay tv business . hbo has close to 24 million subscribers to its hbo and cinemax networks , while showtime and its sister service , the movie channel , have only about 10 million , according_to paul kagan associates , a carmel , calif. , research_firm . for tci , the investment in showtime puts it in an_unusual position ; as the largest cable operator , with control of close to 12 million of the nation_'s 52 million cable subscribers , tci is hbo 's_largest customer . but tci president john malone has long been concerned_about hbo 's dominance of the pay tv business , and has_been eager to_keep showtime as a healthy competitor . `` it is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace , '' mr. malone said in a statement . in a telephone_interview , robert thomson , tci senior_vice president , said_0 showtime 's suit_against hbo `` does_n't involve us , and nothing 0 we_'re doing here bears any relationship to that . '' he_added , ``_we do_n't intend_to be drawn_into it , '' noting_that tci wo_n't play any active role in the management of showtime . linking up showtime with the largest cable operator in the u.s. could sharply boost its subscribers . tci said_0 it may bring in other cable operators as investors , a practice 0 it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks , such_as the discovery channel . additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further . time_warner declined_comment . in_addition to owning hbo , time_warner owns american television & communications_inc. , the nation_'s second_largest cable operator after tci . viacom also_owns cable_systems , but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems , with less_than one million subscribers . the tci investment is a big victory for viacom 's chief_executive officer , frank biondi , and winston h. cox , president of the showtime unit . `` this takes any question of showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all , '' mr. biondi said in a telephone_interview . the fight between hbo and showtime is particularly acrimonious because mr. biondi is the former chief_executive of hbo , and mr. cox served_as chief of marketing for the service . they_were both hired by sumner redstone , the boston billionaire who_took control of viacom three_years ago in a leveraged_buy-out . time_warner has vigorously denied all of viacom 's allegations .
