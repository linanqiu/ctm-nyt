october was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost , the official soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation_'s media . for one of the superstars of glasnost , vitaly korotich , editor of the trail-blazing weekly ogonyok , friday , oct._20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation . he had_been summoned to the central committee of the soviet communist_party , after he finished his lunch at the savoy hotel , an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating : eight-foot-tall rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs , all surrounded_by gilt laid on with a pastry chef 's trowel and supported_by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold . why had mr._korotich been called ? ``_i told my driver , '' he said , `` that he was taking my butt to the central committee so they_can ... '' whack , whack , whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm . `` they feel the need from time to time to ` educate ' me . '' and indeed , as he later reported , that was the import of the meeting . anxious allies of president mikhail_gorbachev are cautioning media leaders to take it easy , to be careful not to do_anything that could_be used by mr._gorbachev 's opponents . the government is nervous . according_to mr._korotich , who was present , mr._gorbachev 's publicized tongue-lashing of the press on_oct. 13 was more of a plea : `` be careful boys ; use good judgment . we_'re standing in gasoline , so do_n't smoke ! '' u.s. and northern european diplomats confirm mr._korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no_immediate danger . in fact , a very high-ranking soviet official told an american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated . the day after that conversation at the residence of the u.s._ambassador , the brezhnevite editor of pravda , victor afnasjev , was replaced by a college classmate of mr._gorbachev 's . brezhnevite holdovers have more 0 to fear from mr._gorbachev than the verbal spanking 0 he gave to the press . at the end of the very week in which mr._korotich was called to the central committee , ogonyok was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35_% of the soviet population , a plurality , believed that mr._gorbachev 's economic_reforms , perestroika , would result in only insignificant change . a good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like ogonyok is circulation . when mr._korotich took it over in 1986 , it sold 250,000 copies ; today it sells 3.4_million . pravda , meanwhile , has retained only 57 % of its 1986 readership . glasnost has made celebrities of men like mr._korotich . prevented by the communist_party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new supreme_soviet , he stood as an_independent candidate for congress from his native ukraine and won with 84 % of the vote . the same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the party , he was cheered by thousands_of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the korotich party . but as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are , there_is a fragility to glasnost . censorship is n't a marxist invention . the czars were no civil libertarians . as late as the 1890s , the russian government prevented any coverage of famines . it even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the turkish sultan 's wives . so glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of russian society . it is an admirable public_relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history . it is public_relations of the highest sophistication , that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point . what is that point ? will ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika ? ``_i 'd be destroying myself , '' replies mr._korotich , who then asks , `` what would that accomplish ? '' his answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture . it is the line beyond which the press can report not_only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders . mr. ayers is editor and publisher of the anniston , ala. , star .
