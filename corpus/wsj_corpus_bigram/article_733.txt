mccaw_cellular communications_inc. said_0 it sent a letter to lin_broadcasting corp. clarifying its revised tender_offer for lin and asking lin to conduct `` a fair auction . '' the letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by lin earlier_this week . lin , which has_agreed with bellsouth corp. to merge their cellular-telephone businesses , said then that it would n't take a position on mccaw 's revised tender_offer . earlier_this month , mccaw revised its offer to $_125 a_share for 22_million lin_shares . mccaw is_seeking 50.3_% of the cellular and broadcasting_concern ; the revised offer includes a feature requiring mccaw to begin an auction process in july_1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third_party might then have to pay for all of lin . the letter outlines broad powers for an_independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer . in a statement , craig o. mccaw , chairman and chief_executive officer of mccaw , said : ``_we trust 0 lin will_take no further actions that favor bellsouth . '' mccaw said_0 the three independent_directors provided for in the offer would_be designated by the current board . the successors would_be nominated by the independent_directors . lin would_have a priority right to_pursue all opportunities to_acquire u.s. cellular interests in markets other than those in which mccaw holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless lin has an interest there or contiguous to it . independent_directors would_have veto rights to any acquisition if_they unanimously decide 0 it is n't in lin 's best interest . independent_directors would_be able_to block transactions 0 they unanimously deem 0 would_be likely_to depress the private market_value of lin at the time 0 it is to be_sold in five_years . if lin is put_up for sale rather_than purchased by mccaw in five_years , mccaw wo_n't submit a bid unless the independent_directors request it , and the independent_directors will run the bidding . the directors would_be able_to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .
