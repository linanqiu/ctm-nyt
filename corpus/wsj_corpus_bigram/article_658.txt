melvin belli 's san_francisco law offices may_have been the epicenter of legal activity after tuesday 's earthquake . in the first 25 minutes after his office 's telephone_service was restored yesterday_morning , 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed king of torts . mr._belli , like many other personal-injury lawyers , suspects that the earthquake , which measured 6.9 on the richter_scale , will generate enough lawsuits 0 to_keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time . suits are_likely to be filed against engineering firms , contractors and developers , as_well as against local-government agencies . but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may_have a tough time once their cases reach a judge . experts on california tort law say_0 protections afforded government_agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad . even claims_against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks . the major legal barrier is the principle that no_one can_be held liable for an `` act of god . '' for now , says_0 laurence drivon , president-elect of the 6,000-member california trial lawyers association , `` the last thing 0 we really need to worry_about is whether anybody is going_to get sued , or whether they have liability or not . we still have people wandering around in a daze in san_francisco worrying_about whether it 's going_to rain tonight . '' but that wo_n't stop plaintiffs_' lawyers from seeking a little room for maneuvering . in san_francisco , they_argue 0 , an earthquake was a near certainty . therefore , engineering firms , construction contractors and developers can_be sued for not keeping structures up to standard , and government_agencies can_be held accountable for failing_to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster , if negligence can_be proven . `` my prediction is 0 there will_be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting , ''_says stanley chesley , a well-known cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer . from what he saw on television , mr. chesley points out that interstate 880 , which collapsed and killed more_than 200 commuters , suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage whatsoever . he_adds that `` they_were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the san_andreas fault . '' the flamboyant and publicity-conscious mr._belli says_0 he already_has investigators looking into who could_be held liable for the damage on the bay_bridge and the interstate approaching it . ``_we wo_n't know until the smoke clears -- but yes , we_'re looking into it , '' he_says . mr._belli says_0 he_wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage . mr._belli , who was at candlestick_park for the world_series tuesday_night , says_0 he has hired civil engineers to check out his_own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse . defense_lawyers , perhaps understandably , say that plaintiffs_' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims , though they add that the facts of each case must_be looked_at individually . `` a_lot of this is going_to be code-related , ''_says ignazio j. ruvolo , a construction law specialist at bronson , bronson & mckinnon , a san_francisco law_firm . plaintiffs , he_says 0 , will argue_that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards . but if defendants can prove that they met san_francisco 's stringent building codes , `` that 's probably going_to protect them , '' mr. ruvolo says_0 . government entities , continues 0 mr. ruvolo , could_be protected by the california government tort liability act . under the statute , agencies are provided `` defenses that normally are n't available in the private_sector , '' mr. ruvolo says_0 . `` the legislature does_not want to inhibit the unique government activities by exposing public entities to liability . '' built_into the statute are so-called design immunities , which are_likely to_protect government_agencies , according_to mr. ruvolo and richard covert , a lawyer with the california department of transportation , which_oversees the damaged bay_bridge . the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards , says_0 mr. covert . he_believes 0 those defenses might well apply to the bay_bridge collapse . nevertheless , he_adds , ``_i would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the bay_bridge . '' if there 's going_to be a race to the courthouse , it has n't started yet . mr. covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday , and mr._belli 's courtyard was strewn with bricks . wednesday , mr._belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city_officials worried_about their safety . he said_0 he set_up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal_aid -- free of charge . in a news_release issued by mr. drivon , the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims . the association said_0 it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned_that solicitation of business is unethical .
