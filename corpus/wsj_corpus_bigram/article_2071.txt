the growing crowd of japanese_investors buying up foreign companies are n't all strait-laced businessmen in dark suits . yasumichi morishita , whose art gallery last_month became a major_shareholder in christies international plc , the london auction_house , is one man_who does_n't fit the mold . in japan , he 's known in racy weekly magazines as the `` king of shady money . '' if nothing else , the 57-year-old 's past has its share of dents . nearly 20_years ago , mr._morishita , founder and chairman of aichi corp. , a finance company , received a 10-month suspended sentence from a tokyo court for violating a money-lending law and an income_tax law . he was convicted of charging interest_rates much higher_than what the law permitted , and attempting_to evade income_taxes by using a double accounting system . he 's had other brushes with the law . he was arrested , though not indicted , on at_least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s : for assault and unlawful confinement , for fraud and forgery of private documents , and for extortion . christies says_0 it has had no contact with mr._morishita since the stock purchase , but that it 's happy to deal_with him . ``_we like to make our_own judgments '' about mr._morishita , says_0 christopher davidge , christies ' group managing_director . `` people have a different reputation country by country . '' mr._morishita is a leading figure among japan 's 38,000 `` machikin , '' which lend to small_companies , and `` sarakin , '' which lend to individuals . many of these financiers lend freely , often without demanding collateral . but the interest_rates 0 they charge are often near japan 's 54.75 % legal limit , says kenji utsunomiya , a lawyer specializing_in loan troubles . aichi is a machikin , mr. utsunomiya says_0 , and `` one of the nasty ones . '' in describing that business in general , he_says that when the client ca_n't repay the loan , some machikin `` clutch on like hyenas '' and even take_over the client 's company . last_month , mr._morishita 's new gallery , aska international_ltd. , purchased 6.4_% of christies for # 33_million -lrb- $ 53.3 million -rrb- . acquired from carisbrook holdings u.k. ltd. , a company owned_by australian financier robert holmes a court , the stake was apparently the first of its kind for aska , an entity separate from aichi . and the acquisition , which made aska one of christies ' top five shareholders , left many_people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were . ``_we 're an_investor , '' mr._morishita says , sitting back in his purple gallery filled_with some 20 monets and renoirs . `` in the long_run , the -lcb- stock -rcb- prices will_go up . '' it 's not clear whether aska plans to buy more shares . but christies , mr._morishita insists 0 , is happy to see him become a long-term stockholder . mr._morishita considers himself a connoisseur of art . in 30_years of collecting impressionist and japanese paintings , he has acquired 600 items , he_says 0 , enough 0 to persuade him to start a museum next_year . he_says 0 he spent $_300 million on his art business this_year . a week ago , his gallery racked_up a $ 23 million tab at a sotheby_'s auction in new_york buying seven works , including a picasso . `` he makes snap judgments , ''_says kiyotaka kori , the art gallery 's manager and mr._morishita 's secretary for more_than seven_years . mr._morishita 's main business certainly appears to be thriving , although he wo_n't disclose numbers . according_to teikoku data bank ltd. , which tracks company earnings , aichi 's revenue_rose 15_% to 49.3 billion_yen -lrb- $ 348.4 million -rrb- in the year_ended february . revenue doubled from two_years ago . that is , if the company reported results correctly . the asahi shimbun , a japanese daily , last_month reported that aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing_to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period . the tokyo regional taxation office declines to comment , and mr. kori , the tycoon 's secretary , says_0 the problem simply resulted_from a difference of opinion over what was considered income . the small , wiry mr._morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world . stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes , he lectures a visitor about the way_0 to sell american real_estate and boasts about his friendship with margaret_thatcher 's son . but when asked what exactly he does in business , he immediately takes offense . `` are you stupid ? '' he snaps . `` you should know_what questions to ask to get people to answer . '' not many_people know the details of mr._morishita 's business , but it 's a source of rumors about shady dealings . when a small company goes belly-up , for_instance , the gossipy weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with aichi . mr._morishita scoffs at those stories , as_well as the ones connecting him to the japanese mob . he_says 0 he has never even dined with gangsters . the seventh child of a store owner in aichi prefecture , mr._morishita started out in the textile business . from there , he set_up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real_estate to building golf courses . he spends most weekends flying his helicopter to one of his nine courses , he_says 0 , two of which were designed by jack nicklaus . he also_owns courses in the u.s. and france . the gruff financier recently started socializing in upper-class circles . although he_says 0 he was n't keen on going , last_year he attended a new_york gala where his daughter made her debut . he also leads an opulent life_style . even in denenchofu , one of tokyo 's richest neighborhoods , mr._morishita 's splashy brick manor -- one of some 10 houses 0 he owns -- outshines the neighbors ' . a lavish white portico with a stained-glass window towers over the brick wall surrounding his property . although mr._morishita says little about his business , he offers one rule to success : never gamble too_far . ``_i quit after one try , whether i win or lose , '' he_says . ``_i 'm done in two minutes . '' mr._morishita says_0 he intends_to expand his business to many other_areas at home and abroad . he 'll_be there wherever there 's money 0 to be made , laughs 0 mr. kori , the secretary . `` who knows , '' he_says , `` if he heard that soybeans make money today , he might_be flying out to chicago tomorrow .
