the surprise resignation yesterday of british chancellor of the exchequer_nigel lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy . the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble , as market_participants switched out of pounds . the pound also dropped precipitously against the mark , falling below the key 2.90-mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks_late wednesday . mr._lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts , despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and prime_minister margaret_thatcher . indeed , only hours earlier , mrs._thatcher had called mr._lawson 's economic_policies `` sound '' and said_0 she has `` always supported '' him . `` there was a general feeling that we_'d seen the worst , '' said patrick foley , deputy chief economic adviser for lloyds bank in london . `` the resignation came as a great surprise . '' graham beale , manager of foreign-exchange operations at hong_kong & shanghai banking corp. in new_york , added that mrs._thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline . `` the market was caught totally the wrong way ... . everyone was extremely long on sterling , '' mr. beale said . in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8400 marks , up from 1.8353 marks_late wednesday , and at 142.10_yen , up from 141.52 yen_late wednesday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.5765 , sharply down from $ 1.6145 late_wednesday . in tokyo friday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen , up from thursday 's tokyo_close of 141.90_yen . few analysts had much good 0 to say about the pound 's near-term prospects , despite the fact_that most do_n't anticipate a shift in mrs._thatcher 's economic_policies . mr. foley of lloyds noted_that mr._lawson 's replacement , john major , the british foreign_minister , will_take time 0 to establish his credibility and , in the meantime , sterling could trend downward in volatile trade . but mr. foley predicted few economic_policy changes ahead , commenting that mr. major shares `` a very similar view of the world '' with mr._lawson . bob chandross , chief_economist at lloyds bank in new_york , also_noted that the pound 's sharp_decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered united_kingdom economic_policies . unless mr._lawson 's resignation leads to a change in british interest-rate policy -- mrs._thatcher 's administration firmly supports high_interest rates to_keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the european_monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism , mr._lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact_on exchange_rates , mr. chandross concluded 0 . also announcing his_resignation thursday was alan walters , mrs._thatcher 's economic adviser and mr._lawson 's nemesis . the pound , which had_been trading at about $ 1.6143 in new_york prior to mr._lawson 's announcement , sank more_than two cents to $ 1.5930 , prompting the federal_reserve bank to buy pounds for dollars . the fed 's move , however , only proved a stopgap to the pound 's slide and the fed intervened for a second time at around $ 1.5825 , according_to new_york traders . meanwhile , dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session , according_to dealers , who noted_that thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross_national product was something of a nonevent . u.s. gnp rose at an annual_rate of 2.5_% in the third_quarter . the implicit price deflator , a measure of inflation , was down to a 2.9_% annual_rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6_% rate of gain in the second_quarter . in europe , the dollar ended lower in dull trading . the market closed prior to mr._lawson 's announcement . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery rose $ 3.40 to $ 372.50 an_ounce in heavy_trading . the close was the highest since august 3 . estimated_volume was five million_ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong friday , gold was_quoted at $ 370.85 an_ounce .
