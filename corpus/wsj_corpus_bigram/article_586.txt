now you see it , now you_do n't . the recession , that is . the economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up . so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane . for the past seven_years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy . some may_have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession . different tactics are called for , as losing_money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher . for those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will_be a recession year , many_economists and money_managers agree on steps that can_be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio . in a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than_usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries . a heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along_with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds . it 's tempting to think_0 these defensive steps can_be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand . but that may_not be possible , because recessions often take investors by surprise . `` they always seem to come a_bit later than you expect . when they do hit , they hit fast , ''_says david a. wyss , chief_financial economist_at the data resources division of mcgraw-hill inc . though he himself does_n't expect a recession soon , mr. wyss advises people_who do that `` the best thing 0 to be in is long that is , 20-year to 30-year_treasury bonds . '' the reason is simple , mr. wyss says_0 : `` interest_rates almost always decline during recession . '' as surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest_rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . they_are worth more because_they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do . that effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds . but short-term bonds ca_n't rise too_much , because everyone knows 0 they will_be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon . long-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price . but not just any bonds will do . corporate_bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' mr. wyss says . as times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money 0 to pay their debts . this hurts the price of corporate_bonds . also , he notes 0 , `` most corporate_bonds are callable . '' that means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy_back its bonds by paying investors the face_value -lrb- plus , in some_cases , a sweetener -rrb- . when interest_rates have dropped , it makes_sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . but the investors are left stranded with money 0 to reinvest at a time when interest_rates are puny . if corporate_bonds are bad in recessions , junk_bonds are_likely to be the worst of all . it 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get_out of junk_bonds when a recession is in the offing , says_0 avner arbel , professor of finance at cornell university . `` such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could_be a disaster . '' municipal_bonds are generally a_bit safer than corporate_bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal_government . during an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated_with at_least some municipals . and , like corporates , many municipal_bonds are callable . but a few experts , going against the consensus , do_n't think_0 bonds would help investors even_if a recession is in the offing . one of these is jeffrey l. beach , director of research for underwood neuhaus &_co. , a brokerage house in houston , who thinks that ``_we 're either in a recession or about to go_into one . '' what 's more , he_thinks 0 this could_be a nastier recession than_usual : `` once the downturn comes , it 's going_to be very_hard 0 to reverse . '' investors , he advises 0 , `` should_be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than_usual and also shunning bonds . because he_sees a `` 5_% to 6_% base_rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest_rates will fall much any time soon . instead , mr. beach says_0 , investors `` probably should_be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market_funds and treasury_bills . greg confair , president of sigma financial inc. in allentown , pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . he is n't sure_0 a recession is coming , but says_0 the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . `` this late in an expansion , '' the economy tends_to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , mr. confair says_0 . the federal_reserve board 's plan for a `` soft_landing , '' he_says 0 , requires the fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . '' a soft_landing is n't something that can_be achieved once and for all , mr. confair adds 0 . it has to be engineered over and over again , month after month . he_believes that the task facing fed_chairman alan_greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . '' and , in a sense , that 's the kind_of task 0 individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors_' portfolios . it comes down to a question of whether to try_to `` time '' the market . for people_who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have_been rewarding long-term investments . most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9_% to 10_% , including both dividends and price appreciation . that 's well_above what bonds or bank certificates have paid . moreover , because no_one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some_analysts think_0 investors should n't even worry too_much about timing . `` trying_to time the economy is a mistake , ''_says david katz , chief investment officer of value matrix management_inc. in new_york . mr. katz notes that some_economists have_been predicting a recession for at_least two_years . investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he_says 0 . mr. katz adds that people_who jump in and out of the stock_market need to be right about 70_% of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy . frequent trading runs up high commission costs . and the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock_market 's gains over time . still , few investors are able_to sit tight when they_are convinced 0 a recession is coming . after all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined . according_to ned davis , president of ned davis research inc. in nokomis , fla. , the average drop in the dow_jones industrial_average was about 21_% , and the decrease began an_average of six_months before a recession officially started . by the time 0 a recession is `` official '' -lrb- two consecutive quarters of declining gross_national product -rrb- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done - and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over . about six_months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anticipate a recovery . the average recession lasts about a year . unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca_n't reliably be_used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases . but whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession . for the portion_of an_investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number_of suggestions . mr. katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the company 's earnings_per share . `` low p-e '' stocks , he_says 0 , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . '' in good times , he_says 0 , they lag a_bit , but overall they provide superior performance . prof. arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small_companies . small-company shares typically fall more_than big-company stocks in a recession , he_says 0 . and in any_case , he argues 0 , stocks of small_companies are `` almost as overpriced as they_were sept._30 , 1987 , just before the crash . '' for_example , mr. arbel says_0 , stocks of small_companies are selling for about 19 times cash_flow . -lrb- cash_flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . -rrb- that ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market_crash , mr. arbel says_0 . and it 's way above the ratio -lrb- 7.5 times cash_flow -rrb- that bigger companies are selling for . another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries . food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples . recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they_'re sick . george putnam iii , editor of turnaround letter in boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors . `` keep some money available for opportunities , '' he_says . `` if the recession does hit , there will_be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest .
