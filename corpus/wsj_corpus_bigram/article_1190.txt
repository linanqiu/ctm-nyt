houston attorney dale friend , representing a plaintiff in a damage suit , says_0 he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his_client . literally . it turns_out 0 mr. friend 's client , machelle parks of cincinnati , did_n't like the way_0 defense attorney tom alexander acted during the legal proceedings . so she has_agreed to forgo monetary damages against mr._alexander 's client in return for the right to punch the attorney . ms. parks 's mother also gets to cuff mr._alexander . so does mr. friend and his law partner , nick nichols . the bizarre arrangement grows out of mr._alexander 's representation of derr construction co. , one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by ms. parks , the widow of a construction worker killed in january_1987 while working on a new houston convention center . last_month , mr. friend says_0 , mr._alexander 's associate agreed that derr would pay $_50,000 as_part of an overall settlement . but mr._alexander scuttled the deal at the last_minute , angering the plaintiff 's side . ``_i never agreed_to it , '' mr._alexander says , adding_that `` it 's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements . '' when ms. parks and her_mother heard about what had happened , mr. friend says_0 , they volunteered that they would like to give mr._alexander a good walloping . mr. friend says_0 he passed that along to his adversary , and soon they_were talking_about the ground rules under which derr could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at mr._alexander . although time and place have yet to be_determined , some details are in place . mr. friend says_0 he agreed_to strike mr._alexander above the belt . ms. parks and her_mother indicated 0 they_want to `` catch him unawares from behind , '' he_says 0 . mr._alexander , for his part , insisted_that the punchers ca_n't assign their pummeling rights to anyone_else , ca_n't use a blunt instrument and ca_n't take a running start . mr._alexander says_0 he regards the agreement , which has n't been submitted to a judge , as something of a joke . however , he acknowledges 0 they `` have the option of taking a swat at me if_they really want to . '' mr. friend says_0 his side is `` dead serious . '' although they do_n't contemplate delivering any disabling blows , he_says that mr._alexander will_be asked to sign a release from liability , just in case .
