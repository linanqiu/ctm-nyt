diversification pays . that 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once_again in the performance of mutual_funds during and after the stock_market 's friday-the-13th plunge . stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more_than 2_% in the week through last_thursday , according_to figures compiled_by lipper_analytical services_inc . that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday , last monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed . but several other types_of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide . funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds . `` more_than ever , people should realize 0 they should have a diversified portfolio , '' said jeremy duffield , a senior_vice president of vanguard_group . `` that means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real_estate . '' one week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision . but the latest mutual_fund performance figures do show what can_happen when the going gets rough . `` you_want to know_how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said kurt brouwer , an investment_adviser with brouwer & janachowski in san_francisco . `` it 's like kicking the tires of a car ... . what you_want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going_to perform ? '' general equity funds fell an_average of 2.35 % in the week_ended thursday , compared_with a 2.32 % slide for the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index . but lipper_analytical 's figures show that there_were a number_of ways_0 investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock_market 's gyrations . gold-oriented funds , for_instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an_average decline of 1.15 % . flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about_half the rate of stock funds -- an_average drop of 1.27 % , according_to lipper . global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at_least 25_% of their_portfolios outside the u.s. . this gives_them the added benefits of international diversification --_including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like the past_week , when the dollar declines against other major_currencies . with all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07 % in the week through last_thursday . but while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price 0 to pay : a diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot . and friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have_been this_year 's hot investment . thus , even including the latest_week , the average general stock fund has soared more_than 24_% so_far this_year , the lipper_analytical figures show 0 . by_comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an_average total_return of about 19_% , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17_% . fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend_to be volatile , have_risen just 4.55 % , on average . `` that 's the problem with trying_to hedge too_much , '' said mr. brouwer . `` you_do n't make any real money . '' over the last 20_years , for_example , mr. brouwer says , an_investor putting $_5,000 a year in the s&p_500 would_have made nearly twice_as much than if it were invested in treasury_bills . some equity funds did better_than others in the week that began on friday the 13th . the $_4 million monetta fund , for_instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return . its return so_far this_year has_been a credible 21.71 % . the fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30_% over its cost . by the time 0 the market plummeted 10 days ago , monetta was 55_% in cash , said_0 robert bacarella , president and portfolio_manager . last monday , he started `` buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . '' among mr. bacarella 's picks : oracle systems , reebok international_ltd. and digital microwave corp . the fund 's cash_position is now about 22_% , which mr. bacarella calls `` still bearish . '' among the big stock funds , dreyfus fund , with more_than $_2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year . howard stein , chairman of dreyfus corp. , said_0 the fund was about_half invested in government bonds on_oct. 13 , and about 10_% in cash . `` in a downward market , bonds act better , '' he said . ``_we still think_0 there 's a_lot of unsettlement in this market . we_believe 0 interest_rates will_continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . '' many of the funds that did best in the last_week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign_currency translations when the dollar is weak . from its high point on thursday , oct._12 , to where it traded late in new_york a week later , the dollar fell 3.6_% against the west_german mark , 3.4 % against the british_pound and 2.1 % against the japanese yen . three international cash portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest_week . because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign_currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar . but when the dollar rises against major foreign_currencies , as it did for much of this_year , the dollar value of these funds declines . all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date . of the funds that fared the worst in the post-oct . 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the ual_corp . buy-out plan . reflecting airline takeover_activity , however , both the fidelity select air transportation portfolio and the national aviation & technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the fidelity air transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for national aviation & technology . the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest_week may_not necessarily be a good sign , said_0 a. michael lipper , president of lipper_analytical . noting_that equity funds are up nearly 60_% from their post-crash low on dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what_happened last_week `` may_not be enough of an adjustment . there 's either more 0 to come or an extremely long period of dullness . '' but investors do_n't seem to think so . several big mutual_fund groups said last_week that cash_flows into stock funds were heavier than_usual after heavy outflows on the 13th . vanguard_group said_0 it had a more_than $ 50_million net inflow into its stock funds last_week . `` there certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said steven norwitz , a vice_president at t._rowe price associates . `` people showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities .
