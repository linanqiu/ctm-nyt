the financial accounting_standards board said_0 it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments . but the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part_of its original proposal made earlier_this year that would_have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments . the balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt 0 the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures . under the initial proposal , for_example , banks would_have been required to disclose that portion_of allowances for loan_losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted . the final rule wo_n't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan_losses , which appears on the balance_sheet . the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest_rate swaps , financial guarantees , foward interest_rate contracts , loan contracts , loan commitments and options written on securites held . it will_require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments . the rule will_require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments , any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform , and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument . scott miller , an fasb project manager , said that a final rule will_be issued before year end . but he_noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had_been delayed by six_months .
