investors bailed out of new_york city bonds in droves last_week , driving prices lower and boosting yields . one bond trader estimated that more_than $ 50_million of new_york city general_obligation bonds were put_up for sale friday alone . while that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , friday_'s selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual_investors . ``_i 've_never seen so_many -lcb- new_york city -rcb- g.o. 's up for sale , '' said another trader . `` every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . '' municipal bond analysts said_0 the sell-off was_triggered by concerns_about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900_million bond_offering coming soon , and political uncertainty . a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond_issue , but did say that a general_obligation offering is in the works and should_be priced sometime in the next two_weeks , before the november mayoral election . -lrb- general_obligation bonds are backed_by the city 's overall revenues and credit . -rrb- although many investors were aware that a bond_offering was being scheduled , many expected a much_smaller amount of bonds to be_sold . the fact_that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new_york 's budgetary problems are more serious than had_been expected . new_york , one of the nation_'s largest issuers of tax-exempt_bonds , sold $_750 million of municipal_bonds just a few_weeks ago . there have_been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the october_1987 stock_market crash continues to make itself felt . the recent sharp stock_market decline exacerbated those concerns . meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding . rumors persisted last_week that new_york 's credit_ratings -- single-a from moody_'s investors_service inc. and single-a-minus from standard_& poor_'s corp. -- are at risk . the weakness in new_york city bonds follows a warning from new_york state comptroller edward regan that the 1987_crash seriously weakened the city 's economy . in a study , the comptroller said , `` the city 's glory days are over . '' mr. regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases 0 to address the city 's problems in the next_few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the new_york city economy . '' new_york city 's revised financial plan , due out later_this month , is_expected to include measures 0 to balance the city 's $ 27 billion budget . at present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $_500 million to $_600 million for the fiscal_year ending_june 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit . mark page , new_york 's deputy_director of finance , said that investors_' concerns_about the city 's financial health are `` unwarranted given our proven ability_to manage ourselves . '' he charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . '' there_are also questions_about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial_crisis . the leading contender for the mayoral office , democrat david_dinkins , has_been criticized recently for the way_0 he handled his personal financial affairs . and the controversy has led to uncertainty_about the outcome of the election . until last_week , mr._dinkins was considered a shoo-in . `` the market can adjust to good_news or bad_news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said bernard b. beal , chief_executive of m.r. beal &_co. , a securities_firm that specializes_in the municipal market . until last_week , `` everyone felt certain 0 they knew the outcome of the election . now , there have_been a number_of questions raised . '' last_week , yields_on long-term new_york city general_obligation bonds jumped half a percentage_point . new_york city 's 6_% bonds_due 2018 , for_example , were_quoted late_friday at a price 0 to yield 7.80 % , compared_with 7.60_% thursday . as the yield on new_york general_obligation bonds rose , the bond buyer 20-bond general_obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week_ended oct._19 .
