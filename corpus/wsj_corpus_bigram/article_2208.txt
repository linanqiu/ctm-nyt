at a time when jon levy should_be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company 's 17 years , his work day is studded with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers , campeau corp . `` the dress business has always been a gamble , but it 's never been like this , ''_says mr. levy , president of st. gillian group ltd. , which has_become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy tv commercials . every_day , mr. levy checks orders from campeau department_store chains , trying_to guess if he will_be paid . ``_i 'm now monitoring every major account . '' campeau , owner of such retailers as bloomingdale_'s , bon marche , and jordan marsh , sidestepped financial collapse last_month after an_emergency $_250 million loan from olympia_& york_developments ltd. , a canadian developer and a major_shareholder in campeau . the need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had_been told at the company 's annual_meeting in july that there_were n't any major problems ahead . the risk of doing_business with campeau 's federated and allied department_store chains is about to increase greatly , not_only for mr. levy but for hundreds_of other small apparel makers , button suppliers , trucking firms and fabric houses . next_week , the country 's top designers and manufacturers will_begin showing fashions for spring 1990 , the second most_important selling season of the year . and as the applause dies down in showrooms along seventh avenue and broadway , stylishly clad campeau buyers will_begin writing orders . orders from campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration . this is no_longer true because of campeau 's massive debt_load . `` it 's all 0 anybody wants to talk_about , ''_says richard posner , executive_vice president for credit exchange inc. , a leading credit service . `` people wonder what 's going_to happen next . '' many manufacturers are worried_about being paid for merchandise already shipped to campeau stores . but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to campeau stores . `` the few million dollars 0 i could lose today is nothing against what i could lose on the spring line , ''_says mr. levy , who estimates that campeau stores will sell $ 25 million worth of his clothes this_year . ``_i 'm buying fabric right_now for clothes which i may_not be_paid for until april or may . what_happens to me if campeau collapses between now and then ? '' some credit concerns , such_as bernard sands credit consultants inc. , have told clients not to ship anything to federated or allied stores on credit . `` this is especially true for spring merchandise , ''_says jim rindos , credit manager at bernard sands . `` campeau has too_much debt . '' other credit houses , such_as credit exchange and solo credit service corp. , are suggesting_that their_clients study each order before shipping . `` payments are good right_now , but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit , ''_says richard hastings , a retail credit analyst , referring_to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic . `` the campeau situation is a little uncertain and very_difficult 0 to analyze . '' because of those concerns , some manufacturers say_0 they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise . ``_we 're being paid today , but we_'re worried_about tomorrow and will want '' letters of credit , says_0 the sales director at one major dress maker who asked_not to be_identified . howard bloom , president of the dress firm chetta b inc. , says : `` it 's big time chaos today . i_'m going_to ship and hope 0 i get paid . if i need to ask for money up front later , i will . '' carol sanger , vice_president , corporate communications at campeau , says that all of the federated and allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner . `` they continue to pay their bills and will do_so , ''_says ms. sanger . ``_we 're confident 0 we_'ll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as_well . '' typically , manufacturers are paid 10 days after the month in which they ship . if goods are shipped to bloomingdale_'s between oct._1 and oct._20 , manufacturers expect to be_paid by nov._10 . but manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo_n't be_paid until march , april or even may . some in the market question_whether campeau will_be in a position 0 to pay bills at that time . `` everybody is worried_about the possibility of cancellations , ''_says kurt barnard , publisher of barnard 's retail marketing report . `` the buyers who work for the various campeau chains may lose their jobs . the stores 0 they work for may_be sold . what that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess . '' campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an_estimated $ 1.23 billion in debt due next_spring . this includes a working_capital facility for allied stores of $_350 million that matures march 15 , 1990 , and an $_800 million bridge_loan due april 30 , 1990 . the company has stated in recently_filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its march 1990 payments . in recent_months , numerous retailers have filed for chapter_11 bankruptcy_protection , including bonwit_teller , b._altman &_co. , and miller & rhoads inc . those filings , plus the expected sale of a number_of financially healthy chains , such_as saks_fifth avenue , marshall_field 's and bloomingdale_'s , have added to the anxiety . `` right_now , federated owes us a considerable amount of money , ''_says morris marmalstein , president of david warren enterprises , a major dress manufacturer . ``_we expect 0 they will_be current with their debts by the end of the week , but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders . '' mr. marmalstein adds that his company is now holding some goods in_anticipation of being paid in full . `` it 's become a day-by-day business , '' he_says . `` business has never been this tough before . not_only does your product have to be excellent , but you also have to be_able to collect . '' other manufacturers are equally cautious . bud konheim , president of nicole miller inc. , says_0 his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the federated and allied chains . this limits his financial exposure , he_says 0 . `` the branches are just warmed over , empty halls , ''_says mr. konheim . `` why_should i be part_of that problem ? i_'ve got limited production , and i_ca n't give it to underperformers . '' campeau 's ms. sanger disputes mr. konheim 's comments . `` many of the branches are very lucrative , '' she_says . `` that 's just nonsense . '' as for mr. levy at st. gillian , he_says 0 he will maintain his credit lines with the various campeau stores unless_they miss a payment . `` if_they slip for 10_cents for 10_minutes , i_'ll stop , '' he_says .
