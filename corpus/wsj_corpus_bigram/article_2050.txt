intel_corp. 's most_powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer_makers ' marketing efforts , but the `` bugs '' are n't expected to hurt intel and most computer_makers . computer experts familiar_with the flaws , found in intel 's 80486 chip , say_0 the defects do_n't affect the average user and are_likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their `` brains '' appear on the market sometime_next year . intel said that last_week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's `` floating-point unit '' , a set of circuits that do certain calculations . on friday , intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations . but while international_business machines_corp. and compaq_computer corp. say_0 the bugs will delay products , most big computer_makers said_0 the flaws do_n't affect them . `` bugs like this are just a normal part_of product_development , '' said richard archuleta , director of hewlett-packard_co. 's advanced systems development . hewlett announced last_week that it planned to ship a computer based_on the 486 chip early_next year . `` these bugs do_n't affect our schedule at all , '' he said . likewise , ast research inc. and sun_microsystems inc. said_0 the bugs wo_n't delay their development of 486-based machines . ``_we have n't modified our schedules in any way , '' said a sun spokesman . to switch to another vendor 's chips , `` would definitely not be an_option , '' he said_0 . nonetheless , concern about the chip may_have been responsible_for a decline of 87.5_cents in intel 's stock to $_32 a_share yesterday in over-the-counter_trading , on volume of 3,609,800 shares , and partly responsible_for a drop in compaq 's stock in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading on wednesday . yesterday , compaq plunged further , closing at $_100 a_share , off $ 8.625 a_share , on volume of 2,633,700 shares . most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter_earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts_' expectations . intel said_0 it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next_week . ``_we should not be seeing any more , '' said bill rash , intel 's director for the 486 chip . what 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such_as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said_0 , and then very seldom . `` these errata do not affect business programs , '' he said . the bugs will cause problems in `` specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications '' such_as word-processing and spreadsheets , said_0 michael slater , editor of the microprocessor report , an industry newsletter . sun , hewlett-packard and others say_0 intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu . the real culprits , they said_0 , are computer_makers such_as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products . `` the reason 0 this is getting so_much visibility is that some started shipping and announced early availability , '' said hewlett-packard 's mr. archuleta . `` you_can do that but you_'re taking a risk . those companies are paying the price for taking the risk . '' in late_september , ibm began shipping a plug-in card that converts its ps\/2 model 70-a21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine . an ibm spokeswoman_said 0 the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product . ibm has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman_said 0 , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays . ``_we do_n't look_at this as a major problem for us , '' she said . compaq , which said_0 it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new 486 products on nov._6 . because of the glitch , however , the company said_0 it_does n't_know when its machine will_be commercially available . that 's a break from compaq tradition , because the company does_n't announce products until they_'re actually at the dealers . the problem is being ballyhooed , experts_say 0 , because the 486 is intel 's future flagship . intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal_computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next_generation of machines . `` although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon , the 486 is an extremely high-profile product , '' said mr. slater , the newsletter editor . intel 's 80486 chip is the corvette of intel 's microprocessors , a super-fast , super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are_likely to buy for at_least several_years . unveiled last_april , the chip crams 1.2_million transistors on a sliver of silicon , more_than four_times as many as on intel 's earlier model , 80386 . intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second , or mips . that 's four_times as fast as the 386 . machines using the 486 are_expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such_as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design . but while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling , it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance . the 486 is the descendant of a long series of intel chips that began dominating the market ever_since ibm picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal_computer . -lrb- a 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower_than newer , 32-bit chips . -rrb- since_then , intel has cornered a large part_of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models . that 's what will keep computer_makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs . big personal_computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are_expected to reach the market early_next year . of the big computer_makers , only apple_computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead . `` the 486 is going_to have a big impact_on the industry , '' said hewlett-packard 's mr. archuleta . `` it 's going_to be the leading edge technology in personal_computers for the next_few years . this bug is not_going to have any affect on that at all .
