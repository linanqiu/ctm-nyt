newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter_results , aided_by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage , especially in the northeast . adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have_been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry . in new_york , the bonwit_teller and b._altman &_co. department_stores have filed for protection_from creditors_under chapter_11 of the federal_bankruptcy code , while the r.h._macy &_co. , bloomingdale_'s and saks_fifth avenue department-store_chains are for sale . many papers throughout the country are also faced_with a slowdown in classified-ad spending , a booming category for newspapers in recent_years . until_recently , industry analysts believed 0 decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this_year 's third and fourth quarters . all bets are off , analysts_say 0 , because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains . `` improved paper prices will_help offset weakness in linage , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage 0 they usually run , '' said edward_j. atorino , industry_analyst for salomon_brothers inc . `` retailers are just in disarray . '' for_instance , gannett co. posted an 11_% gain in net_income , as total ad_pages dropped at usa_today , but advertising revenue_rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates . gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3_% increase in advertising and circulation revenue . total advertising linage was `` modestly '' lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad linage , said_0 john curley , gannett 's chief_executive officer . at usa_today , ad_pages totaled 785 for the quarter , down 9.2 % from the 1988_period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics . while usa_today 's total paid ad_pages for the year to date totaled 2,735 , a decrease of 4_% from last_year , the paper 's ad revenue_increased 8_% in the quarter and 13_% in the nine_months . in the nine_months , gannett 's net_rose 9.5_% to $ 270 million , or $ 1.68 a_share , from $ 247 million , or $ 1.52 a_share . revenue gained 6_% to $ 2.55 billion from $_2.4 billion . at dow_jones &_co. , third-quarter_net income_fell 9.9_% from the year-earlier_period . net_fell to $ 28.8 million , or 29 cents_a share , from $_32 million , or 33_cents a_share . the year-earlier_period included a one-time_gain of $ 3.5_million , or four cents_a share . revenue gained 5.3_% to $ 404.1 million from $ 383.8 million . the drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at the wall_street journal and barron_'s magazine . ad linage at the journal fell 6.1 % in the third_quarter . affiliated publications_inc. reversed a year-earlier third_quarter net_loss . the publisher of the boston globe reported_net of $ 8.5_million , or 12 cents_a share , compared_with a loss of $ 26.5 million , or 38_cents a_share , for the third_quarter in 1988 . william o. taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief_executive officer , said_0 earnings continued to be hurt_by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper . third-quarter_profit estimates for several companies are_being strongly affected_by the price of newsprint , which in the last two_years has had several price increases . after a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14_% since_1986 to $_650 a metric_ton , analysts are encouraged , because_they do_n't expect a price increase for the rest of this_year . companies with daily_newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage . mr. atorino at salomon_brothers said_0 he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third_quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its long island newsday and hartford courant newspapers . trouble on the east_coast was likely offset_by improved ad linage at the los_angeles times , which this_week also unveiled a redesign . new_york times co. is_expected to report lower earnings for the third_quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new_york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , forest_products group . `` times co. 's regional daily_newspapers are holding up well , but there_is little sign that things will improve in the new_york market , '' said alan kassan , an_analyst with shearson_lehman hutton . washington_post co. is_expected to report improved_earnings , largely_because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area . according_to analysts , profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek . the news-weekly has faced heightened competition_from rival time_magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market . knight-ridder inc. is faced_with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement_between its detroit free_press and gannett 's detroit news , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third_quarter . however , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily_newspapers , such_as the miami herald and san_jose mercury news . `` the miami market is coming_back strong after a tough couple of years '' when knight-ridder `` was starting up a hispanic edition and circulation was falling , '' said bruce thorp , an_analyst for provident national_bank .
