exxon_corp. filed_suit against the state of alaska , charging 0 state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last_spring 's giant oil_spill . the action is a counterclaim to a suit_filed by alaska in_august against exxon and six other oil_companies . the state 's suit alleges_that exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds_of miles of shoreline along prince william sound . that suit and exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state_court in anchorage . neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely_because damage assessment has n't_yet been completed . legal strategists say that damage_claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $_1 billion . litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag_on for years . exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part_of the cleanup_costs and damage_claims 0 it says_0 resulted_from the state 's conduct . the oil company claims that alaskan officials prevented exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran_into an underwater reef . craig tillery , an alaska assistant attorney_general , said in an_interview last_night that exxon 's accusations `` are not new . exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated 0 they_were untrue . the state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' since the spill last_march , exxon and the state have_been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would_have helped limit the environmental damage . exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part_of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two_days of fair weather following the spill . the oil company claims that it had permission from the u.s. environmental_protection agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the u.s. coast_guard . the state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , exxon says_0 , caused the coast_guard `` to delay granting permission . '' alaskan and coast_guard officials_say 0 exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two_days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said_0 .
