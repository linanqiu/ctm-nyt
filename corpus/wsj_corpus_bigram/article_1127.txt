national_geographic , the sixth-largest u.s. magazine , is attracting more readers than_ever and offers the glossy , high-toned pages that upscale advertisers love . so why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10_% and ad revenue by 7.2_% in the first_half ? to hear advertisers tell it , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third_world , it has n't been_able to shake its reputation_as a magazine 0 boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women . worse , it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks , from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers . but now , the magazine is attempting_to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad_campaign . advertisers do_n't think of the magazine first , says_0 joan mccraw , who joined in april as national advertising director . `` what we_want to do is take a more_aggressive stance . people did_n't believe_0 we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many_ways we were n't . '' the 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so_much fervor before . it largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : 10.8_million subscribers in the first_half , up from 10.5 million a year_ago ; an_average age of 42 for readers -- at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an 85_% average subscription renewal rate . the magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it celebrated its_centennial and racked_up a 17_% gain in ad_pages , to 283 . but this_year , when the hullabaloo surrounding its_centennial died , so too did some advertiser interest . the reason , ad executives_say 0 , is that the entire magazine business has_been soft -- and national_geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market . perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ 130,000 for a four-color page , vs. $ 47,000 for the smithsonian , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation . when ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all . even_though national_geographic offers far_more readers than does a magazine like smithsonian , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , ''_says 0 harry glass , new_york media manager for bozell inc . to combat that problem , national_geographic , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion_of its magazines -- for_example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets . but the magazine was slower_than its competitors to come_up with its regional editions , and until last_year offered fewer of them than did competitors . time_magazine , for_example , has more_than 100 separate editions going_to different regions , top_management , and other groups . another sticking point for advertisers was national_geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather_than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do . and national_geographic 's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers . but ms. mccraw says_0 the magazine is fighting back . it now offers 30 regional editions , it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles , and it has_been beefing up its sales_force . and it just launched a promotional campaign 0 to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that . the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad_campaign , into which the magazine will pour about $_500,000 , mostly in the next_few weeks . the campaign , created_by omnicom group 's ddb_needham agency , takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that national_geographic is known for . in one ad , a photo of the interior of the sainte-chapelle in paris is paired with the headline , `` the only book more respected than ours does_n't accept advertising . '' another ad pictures a tree ant , magnified 80 times , with the headline , `` for impact far_beyond your size consider our regional editions . '' ms. mccraw says_0 she_wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in 10 categories , including corporate , financial_services , consumer_electronics , insurance and food . her goal : to top 300 ad_pages in 1990 , up from about 274 this_year . whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain . `` the ad_campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of national_geographic , '' she_says . ``_we want it to be a '90s kind_of image . '' wcrs plans ad-unit sale wcrs group hopes to announce , perhaps today , an_agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to paris-based eurocom , a european ad executive said_0 . wcrs has_been in discussions_with eurocom for several_months . however , when negotiations bogged down recently , wcrs 's chief_executive , peter scott , met in paris with another french firm , boulet dru dupuy petit , or bddp . according_to the executive , bddp 's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the wcrs-eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping to hammer out details by today . executives of the two agencies could_n't be_reached last_night . ad_notes ... . new account : procter_& gamble_co. , cincinnati , awarded the ad accounts for its line of professional crisco vegetable shortening and oil products to northlich , stolley , lawarre , cincinnati . billings were n't_disclosed . professional crisco products are specially made for the foodservice industry . who 's news : stephen novick , 49 , was_named executive_vice president , deputy creative director at grey advertising , new_york . he was executive_vice president , director of broadcast production .
