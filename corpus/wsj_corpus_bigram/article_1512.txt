time_warner inc. and sony_corp. may_be today 's public enemies , but the two entertainment giants could end_up becoming partners in a number_of ventures as_part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute_over hollywood producers peter_guber and jon_peters . the warner bros. studio and sony signaled 0 they_are close to a settlement yesterday , asking a los_angeles superior court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on warner 's_request for a preliminary_injunction blocking mr._guber and mr._peters from taking the top posts at columbia_pictures entertainment inc . in separate statements , the two_sides said_0 they_want to have `` further discussions . '' sony is acquiring columbia and guber-peters entertainment_co. in two_separate transactions valued_at more_than $_5 billion . warner_communications inc. , which is being_acquired by time_warner , has filed a $_1 billion breach-of-contract suit_against sony and the two producers . warner has a five-year exclusive contract with mr._guber and mr._peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the warner bros. studio . the two_sides in the legal_battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each_other for weeks , and both warner and sony have accused each_other of trying_to sabotage each_other 's prospects_for success in the entertainment business . but it may amount to little more_than posturing ; the two have continued on-again , off-again settlement_talks over the last few_weeks , and people_familiar with the talks say_0 the matter could_be resolved within a week . both warner and sony declined to comment_on the terms of the settlement discussions . but the people_familiar with the talks said that warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement . instead , sony is_likely to agree to let warner participate_in certain of its businesses , such_as the record club of sony 's cbs_records unit . warner has surpassed sony as the largest record company , but it_does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like cbs . the two_sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to columbia 's movies . in_addition , sony is_expected to agree to swap columbia 's 35_% stake_in the sprawling burbank , calif. , studio that warner and columbia share , in exchange for the old mgm studio lot that warner acquired with the purchase of lorimar telepictures corp . still , it may_be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake_of sworn affidavits filed over the last_week . one , for_example , came from cbs_records chairman walter yetnikoff , who will head a committee that will oversee sony 's entertainment division , including both records and movies . in his_affidavit , mr. yetnikoff accused warner chairman steven j. ross of having an `` antisony , anti-japanese bias '' and said that mr._ross had tried_to talk him out of letting sony buy cbs_records two_years ago for that reason . mr._ross , who will_be chairman and co-chief_executive officer of time_warner after the merger is complete , denied that in his_own affidavit , and called mr. yetnikoff 's remarks `` vicious '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and baseless , '' saying_0 warner under his leadership has started a number_of businesses in japan . mr._ross also said_0 he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with japanese executives including sony chairman akio morita , `` who has visited my home here . '' but despite the acrimony between mr._ross and mr. yetnikoff , officials of the time side of time_warner have reportedly been increasingly interested_in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities . time executives such_as the company 's president , n.j . nicholas , who will eventually be co-chief_executive of time_warner alongside mr._ross , have no personal relationships or ego at stake_in the fight over the guber-peters duo , and were never directly drawn_into the fray . talks_between the two_sides could unravel , of course , as they have more_than once since sony announced its plans to hire mr._guber and mr._peters . but both_sides appear to be more willing now to meet each_other 's terms to resolve the issue . and although warner has said_0 it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract , the producers said in sworn court declarations that they_did n't_believe 0 the relationship could_be repaired after the acrimony of the legal_battle . any settlement is also expected to exclude mr._guber and mr._peters from any of the projects 0 they_were working on at warner . the guber-peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at warner , including `` bonfire of the vanities '' and `` a bright shining lie . '' but that does_n't mean_0 mr._guber and mr._peters might_not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; studios develop hundreds_of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year . once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , producers are typically free to take it elsewhere . mr._guber and mr._peters also almost_certainly would n't be_able to participate_in future sequels to ``_batman , '' the blockbuster hit 0 they produced for warner . but in acquiring guber-peters entertainment , sony will actually get a piece of the profits from ``_batman , '' since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies 0 mr._guber and mr._peters produce . the two producers own a combined 28_% stake_in guber-peters .
