in this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a_lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space . so can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ? garbage magazine , billed as `` the practical journal for the environment , '' is about to find_out 0 . founded by brooklyn , n.y. , publishing entrepreneur patricia poore , garbage made its debut this_fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the u.s. waste crisis . the magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what_happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders . garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate_america 's good guys and bad boys . in one feature , called `` in the dumpster , '' editors point_out a product 0 they deem to be a particularly bad offender . from an advertising standpoint , the problem is 0 these offenders are_likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these_days . with only two issues under its belt , garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others . campbell_soup , for one , is furious 0 its souper combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` in the dumpster '' column . the magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items 0 they say_0 are non-biodegradable . `` it 's precisely the kind_of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster , '' the editors wrote . ``_i think that this magazine is not_only called garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for campbell_soup . he_says 0 campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment . modifications had_been made to the souper combo product at the time 0 the issue was printed , he_says 0 , making it less an offender than was portrayed . he admits , though , 0 it is n't one of campbell_soup 's better products in terms of recyclability . campbell_soup , not surprisingly , does_n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine , according_to its spokesman . some media experts question_whether a young magazine can risk turning off madison avenue 's big spenders . `` you really need the campbell soups of the world to be interested_in your magazine if_you 're_going to make a run of it , ''_says mike white , senior_vice president and media director at ddb_needham , chicago . `` the economics of magazine publishing pretty_much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big-time ad spenders , he_adds 0 . the first two issues featured ads from only a_handful of big advertisers , including general_electric and adolph coors , but the majority were from companies like waste management_inc. and bumkins international , firms that do_n't spend much money advertising and ca_n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long_haul . a waste management spokeswoman says_0 its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and 0 it_does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues . ``_we do_n't spend much on print advertising , '' she_says . but ms. poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends_0 garbage can survive , at_least initially , on subscription revenues . individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 . -lrb- it is , of course , printed on recycled paper . -rrb- according_to ms. poore , old-house journal corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue . the first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she_says 0 , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions . asked_whether potential advertisers will_be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , ms. poore replies : ``_i do_n't know and i_do n't care . i_'m not saying_0 advertising revenue is n't important , '' she_says 0 , `` but i could_n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because_they once took out an ad . ad_notes ... . interpublic on tv : interpublic_group said_0 its television
