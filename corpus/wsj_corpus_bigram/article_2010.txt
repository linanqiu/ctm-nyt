general_motors corp. wants to buy as_much as 15_% of jaguar_plc , marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against ford_motor co. for control of the british car_maker . gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last_week to purchase more_than $ 15 million worth of jaguar_shares but does_n't own any yet , according_to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters . the no._1 u.s._auto maker then wrote jaguar that it_intends `` to go to that 15_% '' level once it wins the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ 15 million , a jaguar spokesman_said 0 yesterday . the gm move follows tuesday 's declaration by ford , which_holds an unwelcome 12.45 %_stake in jaguar , that it is prepared to bid for the entire company . gm is close to completing a friendly deal_with jaguar that is_likely to involve an eventual 30_% stake and joint manufacturing ventures . speculative investors , betting on an_imminent clash between ford and gm , pushed_up jaguar 's share price five pence_-lrb- eight u.s. cents -rrb- to a near-record 720 pence_-lrb- $ 11.60 -rrb- in late trading on london 's stock_exchange yesterday . since tuesday , the shares have gained nearly 4_% . but an all-out bidding_war between the world 's top auto_giants for britain_'s leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely . ``_we will not go over a certain level , '' said david n. mccammon , ford 's vice_president for finance , at a news_conference yesterday in dearborn , mich . `` there 's some price at which we_'d stop bidding . '' he would n't_specify what it was . and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to_keep its so-called golden_share , which limits any individual holding to 15_% , until the restriction expires on dec._31 , 1990 . ``_i really do_n't see the government doing something that jaguar does_n't want over the next 14 months , '' said kenneth warren , a conservative member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on trade and industry in britain_'s house of commons . `` the golden_share is a single share , but it is the magic share . '' the government retained the single share after selling its stake_in jaguar in 1984 -- part_of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization . the 15_% restriction covers any would-be suitor , british or foreign . ford is willing_to bid for 100 % of jaguar 's shares if both the government and jaguar_shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely . as jaguar 's_biggest holder and britain_'s biggest car_maker , ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders_' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early . ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional_investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties . the government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile foray by ford , however . it has relinquished a golden_share only once before -- during british_petroleum co. 's # 2.5_billion -lrb- $_4 billion -rrb- takeover of britoil plc in 1988 . in wooing british lawmakers , gm has pointed_out that its willingness to_settle for a minority_stake would keep jaguar british-owned and independent . this_week , the u.s._auto giant paid for 10 house of commons members and two house of lords members to fly to detroit and tour its operations there . while the visit was unrelated to jaguar , gm chairman roger smith answered the legislators ' questions_about it over lunch tuesday . he said_0 jaguar `` should n't be smothered by anyone_else , '' recalled 0 one participant . politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction . the conservatives do_n't dare jeopardize marginal tory seats in coventry , where jaguar has headquarters , nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of britain_'s water and electricity industries . prime_minister margaret_thatcher might , however , be receptive to any request by jaguar chairman sir_john egan for the restriction 's early removal to let gm amass more_than 15_% or mount a friendly suitor bid against ford . in the end , sir_john -- rather_than the government or jaguar_shareholders -- may hold the key that unlocks the golden_share .
