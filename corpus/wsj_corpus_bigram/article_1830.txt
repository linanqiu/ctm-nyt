polly_peck international_inc. 's agreement to_acquire 51_% of sansui electric_co. proves that foreign companies can acquire japanese_companies -- if the alternative for the japanese company is extinction . polly_peck , a fast-growing british conglomerate , will pay 15.6_billion yen_-lrb- $_110 million -rrb- for 39 million new shares of sansui , a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market_conditions . japanese government_officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof 0 foreigners can make similar investments in japan . polly_peck 's chairman , asil nadir , echoed the official japanese view of the accord , which was announced friday . `` the myths that japan is not open to concerns from outside has , i_think 0 , been demolished at a stroke , '' mr. nadir said . but analysts_say 0 sansui is a special case . it_expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion_yen for the year_ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion_yen . `` if_you find sound , healthy companies in japan , they_are not for sale , '' said george watanabe , a management-consultant at tokyo-based asia advisory services_inc . statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike sansui , which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock_exchanges , most of the japanese_companies acquired by foreigners are privately held . but by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful_of japanese_companies this_year , while japanese_companies have acquired hundreds_of foreign companies . nor do analysts_expect the sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases . if the strong yen and the high stock_prices of japanese_companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly japanese_companies and fiercely independent japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers . usually when a japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of sansui 's directors at a joint news_conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour . sansui was once one of japan 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles . but in recent_years , the market has moved toward less_expensive `` mini-component '' sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could_be stacked on top of each_other . some of sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such_as aiwa co. and pioneer electric corp. , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their_own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players . sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses . as the yen soared in recent_years , sansui 's deepening financial_problems became a vicious circle . while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories , sansui lacked the money 0 to build new plants in southeast_asia . `` our company has not been_able to cope very effectively with '' changes in the marketplace , said ryosuke ito , sansui 's president . but even a japanese company that looks_like a dog may turn_out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain 0 . yoshihisa murasawa , a management consultant for booz-allen & hamilton -lrb-_japan -rrb- inc. , said_0 his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese_companies more often to foreign clients in the future . `` attitudes -lcb- toward being_acquired -rcb- are still negative , but they_'re becoming_more positive , '' mr. murasawa said . `` in some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make_sense . '' whether polly_peck 's acquisition makes_sense remains to be seen , but at the news_conference , mr. nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn sansui around . sansui , he said_0 , is a perfect fit for polly_peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker '' basis for sale under other companies_' brand names . he said_0 polly_peck will greatly expand sansui 's product_line , using sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into polly_peck 's own factories . `` whatever capital it -lrb- sansui -rrb- needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will_be injected , '' mr. nadir said . and while polly_peck is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of sansui , it is bringing in a former toshiba_corp. executive as executive_vice president and chief_operating officer . such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash mr. nadir , who is 25_% owner of polly_peck as_well as its chairman . he took polly_peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base 0 to build a conglomerate that has_been doubling its profits annually since_1980 . in_september , it announced_plans to_acquire the tropical-fruit business of rjr_nabisco inc. 's del monte foods unit for # 557 million -lrb- $ 878 million -rrb- . last_month , polly_peck posted a 38 %_jump in pretax_profit for the first_half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 %_rise in sales . joann s. lublin in london contributed_to this_article .
