two old friends , george_bush and deng xiaoping , are trying_to limit further damage to u.s.-china ties . but as congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions_against beijing , the already-tense relationship could_get worse . the problem for congress will_be to weigh what china is saying to its people against the more conciliatory message 0 it is delivering to the bush_administration . in a move apparently aimed_at heading off new punitive legislation , mr. deng sent an indirect signal to washington via t.d. lee , a columbia_university physicist who met mr. deng and other chinese_leaders in beijing last_month . when he met_with mr._bush on his return , mr._lee says_0 , he told the president that the chinese `` made statements to me that i regard as a first_step toward reconciliation . '' the communication 0 mr._lee brought represents the softer line 0 the u.s. has_been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june_4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing . the chinese leader , mr._lee informed mr._bush 0 , expressed some regret for what had happened in beijing and conceded_that china_'s officials bore some responsibility . mr._lee says_0 mr. deng told_him : ``_we should not mind those_who participated in demonstrations , signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes . '' mr. deng added , says_0 mr._lee , that ``_we really made mistakes . we_must not shirk our responsibility and we_can not just blame the demonstrators . '' mr._lee also reported to the president that , in a separate meeting , communist_party chief jiang zemin said_0 the chinese leadership `` looked kindly on the students who_took part in the demonstrations . '' mr. jiang also pledged that the chinese red_cross would publish `` very soon '' a list of those killed . and he told the physicist that china_'s leaders were `` very_much concerned '' about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families . ``_i transmitted my conversations to the white_house , '' prof. lee says . but , he_adds , ``_i was not acting as a messenger . '' he_says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president_bush , but that the white_house spontaneously invited him to do_so . mr._lee concedes 0 the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in china , but attributes that to the fact_that the situation in china is `` very complex . '' according_to u.s. sources in beijing , the administration hopes 0 mr. deng 's fairly conciliatory comments will prod congress to be cautious_about further sanctions_against beijing . `` the president does_n't want to have legislative sanctions , ''_says a u.s. official . `` but he may_not have a choice . '' given china_'s far-from-conciliatory statements to its_own people , mr._bush may_be unable_to prevent new sanctions . beijing officials have said_0 they will step_up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those_who participated in the demonstrations . sentences have_been stiff . a university student got eight_years for participating in the rallies , sources in beijing said_0 , while an 18-year-old worker got 10_years . nor has beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed . so_far , the victims are officially considered evil-doers , and their_families receive no compensation . a man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries , after his death , the official stigma of `` counterrevolutionary , '' his_wife says_0 . what 's more , much of china_'s official rhetoric is hostile to the u.s. . china frequently lambastes the u.s._embassy for harboring astrophysicist fang lizhi , a political dissident who_took refuge there after the massacre . `` in the u.s. , there_are still people_who want to crush china and interfere in our internal affairs , '' zhu qizhen , china_'s new ambassador to the u.s. , said as he left for washington last_week . the house and senate are to begin soon hashing out an_agreement for sanctions legislation . it will_probably be attached to a state_department authorization bill , which mr._bush is n't expected to veto . a congressional staffer involved in drafting the sanctions says_0 they_are likely_to mirror those 0 mr._bush enacted shortly_after the massacre . but as legislative action , they would carry greater weight and would_be more_difficult 0 to rescind . measures already in effect that are_expected to be made law include a ban_on military sales and exchanges , a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to u.s._trade enhancement programs , such_as the overseas private investment corp. and the trade development program . codifying those sanctions could prompt chinese retaliation . `` if the two_sides are n't careful , u.s.-china ties could spin downward , out of control , ''_says a u.s. official in beijing . `` bush and deng are hoping -lcb- that -rcb- cooler heads prevail .
