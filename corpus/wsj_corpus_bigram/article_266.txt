the dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope 0 will jolt the u.s. unit out of its narrow ranges . the canadian dollar climbed to its highest_level against the u.s. dollar since late august , prompting the bank of canada to sell the canadian currency on the market . traders_say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on_wall street , the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new u.s. economic_data . they noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the dow_jones industrial_average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day . in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8470_marks , down from 1.8578 marks_late friday , and at 141.90_yen , down from 142.43 yen_late friday . sterling was_quoted at $ 1.6030 , up from $ 1.5885 late_friday . in tokyo tuesday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen , down from monday 's tokyo_close of 142.40 yen . the market 's attention is especially focused_on a preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross_national product , due out thursday , which could show 0 the economy is continuing to_expand at a relatively brisk pace . the consensus view on real_gnp , the total_value of the u.s. output of goods and services adjusted_for inflation , calls_for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second_quarter 's 2.5_% , but still fairly strong . few market_participants expect the u.s. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns_out as expected . many contend_that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict 0 the third-quarter figures may_be the last vigorous statistics for some time 0 to come . `` everyone is waiting_for gnp , ''_says walter simon , an assistant treasurer with bank julius baer &_co . `` yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9_% -- wo_n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . '' hubert pedroli , managing_director of foreign_exchange at credit_suisse in new_york , adds , `` the market sees this as the last piece of good_news . '' mr. pedroli notes that the gnp deflator , a measure of inflation , is_expected to slow , which would_give the federal_reserve more room 0 to ease key_u.s. rates . analysts_predict a 3.5_% rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6_% in the second_quarter . they note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the u.s._trade gap in_august was reported earlier_this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade_deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the u.s._economy was losing its momentum . a 190-point_plunge in u.s. stock shares compounded the view , they say_0 . `` everyone is extremely convinced 0 the economy is slowing , ''_says one senior new_york dealer . `` if we_'re not headed for a recession , we_'re certainly headed for a major slowdown . '' while the market expects little reaction from news of u.s. durable_goods orders , scheduled for release today , participants note that the figures will_probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment . u.s. durable_goods orders are_expected to show a decline of 1.2_% in_september , according_to economists . the anticipated drop follows a 3.9_% rise in_august . traders , however , are quick to point_out that while there_is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the u.s. unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140_yen . its resilience around these levels is pegged to persistent investor_demand for the greenback , especially in japan . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery settled_at $ 367 an_ounce , down 30 cents . estimated_volume was a very light one million_ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong tuesday , gold was_quoted at $ 366.79 an_ounce .
