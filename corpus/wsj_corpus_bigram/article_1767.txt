like so_many trends in the entertainment industry , the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest . the former comes from the latest wave of political activism in hollywood , especially around feminist issues such_as abortion . the latter comes from the perception , on the part_of many_people in network tv , that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism . put these together , and you_get programs about rape . the best of the crop was last_week 's season premiere of `` in the heat of the night , '' the nbc series based_on a 1967 feature film about a black philadelphia police detective in a small southern town . in the series , virgil tibbs -lrb- howard rollins -rrb- and his_wife , althea -lrb- anne-marie johnson -rrb- have settled in sparta , miss . because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in georgia , this episode -- in which althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime . obviously , it 's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot tv movie . but tonight 's offering , `` settle the score '' -lrb- 9-11 p.m._est , on nbc -rrb- , does_n't even try . this tale of a chicago policewoman returning home to find the man_who raped her 20_years earlier is supposed_to be set in the ozarks . but it 's more like an illustration of what ben stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the tv industry : `` fear of violence and animosity ... because of race or religion , fear and lack_of comprehension about the politics of small-town people ... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of tv writers and producers . '' the writer and executive producer of `` settle the score , '' steve sohmer , is a graduate of yale who_participated in a pbs documentary , aired this_summer , in which six members of the yale class of 1963 ruminated about their_lives since graduation . at one_point in the documentary , mr._sohmer , who is jewish , says_0 he felt rejected by many of the protestants and southerners 0 he met at yale . he quotes one student saying , `` you_'re just the kind_of jewboy 0 we southerners ca_n't stand . '' mr._sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now `` a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of america . '' but is exile in hollywood enough ? not to judge by `` settle the score , '' in which mr._sohmer seems to be settling a score of his_own . of all the unflattering portraits of small-town america 0 i_'ve seen on tv , this film is the most gratuitously nasty . the sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter kate -lrb- jaclyn smith -rrb- , and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk , a truly benighted pack of southern protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex . i mean , 0 these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty kate for the fact_that when she was a teen-ager , someone tied her hands behind her back , thrust her head into a gunny sack , brutally raped and beat her , and then left her to die in a cold-storage room . her pa -lrb- howard duff -rrb- is the kind_of guy_who , while saying grace at the supper table , pauses at the word `` sin '' and glares at the daughter 0 he has n't seen for two_decades , because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what_happened in the cold-storage room , and has_been indulging the same taste ever_since in the fleshpots of chicago . people like pa do exist , of course . but in mr._sohmer 's ozarks , he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg . every man 0 kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical , viciously patronizing , revoltingly lecherous , or all three . add the fact_that any one of them , including pa , could_be her attacker , and you have a setting that does_n't resemble small-town america , or even hollywood 's nightmare of small-town america , so_much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like margaret atwood 's `` the handmaid 's tale , '' 0 itself soon to be -lrb- you guessed it -rrb- a hollywood movie . there_are two exceptions : josh -lrb- jeffrey demunn -rrb- , the local doctor who has always loved kate ; and lincoln -lrb- richard masur -rrb- , kate 's simple-minded but affectionate brother . josh makes clumsy passes at kate when she 's seething with anger and fear , but we_know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil patriarchy . how could he be ? he 's the director of the local planned parenthood chapter . as for lincoln , if_you ca_n't guess why he 's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her , then i_'m not_going to tell_you . as for the women , they_'re pathetic . kate 's ma -lrb- louise latham -rrb- is a moral coward . her sister-in-law -lrb- amy wright -rrb- is a sniveling prude afraid that kate will seduce all the married men in town , including a particularly loathsome fellow named tucker , whose idea of fun is to leave his_wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns , while he bullies kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying_to break her ribs . at the very least , it would appear that sis is a poor judge of masculine charm . yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of `` settle the score . '' in the aforementioned episode of `` in the heat of the night , '' we saw althea being attacked , but we were n't invited to enjoy the spectacle . in mr._sohmer 's film , by_contrast , we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim , as the camera ogles kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape . at this point , the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy . take the scene in which kate stands naked by a lighted window , whispering to her hidden assailant , `` look all 0 you_want . starting tomorrow , i_'m stalking you . '' or the one in which she and josh are stranded in the city , and , after insisting on separate motel rooms , she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push-up bra . surely the question is obvious . with friends like mr._sohmer , do the feminists of hollywood need enemies ?
