ford_motor co. intensified its battle with general_motors corp. over jaguar_plc by saying_0 it is prepared to make a bid for all of the british auto_maker when restrictions_on its shareholding are lifted . the statement was part_of a ford filing with the u.s. securities and exchange_commission . ford did_n't say how_much it might offer for jaguar , or when . the british_government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more_than 15_% of the company 's shares without permission until_dec. 31 , but with its stake_in jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , ford could convene a special jaguar_shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner . a successful vote would put pressure_on the british_government to lift the restriction . ``_we have not made that decision '' to seek a jaguar special shareholders_' meeting , said_0 martyn watkins , a ford spokesman in london . he emphasized that the car_maker only would bid for all of jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . '' last_month , ford announced_plans to_acquire as_much as 15_% of jaguar . since_then , jaguar officials have confirmed_that they_are discussing an alliance_with gm and said last_week that they hoped to reach an_agreement within a month . analysts have_been expecting a gm-jaguar pact that would_give the u.s. car_maker an eventual 30_% stake_in the british company and create joint_ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars . but the specter of ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the gm-jaguar talks . jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving gm a minority_stake , said_0 one individual close to the talks , adding , `` it would n't surprise me if -lcb- jaguar executives -rcb- want to wait and see what the color of that -lcb- ford bid -rcb- is '' first . he predicted 0 ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next_week to outline their proposed offer . sir_john egan , jaguar 's chairman , so_far has refused_to meet with ford officials , but he is believed to be_willing to consider a specific bid proposal . as for gm , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said stephen reitman , european auto-industry analyst_at london brokers ubs-phillips &_drew . a ford takeover of jaguar would `` have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that general_motors ca_n't afford to step aside . they will have to throw their hat in the ring . '' a gm spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority_stake to help jaguar remain_independent . a pitched battle could mean_0 jaguar would fetch # 10 -lrb- $ 16.02 -rrb- a_share , or about # 1.8_billion -lrb- $ 2.88 billion -rrb- , several analysts_believe 0 . the prospect of such a takeover fight has sent jaguar_shares soaring in recent_weeks . u.s. takeover-stock speculators now own an_estimated 25_% of jaguar_shares . in a declining london stock_market yesterday , jaguar_shares were down four pence from monday in late trading , at 694 pence_-lrb- $ 11.11 -rrb- a_share . in the u.s. , jaguar 's american_depositary receipts rose 12.5_cents in over-the-counter_trading , to $ 11.25 . both ford and gm badly need a luxury brand 0 to combat new competition_from the japanese in the european and u.s. markets . and financially strapped jaguar has spent over a year looking_for a rich uncle 0 to provide cash and technological know-how . the company has expressed a preference for gm over ford because gm has promised 0 it would keep jaguar independent . ford 's need to_acquire some or all of jaguar became more acute last_week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its german-built merkur scorpio sedan as a european luxury import in the u.s. . then , last_friday , ford 's talks about a possible alliance_with saab-scania ab of sweden collapsed . gm 's interest in jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the u.s. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market . its opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks jaguar 's cachet . gm officials also see a_lot of potential in marrying jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of group lotus plc , a british engineering and specialty car_maker 0 gm bought in 1986 .
