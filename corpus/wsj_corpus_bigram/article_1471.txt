treasury undersecretary david mulford defended the treasury 's efforts this_fall to drive_down the value of the dollar , saying_0 it helped minimize damage from the 190-point_drop in the stock_market oct._13 . testifying before a house_subcommittee , mr._mulford said that if the treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in_september and early_october to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock_market might_have provoked a steep fall in the currency that might_have `` unhinged financial_markets . '' mr._mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said_0 intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial_markets and works better_than `` was recognized some time ago . '' differences_between the treasury and the federal_reserve on the usefulness of intervention 0 to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing . fed vice_chairman manuel johnson , who had dissented from the treasury 's policy , told lawmakers , ``_i became convinced about what looked to me like an_attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . '' intervention , he_added 0 , is useful only to smooth disorderly markets , not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value . rep._john lafalce -lrb-_d. , n.y . -rrb- said_0 mr._johnson refused_to testify jointly with mr._mulford and instead asked to appear after the treasury official had completed his testimony . a fed spokesman denied mr. lafalce 's statement . mr._mulford said_0 reports of tension_between the treasury and fed have_been exaggerated , insisting that they involved `` nuances . '' mr._johnson also said that `` in the scheme of things , these_things are minor . '' on other matters , mr._mulford said_0 west_germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter . `` the solution is stronger domestic growth -lcb- in germany -rcb- , '' he said . but because the growth of the german economy has_been stronger than expected , mr._mulford said_0 , it 's difficult for the u.s. to argue_that germany ought_to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies . germany 's trade_surplus is largely with other european_countries rather_than with the u.s. , mr._mulford acknowledged 0 . but nonetheless u.s. companies might_be more successful in european markets if not for the german export push , he said_0 .
