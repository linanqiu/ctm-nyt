an arbitrator awarded eastern_airlines pilots between $ 60 million and $_100 million in back pay , a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization . eastern , a unit of texas_air corp. , said_0 it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal . it 's unclear whether eastern will_succeed in overturning the arbitrator 's decision , made in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predates both the carrier 's chapter_11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by texas_air . all eastern 's previous court efforts to head_off the pilots_' demands have failed . an eastern spokesman_said 0 he does_n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect_on the company 's strategic plan . '' bankruptcy experts said_0 the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim . that may leave a_lot of leeway 0 for u.s._bankruptcy judge burton r. lifland to decide_what , if anything , the pilots actually collect . in_august , he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator . the pilots_' contract with eastern calls_for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances . in a statement to employees , eastern said_0 the company was disappointed by the ruling . `` the obligation is totally unwarranted , '' the statement said . james linsey , a lawyer for the air line pilots association , said_0 the pilots were extremely pleased . `` this is a blow not_only to eastern but to the creditors_committee , '' he said . eastern 's creditors_committee , along_with the company , has consistently opposed the pilots_' claim , which if paid would_have to come_out of money 0 both hope to use to pay_off other bankruptcy claims . eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization_plan to pay_off the airline 's debts . an earlier plan , which had_received the creditors_' approval in july , fell apart when eastern changed its business plan . it is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan . the dispute_between eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots_' contract . the clause was part_of an_agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise . shortly_after texas_air took_control of eastern , some machinists_union supervisors received a 20_% pay raise . the pilots argued_that this triggered a pay raise for them . eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal_district court , an appeals_court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots . the two_sides do_n't even agree about how_much money is at issue . the pilots put the amount as high as $_100 million , the company at $ 65 million . another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between eastern and its pilots , resulting_from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union . a decision on that case is n't expected before mid-november . ironically , many of the pilots involved have left eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy_protection march 9 . about 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work .
