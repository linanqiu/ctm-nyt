in search of buyers for upscale department-store_chains such_as bloomingdale_'s and saks_fifth avenue , investment_bankers are turning to -- who else ? the japanese . but so_far japan 's cash-rich retailers are proving to be cautious shoppers . ``_we have the money 0 to buy . but operating a u.s. department-store chain would_be very_difficult , ''_says motoyuki homma , managing_director of the international division at mitsukoshi ltd. , one of japan 's leading department_stores . japanese retail executives_say the main_reason 0 they_are reluctant_to jump into the fray in the u.s. is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles . the japanese have watched the europeans and canadians stumble in the u.s. market , and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home wo_n't translate_into success in the u.s. . japanese department_stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity . after sony_corp. 's recent headline-grabbing acquisition of columbia_pictures , many say_0 it makes good political sense to lie low . `` it 's a question of timing , ''_says mayumi takayama , managing_director of international operations at isetan co. , a tokyo department_store . still , for those with a long-term eye on the vast u.s. retail market , this is a tempting time 0 to look for bargains . britain_'s b.a.t_industries plc is trying_to unwind its u.s._retailing operations , which include such well-known stores as saks_fifth avenue , marshall_field 's , breuners and ivey 's . and debt-ridden campeau_corp. of toronto is giving_up the 17-store bloomingdale_'s group . `` every department_store in japan is taking a look , ''_says mike allen , a retail analyst_at barclay 's de_zoete wedd securities -lrb-_japan -rrb-_ltd . mr._allen , however , does_n't think that japan is about to embark on a major buying binge . nonetheless , speculation heated up yesterday when tokyu department_store co. confirmed a report in nihon keizai shimbun , japan 's leading business daily , that tokyu is talking with campeau about buying bloomingdale_'s . tokyu , however , said_0 no agreement had_been reached . nor is tokyu the only japanese retailer interested_in bloomingdale_'s , which bankers in tokyo estimate 0 could cost between $_1 billion and $_1.5 billion . seven japanese department-store groups were approached by investment_bankers representing bloomingdale_'s chairman , marvin traub , and more_than half are seeking additional_information on the group , bankers_say 0 . what mr. traub is hoping to put_together , investment_bankers say , is a management-led group 0 to buy the new_york department-store group that he heads from campeau 's federated department_stores subsidiary . federated ran_into a cash_crunch after it was acquired last_year by campeau , which relied heavily_on debt to finance the transaction . paying off that debt put such a squeeze on campeau and its stores that federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire , including bloomingdale_'s . hoping to_avoid another takeover , mr. traub retained blackstone group and drexel_burnham lambert_inc. to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out . ideally , investment_bankers say_0 , he_wants to get backing from a japanese department_store and a european department_store 0 to forge a global retailing network . `` when_you look_at the economics , traub needs a japanese and a european partner to make it work , ''_says one investment_banker who_follows the retail industry . `` looking only at a narrow american strategy is n't where it 's at . '' persuading tradition-bound japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the u.s._retailing industry is n't likely_to be so easy , analysts_say 0 . up until_now , most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy : first they set_up overseas merchandising offices 0 to import items and track new fashion trends . then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed_at japanese tourists . reluctant_to advance further on their_own , some stores have settled for tie-ups with famous specialty shops . last_march , isetan invested 1.5_billion yen_-lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- in a venture with barney 's inc. , an up-scale new_york specialty clothier . the first barney 's shop is_scheduled to open in japan next_year . and mitsukoshi recently increased its equity_stake in tiffany &_co. to 13_% . through the longstanding relationship_between the two_companies , mitsukoshi has opened 22 tiffany shops in its stores and arcades in japan . plans are under_way to open a tiffany 's in hawaii 0 to cater to japanese tourists ; it will_be run mostly by mitsukoshi . some industry_observers say that mitsukoshi 's classy image makes it a possible match for saks_fifth avenue . company officials_say 0 they_are studying various proposals but wo_n't discuss details . takashimaya co. , japan 's oldest department_store , is another name that keeps popping up as a potential fit with saks . eiji nakazato , a takashimaya general_manager , admits that his company 's image is similar to saks 's and that there_is some interest in the idea . but he stops there . ``_we 'd_like to do business in america , '' he_says . `` but it looks tough .
