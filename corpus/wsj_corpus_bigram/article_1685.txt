the supreme_court agreed_to decide_whether the federal pension benefit guaranty corp. may require ltv corp. to reassume funding responsibility_for a $_2.3 billion shortfall in the company 's pension_plans . the high_court 's decision , expected next_spring , may affect the stability of many large corporate pension_plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency . the agency , which is funded through insurance premiums from employers , insures pension benefits for some 30 million private-sector workers who take part in single-employer pension_plans . it recently reported assets of $_2.4 billion and liabilities of $_4 billion . in its appeal to the high_court , the agency said the federal_appeals court_ruling , which favored ltv , threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension_plans into an `` open-ended source of industry bailouts . '' the ruling also may determine how quickly ltv is able_to complete its chapter_11 reorganization . ltv filed for protection_under chapter_11 in federal_bankruptcy court in 1986 . the filing was partly the result of the $_2.3 billion shortfall in ltv 's three pension_plans operated for its ltv steel co. subsidiary 's employees . in january_1987 , as ltv steel continued operating while under reorganization , the agency terminated the three ltv pension_plans to_keep its insurance liability from increasing . termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans , but workers do_n't accrue new benefits . a few_months later , under_pressure from the united_steelworkers of america , ltv instituted a new program 0 to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans . because the federal pension agency had taken_over the old plans , ltv would_be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension_plans . but the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an_attempt to transfer the liability of the $_2.3 billion shortfall from ltv to federal insurance . the agency also concluded_that ltv 's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization . in_september 1987 , it ordered ltv to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans . ltv challenged the order , and a federal_district court in new_york in june 1988 ruled_that the agency improperly ordered ltv to reassume responsibility_for the plans . in may , a federal_appeals court in new_york agreed that the agency acted unlawfully . the appeals_court said_0 there was no_evidence that congress intended_to allow the pension agency to consider a company 's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans . the appeals_court also said_0 the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability_to fund pension_plans , not just short-term improved financial status . in dallas , ltv said that it was disappointed that the court agreed_to hear the case because it believes_0 the move will further delay its chapter_11 proceedings . the company has n't been_able to come_up with a reorganization_plan , in part , because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency . but ltv , a steel , aerospace and energy concern , said_0 it is confident_that the supreme_court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said_0 it_expects to continue discussions_with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed . -lrb- pension benefit guaranty corp. vs. ltv corp .
