the u.s. and soviet_union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ 188 million in pre-communist russian debts owed to the u.s. government , the state_department said_0 . if the debts are repaid , it could clear the way_0 for soviet bonds to be_sold in the u.s. . however , after two meetings with the soviets , a state_department spokesman_said that it 's `` too_early to say '' whether that will happen . coincident with the talks , the state_department said_0 it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new_york branch . the branch of the bank for foreign economic_affairs was approved last_spring and opened in july . but a soviet bank here would_be crippled unless moscow found a way_0 to_settle the $ 188 million debt , which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic kerensky government before the communists seized power in 1917 . under a 1934 law , the johnson debt default act , as amended , it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government , unless_they are members of the world bank and international_monetary fund . the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization . moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other_countries in recent_years at less_than face_value . the state_department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act . but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds_of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world_war ii lend-lease program .
