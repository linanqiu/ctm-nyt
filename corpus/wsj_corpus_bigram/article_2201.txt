troubled sci television inc. proposed to restructure much of its $_1.3 billion in debt to buy time 0 to sell assets and pay its obligations . the leveraged_buy-out firm of kohlberg_kravis roberts &_co. , which_owns 46_% of the common equity of sci_tv , indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce_its equity_stake to 15_% , giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring . kkr also signaled to the company 's creditors that henry kravis and other kkr directors of sci_tv would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting_rights . holders of sci_tv 's $ 507 million of high-yield_junk bonds are_being asked to forgive a_lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39 % equity_stake in sci_tv . they immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said_0 the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems . ``_i think_0 the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number_of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will_be required to get it done , ''_says analyst craig davis of r.d. smith &_co. here . investors interpreted the kkr move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of sci_tv . but a spokesman for kkr says that with only a 15_% equity_stake , it would n't be appropriate for kkr to_keep board representation . kkr already_has made about $_1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with sci_tv , thus it is n't significantly affected_by the company 's troubles . sci_tv , which is controlled_by nashville , tenn. , entrepreneur george gillett , owns six tv_stations , including several cbs_inc. affiliates . it is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged_buy-out . through investment_banker drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , sci_tv is offering to exchange three classes of junk_bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar . kkr would_give up a 31 % equity_stake to bondholders , while mr._gillett would surrender an 8_% stake . while one big sci_tv investor thinks_0 that 's pretty generous , many junkholders had_been hoping that kkr and mr._gillett would invest new money in sci_tv . those investors think_0 sci_tv needs new equity to survive . sci_tv 's debt restructuring_plan would defer payment of $ 153 million of bank_debt . it also would defer interest and principal on junk_bonds that have_fallen due ; the grace period for paying the bill expires nov._16 . at the same_time , investors estimate 0 the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ 90 million to $ 85_million . yet to pay that interest bill , analysts_say 0 sci_tv will only produce about $ 80_million to $ 90 million of cash_flow a year .
