tandem_computers inc. , preparing to fight with international_business machines_corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said_0 it_expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal_fourth quarter_ended sept._30 . tandem said_0 it_expects to report revenue of about $_450 million and earnings of 35_cents to 40_cents a_share . the results , which are in line with analysts_' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our u.s. business , '' said_0 james treybig , tandem 's chief_executive officer . in the year-earlier_period , tandem reported_net income of $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents_a share , on revenue of $ 383.9 million . tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next_week . analysts have predicted that the cupertino , calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35_cents to 40_cents a_share . commenting_on the results for the quarter , mr. treybig said_0 the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , noting_that sales `` in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan . '' the company 's u.s. performance was helped by `` a record quarter for new customers , '' he said_0 . tandem makes `` fault-tolerant '' computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock_exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer_systems . tomorrow the company is_scheduled to announce its most_powerful computer ever , which for the first_time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe_computers . tandem 's new high-end computer is called cyclone . prices for the machine , which can come in various configurations , are $_2 million to $ 10 million . analysts_expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away_from ibm , the longtime leader in mainframes . ``_we believe_0 they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm '' over the next_few years , said_0 george weiss , an_analyst at the gartner group . that will spur tandem 's growth . ``_i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less_than 20_% next_year , '' said john levinson , an_analyst at goldman , sachs_& co . ibm is_expected to respond to tandem 's cyclone by discounting its_own mainframes , which analysts_say 0 are roughly three_times the price of a comparable system from tandem . ``_obviously ibm can give bigger discounts to users immediately , '' said mr. weiss . but mr. treybig questions whether that will_be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines . `` the answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , '' he said . nevertheless , tandem faces a variety_of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to ibm 's mainframes . even mr. treybig is reluctant_to abandon this notion , insisting that tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for ibm 's mainframes . ``_we 're after a little bigger niche , '' he said .
