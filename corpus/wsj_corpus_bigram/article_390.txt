philip_morris cos. , whose benson_& hedges cigarette brand has_been losing market share , has asked at_least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has_been at wells_rich greene inc. since 1966 . executives close to philip_morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked backer_spielvogel bates worldwide inc. , a unit of saatchi_& saatchi co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account . several executives said_0 another potential contender is wpp_group 's ogilvy_& mather agency , which works on some other philip_morris products . both philip_morris and backer_spielvogel declined to comment . a spokeswoman for ogilvy_& mather said_0 the agency does_n't comment_on `` idle speculation . '' also mentioned as a contender was tbwa advertising , but the company denied 0 it was participating . the loss of the cigarette account would_be a severe blow to wells_rich . benson_& hedges has_been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as_well as one of its largest clients . the account billed almost $ 60 million last_year , according_to leading national advertisers . but philip_morris has scaled_back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry_executives said_0 , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $_40 million . industry_executives said_0 philip_morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share . according_to john maxwell , an_analyst at wheat first securities , richmond , va. , benson_& hedges has slipped from 4.7_% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second_quarter of this_year . the brand is no. 7 overall in the cigarette business , mr. maxwell said_0 . the slip has come despite high-profile ads created_by wells_rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch . that ad generated so_much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing . wells_rich first popularized the benson_& hedges brand more_than 20_years ago with ads portraying , among_other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette . the brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some_analysts believe_0 is partly responsible_for its staid performance . philip_morris , trying_to revive the benson_& hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 . wells_rich greene , however , in an_effort directed by mary wells lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business . kenneth olshan , wells_rich 's chairman , did_n't return phone_calls seeking_comment . while wells_rich recently picked_up hertz_corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number_of big accounts this_year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million cadbury-schweppes canada dry and sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million procter_& gamble co . sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million polo\/ralph lauren business . its victories include more_than $ 30 million in sheraton corp. business and an assignment from dun_& bradstreet worth $_5 million to $ 10 million .
