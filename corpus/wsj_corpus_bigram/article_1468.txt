yields_on savings-type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week_ended yesterday . the average_yield on a six-month cd of $_50,000 or less was 7.90_% , compared_with 7.94 % a week earlier . the average one-year savings-type cd was down to 7.99 % from 8.01 % , according_to banxquote money markets , a new_york information service that tracks cd yields . `` this_week was uneventful for the cd market , '' said norberto mehl , chairman of banxquote . `` the major_banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month_treasury bill rates '' in the past_two weeks . banks that adjusted payouts on cds in the most_recent week made only fractional moves , he said_0 . the cd trend runs counter to the direction of short-term_interest rates at the treasury bill_auction monday . the average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04_% , up from 7.90_% . the average three-month issue rose to 8.05_% from 7.77 % . typically , banks offer cd yields higher_than those on treasury_bills , which are considered the safest short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products . but when market interest_rates move up rapidly , increases in bank cd yields sometimes lag . most yields_on short-term jumbo cds , those with denominations over $ 90,000 , also moved in the opposite direction of treasury bill yields . the average six-month yield on a jumbo cd was at 7.90_% , down from 7.93_% , banxquote said_0 . for longer-term cds , yields were up . the average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage_point to 7.91 % and 7.96_% , respectively . however , cds sold_through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board . the average six-month cd in that category added 0.05 percentage_point to 8.35_% , for_example . mr. mehl attributed the rise specifically to the treasury bill increase . among the major_banks surveyed by banxquote in six regions of the country , 8.33_% is the highest yield available . it is offered by the flagship banks of new_york 's manufacturers_hanover corp. in the one-year maturity only . the yield is offered across a range of maturities at san_francisco 's bankamerica_corp. and wells_fargo &_co . just two_weeks ago , bankamerica 's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61 % . still , on average , the major california banks have the highest yields_on cds , according_to banxquote . the average_yield there on_six-month issues is 8.32_% .
