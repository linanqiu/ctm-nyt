winnebago industries_inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter_loss and slashed its dividend in half . the forest city , iowa , maker of motor homes said_0 it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents_a share , in the quarter_ended aug. 26 . a year_earlier , the company had a deficit of $_1.5 million , or six cents_a share . the cut in the dividend to 10_cents a_share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me 0 they do_n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said_0 frank rolfes , an_analyst at dain bosworth inc. in minneapolis . indeed , winnebago said_0 it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail_sales in the fall and winter . the year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which_makes products such_as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . with the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . but the rate of the decline snowballed in_august , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year_earlier , according_to the recreation vehicle industry_association . at winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6_% to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year_earlier . the company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest_rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for rv buyers . `` it 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said robert curran , who_follows the industry for merrill_lynch &_co . `` so when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion_of the buying public to defer purchases . '' mr. curran expects industry rv sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5_% from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 . and he said_0 the weakness could continue in the first_half of next_year . but he said_0 the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby_boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying rvs . winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25_% industrywide in_august , and 10.4_% in the first_eight months of the year . the company said_0 it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among_other things . the news sent winnebago stock falling 62.5_cents , to $ 5.25 , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading - a 52-week low . the dividend cut will prove most costly for john k. hanson , winnebago 's founder and chairman . based_on his control of about 45_% of winnebago 's 24.7 million_shares , his annual dividend income would_be cut to about $_2.2 million from $ 4.4_million . for the year , winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7_million , or 19_cents a_share , following profit of $_2.7 million , or 11 cents_a share , a year_earlier . sales_rose 2_% to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million .
