kidder , peabody_& co. is trying_to struggle back . only a few_months ago , the 124-year-old securities_firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown , racked by internal squabbles and defections . its relationship_with parent general_electric co. had_been frayed since a big kidder insider-trading scandal two_years ago . chief executives and presidents had come and gone . now , the firm says_0 it 's at a turning point . by the end of this_year , 63-year-old chairman silas cathcart -- the former_chairman of illinois tool works who was derided as a `` tool-and-die man '' when ge brought him in to clean_up kidder in 1987 -- retires to his lake forest , ill. , home , possibly to build a shopping mall on some land 0 he owns . ``_i 've_done what i came to do '' at kidder , he_says 0 . and that means 0 42-year-old michael carpenter , president and chief_executive since_january , will for the first_time take complete control of kidder and try_to make good on some grandiose plans . mr._carpenter says_0 he will return kidder to prominence as a great investment_bank . wall_street is understandably skeptical . through the first_nine months of the year , kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of u.s. stocks and bonds , with a 2.8 % market share , up slightly from 2.5_% in the year-earlier_period , according_to securities data co . it 's quite a fall from the early_1980s , when kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse . gary s. goldstein , president of the whitney group , an executive search firm , said : ``_i 'd_like to see -lrb- kidder -rrb- succeed . but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one . '' in 1988 , kidder eked out a $ 46 million profit , mainly_because of severe cost cutting . its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an_estimated $_5 million loss last_year , although kidder expects it to turn a profit this_year . in fact , kidder is a minor player in just about every business 0 it_does except computer-driven_program trading ; in that controversial business , only morgan_stanley &_co. rivals kidder . but even that niche is under_attack , as several wall_street firms pulled_back from program_trading last_week under_pressure from big investors . mr._carpenter , a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for `` task forces , ''_says 0 he has done a `` complete rethink '' of kidder in recent_months . there have_been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations . more_than 20 new managing directors and senior_vice presidents have_been hired since_january . the firm 's brokerage force has_been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people . mr._carpenter says that when he assumes full control , kidder will finally tap the resources of ge . one of ge 's goals when it bought 80_% of kidder in 1986 was to take_advantage of `` syngeries '' between kidder and general_electric capital corp. , ge 's corporate-finance unit , which has $ 42 billion in assets . the leveraged_buy-out group of ge_capital now reports to mr._carpenter . so_far , instead of teaming up , ge_capital staffers and kidder investment_bankers have bickered . yet , says_0 mr._carpenter , ``_we 've really started to exploit the synergy between ge_capital and kidder_peabody . '' the units have worked on 37 investment_banking deals this_year , he_says 0 , though not all of them have panned out . ``_we 've_had a good relationship_with ge , which is the first_time 0 you could say that -- uh , let_me withdraw that . it 's been a steadily improving relationship , ''_says mr._carpenter . still , without many actual deals 0 to show off , kidder is left to stress that it finally has `` a team '' in place , and that everyone works harder . a month ago , the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night ; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment_banking operation have consistently been around that late . ``_we are working significantly longer and harder than has_been the case in the past , ''_says scott c. newquist , kidder 's head of investment_banking since_june . everywhere , kidder stresses the `` always working '' theme . a new in-house magazine , kidder world -- which will focus_on the firm 's synergy strategy , says_0 mr._carpenter -- confides that on weekends mr. newquist `` often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine cessna centurion on the way to nantucket . '' the firm 's new head of mergers and acquisitions under mr. newquist , b.j. megargel , talks of the opportunity to `` rebuild a franchise '' at kidder . `` the kidder name is one of only six or seven that every ceo recognizes as a viable alternative '' when considering a merger deal , he_says . now , according_to a kidder world story about mr. megargel , all 0 the firm has to do is `` position ourselves more in the deal flow . '' with investment_banking as kidder 's `` lead business , '' where do kidder 's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in ? mr._carpenter this_month sold_off kidder 's eight brokerage offices in florida and puerto_rico to merrill_lynch &_co. , refueling speculation_that kidder is getting_out of the brokerage business entirely . mr._carpenter denies the speculation . to answer the brokerage question , kidder , in typical fashion , completed a task-force study . the result : kidder will focus_on rich individual_investors and small_companies , much closer to the clientele of goldman , sachs_& co. than a serve-the-world firm like merrill_lynch or shearson_lehman hutton_inc . mr._carpenter notes that these types_of investors also are `` sophisticated '' enough not to complain_about kidder 's aggressive use of program_trading . as_part of the upscale push , kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course , turning them into `` investment counselors '' with knowledge of corporate_finance . they will get `` new and improved tools 0 to sell , particularly to the affluent investor , ''_says brokerage chief charles v. sheehan . theoretically , the brokers will then be_able to funnel `` leads '' on corporate_finance opportunities to kidder 's investment_bankers , possibly easing the longstanding tension_between the two camps . however , skeptics caution that this_kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment_bankers looks great on paper , but does_n't always happen . kidder competitors are n't outwardly hostile to the firm , as many are to a tough competitor like drexel_burnham lambert_inc. that does_n't have kidder 's long_history . however , competitors say that kidder 's hiring binge involving executive-level staffers , some with multiple-year contract guarantees , could backfire unless there_are results . the departing mr. cathcart says_0 he has no worries_about kidder 's future . mr. cathcart , who will return to the quaker oats co. board of directors , in_addition to his personal ventures , is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling kidder . he also improved the firm 's compliance procedures for trading . mr. cathcart says_0 he has had `` a_lot of fun '' at kidder , adding 0 the crack about his being a `` tool-and-die man '' never bothered him . `` it was an absolutely marvelous line and one 0 i used many times , '' he_says . smiling broadly when he talks about mr._carpenter , mr. cathcart says_0 the new kidder chief is `` going_to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business . '' in coming years , mr. cathcart says_0 , kidder is `` gon na hum . '' or , as mr._carpenter , again drawing on his consulting-firm background , puts it : ``_we 're ready to implement at this point .
