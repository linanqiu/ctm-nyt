consumer_prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2_% in_september , pushed_up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , the labor_department reported 0 . energy costs , which drove wholesale_prices up sharply during the month , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs . the report was the brightest news 0 the financial_markets had seen since before the stock_market plunged more_than 190_points last_friday . the dow_jones industrial_average rallied on the news , closing 39.55 points_higher at 2683.20 . bond_prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest_rates may fall . but many_economists were not nearly as jubilant . the climb in wholesale energy_prices is certain to push up retail energy_prices in the next_few months , they warned 0 . they also said_0 the dollar is leveling off after a rise this_summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods . ``_i think_0 inflation is going_to pick_up through the fall , '' said joel popkin , a specialist on inflation who_runs an economic consulting_firm here . `` it has_been in what i would describe as a lull for the past_several months . '' ``_we 've_had whopping declines in consumer energy_prices in each of the past_three months , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said jay woodworth , chief domestic economist_at bankers_trust co. in new_york . because wholesale energy_prices shot up by a steep 6.5_% last_month , many analysts expected energy_prices to rise at the consumer level too . as a result , many_economists were expecting the consumer_price index to increase significantly more_than it did . but retail energy_prices declined 0.9_% in_september . though analysts_say 0 competition will_probably hold down increases in retail energy_prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year . still , some_analysts insisted_that the worst of the inflation is behind . `` it increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued edward yardeni , chief_economist at_prudential-bache securities inc. in new_york . in both 1987 and 1988 , consumer_prices rose 4.4 % . a run-up in world oil_prices last winter sent consumer_prices soaring at a 6.7_% annual_rate in the first five_months of this_year , but the subsequent decline in energy_prices has pulled the annual_rate back down to 4.4 % . mr. yardeni predicted that world business competition will_continue to restrain prices . `` the bottom_line is , 0 it seems to me that the economic environment has_become very , very competitve for a_lot of businesses , '' he said . `` back in 1987-88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt 0 they could raise prices . '' now , he said_0 , a slowdown in economic_activity has slackened demand . the mild inflation figures renewed investors_' hopes that the federal_reserve will ease its interest-rate stance . the steep climb in producer prices reported last_friday fostered pessimism about lower_interest rates and contributed_to the stock_market 's 6.9_% plunge that day . in the past_several days , however , the u.s. 's central_bank has allowed a key interest_rate to fall slightly to try_to stabilize the markets . analysts_say 0 fed policy_makers have_been wary of relaxing credit too_much because_they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy . excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some_economists call the core inflation_rate -- consumer_prices still rose only 0.2_% in_september . transportation costs actually fell 0.5_% , and housing costs gained only 0.1_% . apparel prices rocketed up 1.7_% , but that was after three_months of declines . medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0.8_% after four consecutive months of 0.7_% increases . car prices , another area that contributed_to the steep rise in the wholesale index last_month , still showed declines at the consumer level . they dropped 0.4_% as dealers continued to offer rebates 0 to attract customers . food prices_rose 0.2_% for the second month in a row , far slower_than the monthly rises earlier in the year . separately , the labor_department reported that average weekly earnings rose_0.3 % in_september , after adjusting for inflation , following a 0.7_% decline in_august . all the numbers are adjusted_for seasonal fluctuations . here are the seasonally_adjusted changes in the components of the labor_department 's consumer_price index for september .
