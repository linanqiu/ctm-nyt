a federal_appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part_of $_1 billion in costs from controversial `` take-or-pay '' contracts . the court , in a 3-0 ruling , threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory_commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did_n't use . ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march_31 , 1989 , to pass on to customers as_much as 50_% of the costs of buying out their broken contracts , which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short . a majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled_at steep discounts . but pipeline companies estimate 0 they still face $_2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes , including $_1 billion 0 they fear 0 they wo_n't be_able to pass on to customers . according_to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an_important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take_advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism . the court left open whether ferc could reimpose a new deadline later . the court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found 0 the march_31 deadline was `` arbitrary and capricious '' and `` highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines '' that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline . a report last_month by the interstate natural_gas association of america found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three_months before the deadline to 39_cents on the dollar , from 22_cents on the dollar in 1988 . the court ordered ferc to justify within 60_days not_only its cost-sharing deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation . the court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could_be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities . the complex regulation , known in the industry as order 500 , has_been hotly contested by all sides , including natural-gas producers , pipelines , local distribution companies and consumers . the court 's decision would_allow ferc to change some of its provisions , but ensures 0 it will_be reviewed again quickly by the court .
