japanese_companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales . but fujitsu_ltd. has_taken that practice to a new extreme . japan 's_biggest computer_maker last_week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of hiroshima 's waterworks . its bid : one yen , or less_than a u.s. penny . the bid created such a furor that fujitsu said_0 it is now offering to withdraw_from the project . `` from a common-sense viewpoint , it was not socially acceptable , '' a fujitsu spokeswoman_said yesterday . hiroshima city_officials could_n't be_reached to find_out whether they would drop fujitsu 's bid . fujitsu said_0 it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market . ``_we desperately wanted the contract because we_want experience in the field , '' the fujitsu spokeswoman_said 0 . ``_we expect a big market in the future , so in the long_term it will_be profitable . it 's a kind_of an investment . '' hiroshima 's waterworks bureau said_0 the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen_-lrb- $ 77,500 -rrb- for the project . ``_i was flabbergasted , '' tatsuhara yamane , head of the bureau , was_quoted by kyodo news service as saying . ``_i understand the firm 's enthusiasm in getting the deal , but such a large company would_have been better_off showing a little more discretion . '' indeed , fujitsu officials admitted 0 they may_have been a little overzealous . the fujitsu spokeswoman_said 0 headquarter officials did_n't approve the bid in advance and will_take measures so this_kind of thing does_n't happen in the future . `` it 's contrary to common_sense , '' she_added . specifically , fujitsu won the right to design the specifications for a computerized system that will show water lines throughout the city . the system could_be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems , among_other things . a waterworks official said_0 fujitsu will have to design the system so it would_be compatible_with other makers ' equipment . but industry officials expressed_concern that the initial project might give fujitsu an edge in winning more lucrative contracts later . fujitsu said_0 it hopes 0 the hiroshima contract will_help it secure pacts with other municipalities . japanese local_governments are_expected to invest heavily in computer_systems over the next_few years , and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue . `` in the near_future , it will_be a big market , not just for waterworks , but for all mapping systems , '' the fujitsu spokeswoman_said . ``_we can expect a hundreds-of-billions-of-yen market . '' no foreign companies bid on the hiroshima project , according_to the bureau . but the japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by americans as a classic barrier to entry in japan 's market . earlier_this year , the u.s. complained_that japan 's supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by slashing prices as_much as 90_% for universities . fujitsu was n't the only company willing_to sacrifice profit on the project . three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen , according_to the hiroshima government office . other bids ranged_from about 10 million yen to 29 million yen .
