the stock_market correction of oct._13 , 1989 , was a grim reminder of the oct._19 , 1987 market collapse . since , like earthquakes , stock_market disturbances will always be with us , it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse . in general , markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances . but there_are times when they seize up , and panicky sellers can_not find buyers . that 's just what_happened in the october_1987 crash . as the market tumbled , disorderly market_conditions prevailed : the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened ; trading in many stocks was suspended ; orders took unduly long to be_executed ; and many specialists stopped trading altogether . these failures in turn contributed_to the fall in the market averages : uncertainty extracted an_extra risk premium and margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures . the situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope . his skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control . unable_to stop his accelerating descent , he crashes . after the 1987_crash , and as a result of the recommendations of many studies , `` circuit_breakers '' were devised to allow market_participants to regroup and restore orderly market_conditions . it 's doubtful , though , whether circuit_breakers do any real good . in the additional time 0 they provide even more order imbalances might pile up , as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone . instead , an appropriate institution should_be charged_with the job of preventing chaos in the market : the federal_reserve . the availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience . the fed already buys and sells foreign_exchange to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign-exchange markets . the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities . the stock_market is the only major market without a market-maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort . this does_not mean that the federal_reserve does_not already play an_important indirect role in the stock_market . in 1987 , it pumped billions into the markets through open_market operations and the discount window . it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage_houses . they , in turn , lent money to their customers -- who were supposed_to recognize the opportunity 0 to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares . the fed also has the power 0 to set margin_requirements . but would n't it be more_efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock_market directly ? instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the fed could support the stock_market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . the stock_market is certainly_not too big for the fed to handle . the foreign-exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger . daily_trading volume in the new_york foreign_exchange market is $_130 billion . the daily_volume for treasury_securities is about $_110 billion . the combined value of daily equity trading on the new_york exchange , the american_stock exchange and the nasdaq_over-the-counter market ranges between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion . the $ 13 billion 0 the fed injected into the money markets after the 1987_crash is more_than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day . more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action . and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money_supply , such_as happened in october_1987 . the fed 's stock_market role ought not to be very ambitious . it should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the dow_jones or new_york stock_exchange averages at a particular level . the fed should guard against systemic risk , but not against the risks inherent in individual_stocks . it would_be inappropriate for the government or the central_bank to buy or sell ibm or general_motors shares . instead , the fed could buy the broad market composites in the futures market . the increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices . stabilizing the derivative_markets would tend_to stabilize the primary market . the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather_than attempting_to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks . disorderly market_conditions could_be observed quite frequently in foreign_exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s . but since the member countries of the international_monetary fund agreed_to the `` guidelines to floating '' in 1974 , such difficulties have_been avoided . i can_not recall any disorder in currency markets since the 1974 guidelines were adopted . thus , the mere existence of a market-stabilizing agency helps to_avoid panic in emergencies . the old saying advises : `` if it ai_n't broke , do_n't fix it . '' but this could_be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed . mr. heller , now at visa international , was a governor of the federal_reserve board from 1986 until earlier_this year . this is adapted from a speech to the commonwealth club in san_francisco .
