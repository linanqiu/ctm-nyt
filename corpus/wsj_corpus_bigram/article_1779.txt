after days of intense but fruitless negotiations , a federal_judge last_week threatened to convert william herbert_hunt 's chapter_11 personal bankruptcy case into a chapter 7 liquidation . judge harold c. abramson raised the possibility after talks 0 to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran_into roadblocks . if the case is converted to chapter 7 , what remains of the oil tycoon 's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a value of less_than $_125 million -- would_be sold_off quickly with most of the proceeds going_to the internal_revenue service , whose claim for $_300 million in back taxes has priority in the case . hundreds_of smaller creditors could_get nothing , according_to attorneys involved . while admitting 0 such a move would_be `` devastating '' to most creditors , judge abramson told a courtroom filled_with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned_about the toll 0 mounting legal bills will_take on mr._hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact_that , following voting by creditors , none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form . `` it would_be a shame to have a chapter 7 after all the progress in this case , '' said judge abramson . under_chapter 11 of the federal_bankruptcy code , a company continues to operate under protection_from creditors_' lawsuits while it works out a plan 0 to pay its debts . under_chapter 7 , the assets of a company are sold_off to pay creditors . despite his reluctance to take the latter step , the judge indicated 0 he would move_quickly after hearing testimony later_this week in the bitter dispute_between manufacturers_hanover trust_co. and minpeco s.a. , a minerals concern owned_by the peruvian governmemt . the manufacturers_hanover corp. unit , which is_seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan , has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of minpeco , which won a $ 132 million judgment against mr._hunt , his brother nelson bunker hunt and other defendants last_year in a case stemming_from their alleged attempts_to corner the silver market in while claiming that penalties , legal_fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more_than $_250 million , minpeco has_agreed to_settle for an allowed claim of as_much as $ 65.7 million . but even that is disputed by manufacturers_hanover which , in alliance_with the irs , contends_that minpeco has already collected more_than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver-conspiracy case . under prodding from judge abramson , a minpeco executive flew in from peru last_week to talk directly with executives from manufacturers_hanover on a settlement . despite long private sessions in both new_york and dallas , the two_sides ended the week `` 6,000 miles and many dollars apart , '' according_to attorney hugh ray , who_represents manufacturers_hanover . meanwhile , inside the courtroom , the judge said_0 he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $ 50 every time 0 they referred to each_other with terms such_as `` liar '' or `` slime . '' all three major creditors -- the irs , minpeco and manufacturers_hanover -- voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization_plan proposed by mr._hunt . a reorganization_plan proposed jointly by the irs and manufacturers_hanover was stalled by a negative vote from minpeco . the mineral concern 's own reorganization_plan met a similar fate after opposition from the irs and manufacturers_hanover . neither plan is dead , however , and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the minpeco-manufacturers hanover dispute . meanwhile , settlement negotiations continue between mr._hunt and the irs , which has already reached a tentative_agreement with nelson bunker hunt . the two_sides have_been far apart on how_much herbert_hunt will_continue to owe the government after his assets are sold .
