the house_appropriations committee approved an_estimated $_2.85 billion in emergency funding 0 to_assist california 's recovery from last_week 's earthquake and to extend further aid to east_coast victims of hurricane_hugo . the package was termed excessive by the bush_administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential california lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $_1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds . by a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more_expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between appropriations_committee chairman jamie whitten -lrb-_d. , miss . -rrb- and his party 's_largest state delegation in the house . ``_i have no regrets about going forward , '' said rep. vic fazio -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting . ``_we are the golden state , '' mr. fazio said , `` and there_is a certain amount of jealousy . '' the $_2.85 billion package incorporates $_500 million for small-business loans , $_1 billion in highway construction funds , and $_1.35 billion divided_between general emergency_assistance and a reserve 0 to be available to president_bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two_disasters . the funding is attached to a stopgap bill 0 to_keep most of the government operating through_nov. 15 . the measure is_expected to come before the house today , and congress is under_pressure to complete action before midnight edt tomorrow , when the current continuing resolution expires . given california 's size and political importance , the white_house is eager to appear generous . but in private meetings yesterday , budget_director richard_darman argued_that only $_1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources . a white_house budget office analysis estimates that $_500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance 0 to meet california 's needs , and the administration rejects the notion_that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster_loans by the small_business administration . `` everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we_'ve got to address it , '' said mr. darman , who came to the capitol to meet with mr._whitten and california lawmakers before the committee session . ``_i would hope very_much that we would n't end_up in a kind_of situation where you have a bidding_war and then a veto threat . '' although this white_house pressure was clearly a factor among committee republicans , no single influence was greater_than mr._whitten . a master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $_2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to_keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative . when mr. fazio offered the california-backed $ 3.84 billion plan , mr._whitten insisted_that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel 's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought_by the delegation . on the chairman 's motion , the california package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , mr._whitten pointedly opposed it . more_important than money in many cases are waivers 0 california is_seeking on current restrictions covering federal_highway funds , such_as a $_100 million cap on how_much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year . mr._whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put_up any matching_funds on repairs completed in the next six_months . a member in the house leadership and skilled legislator , mr. fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not_only by california 's needs but by hurricane_hugo amendments 0 he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel . the california_democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on_behalf of owners of private beaches in the virgin_islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $_100 million in federal_aid 0 to plant timber on private land in north and south_carolina . california 's high-priced real_estate puts it in an awkward position , too . one provision last_night would_have raised the cap on disaster_loans to $_500,000 from $_100,000 per household to accommodate san_francisco losses .
