a federal_appeals court in san_francisco ruled_that shareholders ca_n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news_media concurrently revealed substantial information_about the product 's flaws . the ruling stems_from a 1984 suit_filed by shareholders of apple_computer inc. , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the lisa computer , introduced in_1983 . lawyers specializing_in shareholder suits said_0 they_are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . according_to the suit , apple officials created public excitement by touting lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year . the plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with lisa . the suit claimed 0 apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ 63.50 a_share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . but when the company revealed lisa 's poor sales late in_1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ 17.37 a_share , according_to the suit . the shareholders claimed more_than $_150 million in losses . in 1987 , the san_francisco district_court dismissed the case largely_because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by alerting consumers to lisa 's problems . late_last month , the appeals_court agreed that most of the case should_be dismissed . however , it gave the shareholders the right to_pursue a small portion_of their claim that pertains to lisa 's disk_drive , known_as twiggy . the court ruled_that the news_media did_n't reveal twiggy 's problems at the time . lawyers are worried_about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed_out that the court stressed_that the ruling should_be regarded_as very specific to the apple case . `` the court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , '' said patrick grannon , a los_angeles lawyer at the firm of greenfield & chimicles , which was n't involved in the case . `` the court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders . '' shareholders_' attorneys at the new_york firm of milberg , weiss , bershad , specthrie & lerach last_week petitioned for a rehearing of the case . they wrote : `` the opinion establishes a new rule of immunity -- that if a wide_variety of opinions on a company 's business are publicly reported , the company can say anything without fear of securities liability .
