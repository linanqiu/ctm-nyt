in what could_prove a major addition to the philippines ' foreign-investment portfolio , a taiwanese company signed a $ 180_million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex . taiwan 's usi far_east corp. , a petrochemical company , initialed the agreement_with an unidentified japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker , according_to alson lee , who_heads the philippine company set_up to build and operate the complex . mr._lee , president of luzon petrochemical corp. , said_0 the contract was signed wednesday in tokyo with usi far_east officials . contract details , however , have n't been made public . the complex is to be located in batangas , about 70 miles south of manila . usi far_east will hold a 60_% stake_in luzon petrochemical , according_to papers signed with the philippine government 's board of investments . the proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives , polypropylene and polyethylene . these are the raw_materials used in making plastics . the contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project . at an_estimated $ 360 million , the project would represent the single largest foreign_investment in the philippines since president corazon aquino took_office in february 1986 . it also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities . the project has_been in and out of the pipeline for more_than a decade . however , workers ca_n't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved , moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment . as previously_reported , a member of the philippines ' house of representatives has sued to stop the plant . the legislator , enrique garcia , had actively backed the plant , but at the original site in his constituency northwest of manila . the country 's supreme_court dismissed the suit , but mr. garcia late_last month filed for a reconsideration . in_addition , president aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48 % tax on naphtha , the principal raw_material 0 to be_used in the cracker . however , at a news_conference thursday , mrs. aquino backed the project and said_0 her government was attempting_to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site , adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in bataan province . ``_we have tried our best to tell the people in bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them , but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province , '' mrs. aquino told manila-based foreign correspondents . the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier_this month when the other major partner in the project , china general plastics corp. , backed out . china general plastics , another taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer , was to have a 40_% stake_in luzon petrochemical . however , mr._lee said that usi far_east is confident 0 other investors will_take up the slack . he said_0 usi far_east has applied to both the asian development bank and the world bank 's international finance corp. for financing that could include equity stakes .
