new orders for durable_goods fell back slightly in_september after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990_models , the commerce_department reported 0 . orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected to last at_least three_years dipped 0.1_% last_month , to $ 126.68 billion , after leaping 3.9_% in_august , the department said_0 . most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in_august . moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed_to perceptions that the manufacturing_sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl . but many_economists pointed to a 1.8_% september rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category . that `` suggests 0 the manufacturing_sector is not falling apart , '' said_0 sally kleinman , an_economist at manufacturers_hanover securities corp. in new_york . she_added , however : `` it is not robust by any means . '' while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up . orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56_% , and a government analyst said_0 nearly all areas saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment . orders for military goods usually catapult in_september , government_officials say_0 , as the pentagon scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal_year begins oct._1 . while all the numbers in the durable_goods report were adjusted_for seasonal fluctuations , a commerce_department analyst said that the adjustment probably did_n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders . without the increase in defense bookings , september orders would_have plummeted 3.9_% . analysts were most unsettled by evidence 0 the backlog of orders at factories is slipping . unfilled_orders for durable_goods rose 0.4_% in_september , to $ 476.14 billion , after declining for the first_time in 2_1\/2 years in_august . in july unfilled_orders grew 1 % . but analysts noted_that excluding transportation - where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed_up the figures - order backlogs have declined for three_months in a row . `` it means 0 we_'re eating into the bread that keeps us going . that is a little disturbing , '' ms. kleinman said . `` it also means 0 if_you have a real drop-off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there_is less 0 to_keep things going . '' capital_goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , posting a 5.6_% drop after a 10.3 % decline . such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy . but a commerce_department analyst said that in both months orders would_have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier_this year . still , milton hudson , senior economic adviser at morgan guaranty trust_co. in new_york , said : `` if_you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty_good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector . now at_least there_are question marks about that , and without_any question the pace of growth has slowed .
