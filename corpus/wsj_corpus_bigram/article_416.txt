oil_spill case shows liability fund flaws an unresolved two-year-old dispute stemming_from an alaskan oil_spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws 0 to_protect victims of such accidents . the class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the trans-alaska pipeline liability fund , which gets its money from oil_companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills . on july 2 , 1987 , the tanker s.s. glacier bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the cook inlet . commercial fishermen and fish processors filed_suit in federal_court in a claim that has ballooned to more_than $ 104.8 million . defendants include british_petroleum america ; trinidad corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund . the fund was created_by the trans-alaska pipeline act , which_provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil_spill must_pay the first $ 14 million in damages . the fund is required to pay claims up to an_additional $ 86 million . the fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief . but the glacier bay case , the fund 's first test , shows_how easily the fund can_be undermined . trinidad corp. is contesting liability . it claims 0 the coast_guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . that means 0 the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at_least so_far . the oil pollution act , scheduled to come_up for a vote in congress this_fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90_days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says_0 a spokesman for rep. george miller -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- , a sponsor of the bill . the spokesman says_0 the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind_of catch-22 .
