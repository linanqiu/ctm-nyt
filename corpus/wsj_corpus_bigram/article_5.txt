former usx corp. chairman david m. roderick may_have been lucky 0 he retired last may . as he handed over the reins to successor charles a. corry , steel profits were close to a cyclical peak . though imports were troublesome , they_were n't running away with the market , and american companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would_be extended for another five_years . perhaps most_important , carl_icahn , who had once threatened a hostile_takeover bid , was subdued . he and mr._roderick were even dining out together . today , mr._corry presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly . mr._icahn , the company 's deep-pocketed , tenacious adversary , recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to 13.1 % , and he again threatened a takeover . a battle with mr._icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief_executive , to say nothing of one who_took the helm less_than five_months ago . in_addition , usx 's giant steel segment , representing 34_% of its 1988 sales , is facing softening demand and slipping prices as_well as increasing competition_from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills . the import quotas got only a 2 1\/2-year extension , and usx is laboring under a staggering $ 5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil . `` it 's a baptism of fire for corry , ''_says one usx executive . the burning question is whether the new chief can parry mr._icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves . mr._corry might_have to dismember the company more_than he_wants to . or he might_have to incur a huge expense of either buying mr._icahn 's stock , possibly at a premium , or paying stockholders a special_dividend partly_because of mr._icahn 's pressure . with his recent purchases of usx common_stock , mr._icahn shattered a three-year-old , unwritten standstill_agreement with mr._roderick . in 1986 , mr._roderick adroitly dodged mr._icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4 %_stake . mr._roderick did so by having usx redeem a series of guaranteed notes , a move that , in effect , raised the cost of a $ 7.19 billion icahn bid by about $_3 billion . and he managed to fend_off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper . over dinners at new_york 's sky club and links club restaurants , the steel executive and the big investor talked steel , international_trade and thoroughbred horses . mr._corry , who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading t. boone pickens 's autobiography , had_hoped 0 the detente would_continue . he was shocked , associates say_0 , to learn of mr._icahn 's new takeover_threat . -lrb- both_men declined to be_interviewed for this_article . -rrb- but the fiercely competitive mr._corry quickly showed 0 he 's no pushover . he huddled with directors at a special_meeting two_weeks ago and tried_to block his opponent . although the board believed that mr._icahn is more interested_in talking the stock price higher_than acquiring usx , it adopted a poison-pill defense , 0 to be swallowed if anyone amasses a 15_% stake . now , it 's mr._icahn 's move . will he try_to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies ? given the weakness of the junk-bond_market , can he finance a buy-out ? mr._icahn may_not want to sell out unless he can_get a special_dividend similar to one 0 he received before selling his stake_in texaco inc. in june -- a coup that gave_him enough cash 0 to make his usx move . and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets , by making it harder to arrange takeover financing , has eased some of the pressure_on mr._corry , it_does n't end the takeover_threat . ``_i know 0 it 's not over , '' a sober-faced mr._corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in new_york on_oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of kobe_steel ltd. , usx 's partner in a steel mill in lorain , ohio . in fact , it 's barely begun for mr._corry , who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job . `` he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his_own , ''_says bryan jacoboski , a securities analyst_at painewebber_inc . the 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief_executive . an undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded_that he could_n't stand cutting up frogs , mr._corry wanted to work for a big company `` that could do big things . '' but after joining the tax department of a usx subsidiary 30_years ago , he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46 . for years , he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms , wearing a hat to work because everyone_else did . ``_i was never a rebel , '' he said in an earlier interview . ``_i do_n't think_0 most of the people that have_been around me would ever say_0 they_'ve seen me pound the table or get angry . '' yet , the unassuming mr._corry helped chart usx 's transition from big steel to big oil . he served_as mr._roderick 's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of marathon oil for $_5.9 billion . nevertheless , mr._corry , once named_chief executive , did_n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss , who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the usx tower in pittsburgh . soon_after taking_over last_june , mr._corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers , a move that mr._roderick had n't made in spite of improved_earnings . mr._corry also ruled_that all board meetings would_be held in pittsburgh instead of new_york or findlay , ohio , marathon 's home . and , earlier_this month , he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas , which was acquired three_years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since . one former executive says , `` nobody wanted that deal inside usx except dave roderick , '' who was a hunting and fishing buddy of william l. hutchison , chairman of texas oil & gas . the executive recalls mr._corry whispering to him and others , `` remember , this was dave 's deal . '' what miffed many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition , for $_3 billion of stock , doubled the usx shares_outstanding and considerably diluted them . what 's more , the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years . mr._corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to delight mr._icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder_value . but when the two_men met in new_york a day after mr._icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake , mr._corry learned that mr._icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion_cubic feet of natural_gas and 28 million_barrels of oil but also its pipeline , gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations . that would_leave usx with marathon , its steel mills and its diversified business segment , which_includes , among_other things , mineral and transportation products . some speculate that mr._corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price . the problem is that mr._icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr._corry had planned . mr._icahn has long believed , associates say_0 , that the company , whose 1988 sales totaled_$ 16.88 billion , is worth $_70 a_share if broken up . the stock closed_yesterday at $ 33.625 , giving mr._icahn 's 33.6 million_shares a value of $ 1.13 billion . mr._icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations , and mr._corry does_n't necessarily disagree . unlike his predecessor , who saw steel as america 's backbone , mr._corry tends_to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential , associates say_0 . in the past_five years , usx has_turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor_costs . but the short-term outlook is so-so . it is n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry view steel so differently . while mr._roderick was reared in the shadows of pittsburgh 's smoking mills , mr._corry grew up in cincinnati , a city nicknamed `` porkapolis '' and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron . he has never met lynn williams , the president of the united_steelworkers union , and is n't active in the industry 's main trade_group , the american_iron and steel_institute , which mr._roderick served_as chairman . `` dave thought_0 the country needed a strong u.s. steel and , while chuck agreed , he was more apt to say , ` not at any cost to shareholders , ' '' a former executive says . indeed , mr._corry , at an august press conference , talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and `` not a day longer . '' however , shedding steel would run directly counter to mr._roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas : having two major products would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings . as mr._roderick once said : ``_we 're a two-product company and , boy , if_you ca_n't figure_out the value of those two parts , you are so damn dumb that you_do n't belong on_wall street . '' moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to usx may_be gone , for now . `` the time has passed 0 for us to spin_off steel , '' either in a public_offering or to a buyer , one executive contends_0 . about the only way_0 that usx now can_get out of steel is to dish it out , piece by piece , in separate joint_ventures , he_adds 0 . with mr._icahn breathing down his neck , however , mr._corry may_have little choice but to sell at a weak price , even_if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards . that would_leave usx essentially an oil company with marathon as its_core . marathon has benefited_from higher crude-oil prices and strong_demand for refined products . oil has long been mr._corry 's pet . indeed , when the bush_administration finally decided this_summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most_important decision 0 to affect the steel industry in five_years -- mr._corry and his directors were aboard helicopters , high above marathon 's rich oil reserves in the north_sea . should usx be left with only marathon , mr._corry might well feel pushed to scout out other energy companies . however , even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals . ``_i do_n't think_0 he has a clear sense of where he_wants the company to go , '' one says . right_now , the executive adds 0 , `` he_wants to continue to focus_on paying down '' usx 's debt by selling assets . one_thing is certain , however : mr._corry , while studying other options , probably_wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr._icahn 's intentions . and then , `` he wo_n't panic , ''_says 0 j. bruce johnston , a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with adler cohen & grigsby in pittsburgh . mr._corry learned presence under fire when , as vice_president of corporate planning , he handled what mr. johnston calls `` don't-con-me '' negotiations that led to usx 's shedding of a wide array_of assets ranging_from chemicals to construction . when negotiating , mr._corry played his cards close to the vest . johnnie johnson , who_worked for mr._corry in strategic planning , recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates . `` what he really wanted to know was about a particular company , but you did_n't know that . he wanted your_own unbiased , virgin opinion , ''_says mr._johnson , now managing_director at georgeson &_co. , a proxy-solicitation and investor-relations firm . ever the pragmatist , mr._corry said in_august that he realized that usx is on `` acquisition screens all over the country . '' `` it 's part_of the capitalistic market system that equity can_be bought and equity is bought , '' he said . usx , he_noted 0 , was formed 88 years_ago , `` by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies ... . people got rich through takeovers in those days , as they do today .
