british_airways plc , a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of ual_corp. , washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of united_airlines . specifically , the british carrier said_0 it currently has no plans to participate_in any new offer for ual . in_addition , british_air officially withdrew its support for the previous $_300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said `` the original deal is closed . '' company officials said later that british_airways believes_0 its involvement in the ual_buy-out ended last_friday when the buy-out_group , which also_includes ual 's management and pilot_union , failed to_obtain financing for the $_6.79 billion transaction . the carrier stopped short of saying_0 it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for ual . however , company officials said_0 they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't_aware '' of any restructured bid in the making . collectively , the statements raised questions_about whether a new bid for ual will ever get off the ground . the transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last_friday , with no_signs or statements from the buy-out_group 0 to indicate that any progress has_taken place . however , in response to the british_air decision , united 's pilot_union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out . pilot_union chairman frederick c. dubinsky said_0 advisers to ual management and the union will_begin meeting in new_york today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal 0 to present to ual 's board `` at the earliest time possible . '' pilot_union advisers appeared confident_that a new bid could go forward even without british_air 's participation . ual declined to comment_on british_air 's statement . ual chairman_stephen m. wolf , who is leading the management end of the buy-out , has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal . in another setback yesterday , united 's machinist union asked the treasury_department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws . in an_effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the securities and exchange_commission , transportation_department and labor_department . but there was one bright spot yesterday . the united flight-attendants union agreed_to negotiations that could_lead to the flight_attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake . the pilot_union , the only one 0 to support the buy-out thus far , said_0 the flight_attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief_that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' still , without the assurance of british_airways ' financial backing , it will_be tougher for the buy-out_group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments_for a revised_bid , especially since british_air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . under the previous plan , british_air would_have received a 15_% stake_in ual in exchange for a $_750 million equity investment , with a 75_% stake going_to ual employees and 10_% to ual management . british_air officials said_0 the airline 's chairman , lord king , was concerned_about news reports indicating that british_air might_be willing_to participate_in a bid that included a lower purchase_price and better investment terms for the british carrier . the previous reports were based_on remarks by british_air 's chief_financial officer , derek stevens , who said_0 any revised_bid would_have to include a lower purchase_price to reflect the sharp_drop in ual 's stock in the past_week . ual_stock dropped $ 1.625 yesterday to $ 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange . ual declined to comment_on british_air 's statement . in an_interview wednesday with dow_jones professional_investor report , mr._stevens said , ``_we 're in no_way committed to a deal going through at all . we_'re not rushing into anything . we_do n't_want to be party to a second rejection . '' indeed , british_air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an_effort to_avoid any further embarrassment . the original transaction fell through on the same day 0 british_air shareholders_approved the plan at a special_meeting after the british succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution . the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american counterparts . `` the -lcb- buy-out -rcb- consortium ceased to exist because our american partners were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a british_air spokesman_said . british_airways may_have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the transportation_department forced northwest 's airlines_' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of klm royal dutch airlines in that carrier . most of the department 's statements since the northwest transaction indicated 0 it planned to curtail foreign_ownership stakes in u.s. carriers . even_before british_air 's announcement , pilot_union leaders had_been meeting in chicago yesterday to consider their options . the leaders expressed support for trying_to revive the bid following a briefing wednesday by the union 's advisers , lazard_freres &_co. and paul , weiss , rifkind wharton & garrison . they also unanimously re-elected mr. dubinsky , the union chairman who has led the pilots_' 2 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline . ual 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they_want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid . they have maintained that banks remain interested_in financing the transaction . the buy-out fell through after citicorp and chase_manhattan corp. , the lead banks in the transaction , failed to_obtain $ 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
