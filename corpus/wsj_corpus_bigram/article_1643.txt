democracy is making a return with a vengeance to latin_america 's most populous and deeply indebted country . on nov._15 , when brazilians elect a president for the first_time in 29 years , the country 's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates 0 to choose from . the candidates have_been crisscrossing this huge country of 145_million people , holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must_be one of the world 's most thankless political jobs : trying_to drag brazil out of its economic and social mess . ``_i feel sorry for whoever wins , ''_says a brazilian diplomat . who that winner will_be is highly uncertain . a half-dozen candidates , backing policies ranging_from thatcherism to watered-down marxism , are given a chance of winning . `` whoever says_0 he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind , ''_says antonio britto , a centrist member of parliament . the favorite remains fernando collor de mello , a 40-year-old former governor of the state of alagoas . he came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls , probably less because of his vague program 0 to `` build a new brazil '' than because of his good looks , the open backing of the powerful rede globo television_network and his_reputation as a hunter of `` maharajahs , '' or overpaid and underworked civil servants . but after building up a commanding lead , the moderate to conservative mr. collor has slipped to about 30_% in the polls from a high of about 43_% only a few_weeks ago . to_avoid a runoff , one candidate would_have to win 50_% of the vote -- a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so_many candidates running . two left-wing politicians , socialist leonel brizola , a former governor of rio de janeiro state , and marxist-leaning luis inacio da silva , currently are running neck and neck at about 15_% , and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters : social democrat mario covas and two conservatives , paulo salim maluf , a former governor of the state of sao paulo , and guilherme afif domingos . the uncertainty is sending shivers through brazilian financial_markets . the dollar , the best indicator of the country 's mood , has skyrocketed on the parallel market , as has gold . capital flight is reported to be strong . the big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in congress 0 to take steps to cure brazil 's economic ills . president jose sarney , who_took office in 1985 when the man picked by an electoral college became critically ill , appears to be simply trying_to avoid hyperinflation . the unpopular mr. sarney , whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule , is n't seeking re-election . what comes out of the ballot box could_be crucial in determining whether brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world 's eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other , less enviable title : that of the developing world 's_largest debtor , teetering on the brink of hyperinflation , mired in deficits and stagnation , with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface . if brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt , this could_lead it to open up and deregulate its sheltered economy , analysts_say , just as argentinian president_carlos saul menem has_been doing even_though he was_elected on a populist platform . `` depending_on the president , we could either be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are , ''_says political scientist amaury de souza . `` and where we are is bad . '' despite valiant efforts by finance_minister mailson ferreira da nobrega , inflation came to 36_% in_september alone and is_expected to top 1,000 % for the year . that might_have been considered hyperinflation not long ago , but argentina endured price increases of almost 200 % in july before bringing the rate down sharply in_august and september . still , massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2_% to 3_% a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper . about $_70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market , which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government . by some estimates , brazil 's internal debt , or combined public deficit , could reach 6.5_% of its $ 351 billion gross_domestic product . much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating . among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services . it 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking_up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number . officials also say_0 a national electricity shortage might_not be far off . economists , businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending ; focusing spending on vital areas such_as education , health and welfare ; turning state companies private ; reforming the tax system , raising public_service rates to match costs ; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado . analysts also say_0 it 's inevitable that brazil will seek to renegotiate its $_115 billion foreign_debt , on which it suspended interest_payments last_month . analysts_say , however , that a tough economic program would_have to be accompanied_by measures 0 to shield the poor from its recessionary effects , for_instance by subsidizing staple food items . about 80_% of brazil 's voters are believed to live near the poverty level . of the three candidates with a serious chance of winning , mr. collor comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that economists say_0 are necessary . but his inexperience raises doubts that he would_have the political power to carry them out . the 67-year-old mr. brizola has_been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric , but analysts_say 0 he probably would_be pragmatic . mr. da silva , a 43-year-old former factory worker and labor leader , is the most radical , vowing to withhold payments on the foreign_debt and saying_0 he `` would n't go around putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder . '' but despite the differences in what they say , according_to some_analysts here , economic constraints mean_0 the next president may_not have many choices about what he does .
