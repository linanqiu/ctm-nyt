'' there_were no complaints from affiliates of cbs_inc. and cable_news network , a unit of turner_broadcasting system inc . but that was not the case at nbc_news , which has_been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories . last_summer , the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in china . ``_i was not pleased_with the slow start , and neither was nbc_news , '' said guy hempel , general_manager of nbc affiliate wave in louisville , ky . a spokesman for national_broadcasting co. , a unit of general_electric co. , said_0 the network was `` looking into what_happened . '' the stations said_0 they_were pleased_with the extended coverage yesterday , including a special five-hour edition of `` today . '' don browne , director of news at nbc_news , said in an_interview that ``_we could_n't get a signal out of san_francisco . we were out of the box . it was horrible . the comment 0 we_'re hearing is that we were slow out of the box , but beat everyone_else in the stretch . '' nbc broadcast throughout the entire night and did_not go off the air until noon yesterday . the quake postponed the third and fourth games of the world_series . in place of the games , abc said_0 it planned to broadcast next_week 's episodes of its prime-time wednesday and thursday lineups , except_for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last_night . the series is_scheduled to resume tuesday evening in san_francisco . `` there_are no commercials 0 to make up for since we_'re going_to eventually broadcast the world_series , '' said a network spokesman .
