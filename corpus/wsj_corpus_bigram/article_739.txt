okay , now you_can pick_up that phone . but do_n't do_anything rash . after last_friday 's stock-market plunge , investment professionals cautioned people to resist the urge to call their brokers and sell stocks . not selling into a panic turned_out to be very_good advice : despite the market 's volatility , the dow_jones industrial_average has surged 114 points in the past_four days . now , with a semblance of normalcy returning , some advisers_say 0 it 's time for investors to take a hard , cold look_at the stocks 0 they own and consider some careful pruning . `` the market is sending nervous signals , ''_says 0 peter j. canelo , chief market_strategist for bear , stearns_& co. , and it 's `` unwise '' to be overcommitted to stocks . alan weston , president of weston capital_management , a los_angeles money-management firm , adds that in periods of uncertainty like today , `` it 's a good time 0 to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio . '' not everybody agrees that it 's time 0 to trim . ``_we are n't inclined to prune stock portfolios now , ''_says steven g. einhorn , chairman of the investment policy committee of goldman , sachs_& co . `` investors should stay with their stocks . we_expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period , but we_do n't_think 0 it will_be ugly . the downside is limited . '' and even those_who say_0 some selective selling may_be in order stress that individuals need to be in the stock_market to achieve their long-term investment objectives and to help balance their other assets . any selling , they say_0 , should_be well thought-out , and executed gradually , during market rallies . they offer these suggestions : get_rid of the dogs . `` sell stocks that are n't doing_well now , and that do_n't have good earnings prospects , ''_says alfred goldman , technical analyst_at st. louis-based a.g. edwards &_sons . `` most people do just the opposite : they sell their winners and keep their losers . '' which types_of stocks are most_likely to qualify ? technology_stocks , says_0 mr. goldman . watch for earnings disappointments . a company does_n't have to post a loss to be a candidate for sale , says_0 charles i. clough jr. , chief market_strategist at merrill_lynch &_co . if earnings do_n't live up to analysts_' expectations , he_says 0 , that 's enough to dump the stock . john markese , director of research for the american association of individual_investors , raises a cautionary note . `` substituting a rule of thumb for your_own judgment '' can_be a mistake , he_says 0 . an earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that 's short-term . but mr. clough says , `` the risk is that earnings disappointments will_continue . '' the economy is decelerating after six good years , and `` right_now it 's better to shoot first and ask questions later . '' which types_of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks ? computer companies ; commodity cyclical stocks , like autos ; and retailing stocks , he_says 0 . beware of heavy debt . the companies apt to run_into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads , says_0 larry biehl , partner in the san_mateo , calif. , money-management firm of bailard , biehl & kaiser . mr. canelo of bear_stearns agrees : `` if we_do have an economic_slowdown , '' he_says , `` companies with high debt ratios will_be dumped en masse . '' the best course for individual_investors is to sell these stocks now , the two advisers_say 0 . sell ` whisper ' stocks . ual_corp. 's difficulty in obtaining bank_financing for its leveraged_buy-out and its resulting price plunge is a tip-off to what 's going_to happen to `` takeover_stocks , ''_says 0 mr. canelo . takeover_activity will slow_down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements , he_says 0 . `` there 'll_be fewer and fewer deals . '' moreover , many financial advisers_say 0 individuals should_be in the stock_market as long-term investors , not as traders trying_to catch the next hot stock . in general , they say_0 , avoid takeover_stocks . compare p\/e ratios with prospects . mr. canelo suggests_that investors compare price\/earnings ratios -lrb- the price of a_share of stock divided by a company 's per-share_earnings for a 12-month period -rrb- with projected growth rates . `` if_you think_0 earnings will grow at 20_% a year , it 's all right to pay 20 times earnings , '' he_says . `` but do_n't pay 30 times earnings for a company that 's expected to grow at 15_% a year . '' mr. canelo thinks_0 the market will_probably go higher , but `` will_be ruthless with stocks if the earnings are n't there . '' mr. markese cautions that investors should n't slavishly follow any specific price\/earnings sell trigger . `` if_you say sell anytime 0 a company 's price\/earnings ratio exceeds 15 , that knocks out all your growth_stocks , '' he_says . `` you eliminate companies with substantial prospects that are moving up in price . '' examine what has_changed . tom schlesinger , market analyst_at a.g. edwards &_sons inc. , says_0 investors should_consider selling if there has_been a fundamental_change in a company since they bought its stock . say_0 you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works . now , because of various difficulties , the product has_been scrapped . time 0 to sell , says_0 mr. schlesinger . similarly , he_says 0 , suppose 0 you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit $_200 million by 1990 . if things have n't worked_out that well , and sales wo_n't hit $_200 million until 1992 , it 's time 0 to consider selling , he_says 0 .
