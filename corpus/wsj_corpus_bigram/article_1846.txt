federal_reserve critics used to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policies . they claimed that the fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt . but under alan_greenspan that has_changed . a supremely cautious man , the fed_chairman is forever blinking yellow . indeed , his caution has_become legendary within the government . he fusses endlessly over economic statistics , dissecting them in dozens_of ways , probing for hours in search of potential problems . after thoroughly digesting reams of information , he often concludes that more data are needed , and when he finally decides to act , his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small . such caution was_evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock_market plunge . some bush_administration officials urged mr._greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets . but he refused , claiming that he wanted to see what_happened monday_morning before making any public statement . mr._greenspan 's decision to_keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the fed 's ranks . a `` senior fed official '' spoke on saturday after the market swoon to both the washington_post and the new_york times , saying_0 the fed was prepared to provide as_much credit as the markets needed . the statement angered chairman_greenspan , but it was greeted with applause by the bush_administration and the financial_markets . and , while the mutinous fed member has n't gone public , some fed governors , most notably vice_chairman manuel johnson , are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent . ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for mr._greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source . at a hearing last_week , democratic_sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury_secretary nicholas_brady that `` chairman_greenspan 's '' announcement over the oct._13 weekend was a `` very_important statement . '' mr._brady hesitantly replied that he was n't sure whether mr._greenspan `` made a statement himself , or whether that was a newspaper report . '' the fed_chairman 's caution was apparent again on the monday_morning after the market 's plunge , when the central_bank took only modest steps 0 to aid the markets . a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking_system . and , by the end of that week , the key federal_funds interest_rate , which is largely controlled_by the fed , had settled_at 8.75_% , barely changed from the level of just under 9_% that prevailed the previous_week . bush_administration officials appear increasingly concerned that mr._greenspan is cautious to a fault . signs of growing weakness in the economy , paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control , have caused them to wonder why the fed_chairman is so grudging in reducing rates . those concerns are n't expressed in public . in fact , the administration and the fed have_been going out of their way in the past_two weeks to dispel any impression that they_are at_odds , fearing 0 stories about an administration-fed split added to the stock_market 's jitters . still , the split is there . the administration 's concerns are understandable . the economy is showing_signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers . exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two_years , seem to have stalled . factory payrolls and production fell in_september , and the auto_industry and housing are in a severe crunch . but mr._greenspan remains reluctant_to loosen policy , partly_because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional fed banks who oppose credit easing . in_addition , the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road . inflation may_be stable at the moment , running at about 4.5_% . but if the fed eases too_soon , mr._greenspan fears 0 , prices may begin to accelerate again next_year . moreover , if the fed holds tight , it may_be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the fed_chairman embraced in testimony to congress last_week . so_far , mr._greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well . his hand on the monetary tiller seems one_reason why the economy next_month seems highly likely_to begin an_unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession . ``_we 've gotten through two stock_market crashes , and we_'ve gone through an election without_any major problems , ''_says david hale , an_economist of kemper_financial services . ``_i think_0 you have to give greenspan a good rating . '' but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes . the fed 's reluctance to ease_credit now could_be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early_next year . if that happens , chairman_greenspan could well become an open target . already , congress is toying with legislation 0 to curb the fed 's independence . if the economy turns down , such proposals could gain strong momentum .
