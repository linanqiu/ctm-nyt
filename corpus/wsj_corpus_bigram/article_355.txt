a bill that would_permit the securities and exchange_commission to monitor the financial_condition of securities_firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some wall_street firms , which argue_that the legislation is unnecessary . the legislation and other issues related to the stock_market will_be the focus of hearings this_week by the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee and the senate securities subcommittee . richard_breeden , the new chairman of the sec , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the sec additional authority during market emergencies . however , he recently told the senate_banking committee that he_believes 0 the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans . the bridge loans are intended_to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield_junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond_market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated_with wall_street firms issuing bridge loans . but some wall_street executives argue_that such fears are unwarranted . in a july 6 letter to the senate securities subcommittee , first_boston corp. argued_that the fact_that no retail brokerage_firm failed during the 1987 market_crash demonstrates that current_rules are adequate . first_boston , whose holding_company , cs_first boston group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on_wall street , said_0 it is also concerned that once the sec has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try_to regulate their activities . `` the proposal , while well-intended , i_think 0 can_be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would_be to weaken , rather_than strengthen the control 0 the sec has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' michael raoul-duval , managing_director of first_boston , said in an_interview . the bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away_from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no_way of affecting broker-dealers , '' mr. raoul-duval said_0 . sources in the industry and on_capitol hill say_0 a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the sec 's concerns may_be possible . an_aide to the senate securities subcommittee says_0 some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds_: `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . '' edward o'brien , president of the securities industry_association , said that the securities-industry trade_group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful 0 a compromise can_be reached to achieve the sec 's goals . '' mr. o'brien will elaborate on the sia 's position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this_week , a spokesman_said 0 .
