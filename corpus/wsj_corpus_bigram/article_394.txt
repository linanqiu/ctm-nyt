the bakersfield supermarket went out of business last may . the reason was not high_interest rates or labor_costs . nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential inwood section of northern manhattan . the business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers . the owner was israel ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two . in his first year of operating the store 0 he bought for $ 220,000 , mr. ortiz was robbed at_least twice at gunpoint . the first_time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside . the second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged . two_weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- mr. ortiz was shot three_times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt . that was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent . for providing what his customers described_as very personal and helpful service . for creating a focus for neighborhood life . israel ortiz is only one of the thousands_of entrepreneurs and their employees who will_be injured or killed by crime this_year . the u.s. bureau of justice statistics reports that almost 2_% of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four_times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople . only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such_as police , bartenders and taxi drivers . yet these figures show only the most visible part_of the problem . recent data from new_york city provide more of the picture . while by no means the highest crime community in the country , new_york is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development . a survey of small_businesses there was conducted this spring by interface , a policy research organization . it gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses . the survey_found that over a three-year period 22_% of the firms said_0 employees or owners had_been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job . seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed . crime was the reason that 26_% reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19_% said_0 they_were considering moving . more_than one-third of the responding businesses said_0 they suffer_from drug dealing and loitering near their premises . in brooklyn and the bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year . industrial neighborhoods fare even_worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average . crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses . two_decades ago , the small_business administration reported yale prof. albert reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small_businesses drawn from national irs records . he found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small_businesses than for large ones . the new_york study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $_15,000 , with an_additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at_least one more worker . the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business . whatever the monetary crime losses , they may_not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury . after repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their_lives . one washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises . these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that national_institute of justice director james k. stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . '' underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses . this may help explain_why small_businesses create 65_% of all jobs nationally , but only 22_% of jobs in a crime-ridden city like new_york . bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime . the new_york study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer_than five employees was almost $_1,000 per worker , compared_with one-third that amount for firms with more_than 10 employees . the shift of retailing to large shopping_centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments . private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places . since_1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % . few small neighborhood businesses , however , can_afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants . in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small_business generally relies_on the public police force for protection . this creates several problems . one is that there_are not enough police to satisfy small_businesses . the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new_york survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more_than two-thirds of the respondents . only 22_% supported private security patrols funded_by the merchants themselves . a second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less_than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small_businesses . only half the new_york small_businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response 0 they receive . some cities , including new_york , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded_by local businesses . but this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship . another solution 0 cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas . for cities losing business to suburban shopping_centers , it may_be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . increased patrolling of business zones makes_sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . with national_institute of justice support , the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols . small-business patrols would_be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is_scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . while no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks . it might even have saved the life , and business , of israel ortiz . mr. sherman is a professor of criminology at the university of maryland and president of the crime control institute in washington , d.c .
