chicago - options_traders were among the big victims of friday_'s plunging stock_market , including one small firm that required an_emergency $ 50_million bailout . while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover_stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses , traders here and in new_york said_0 . options_traders were hurt worse_than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several_times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they_are based . thus , options_traders friday were stuck_with losses that also were several_times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new_york . jeffrey miller of miller tabak hirsch &_co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is `` very easy for these_guys to get wiped_out . that may just be the nature of these highly_leveraged little creatures . '' an options contract gives the holder the right to buy -lrb- call -rrb- or sell -lrb- put -rrb- a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based_on a predetermined price within a given time period . options_traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling . they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss . the latest round of losses is_likely to be a serious blow to the chicago_board options_exchange , which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of black_monday , when investors fled the market because of huge_losses . making matters worse was the fact_that late_friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago_mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index_futures . but while the merc reopened a half_hour later , the cboe remained closed , leaving many options_traders unable_to make trades that might_have reduced the losses . cboe chairman alger `` duke '' chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options_exchange has to open in a rotation that allows each different options series to trade . exchange officials reasoned that they would n't have_been able_to make such a rotation with the time remaining friday_afternoon , and with the stock-index_futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time , the cboe reasoned that its best course was to remain closed . the damage was so bad at fossett corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago , a unit of continental_bank corp. , as a result of options trading losses . fosset so_far is the only member of a financial exchange 0 to be_forced to be taken_over by another firm as a result of friday_'s rout . fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after friday_'s close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried_about another potential market_plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options_exchange officials said_0 . thus , in an_unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer , the cboe , the american_stock exchange and the options_clearing corp. , as_well as the firm 's owner , stephen fossett , put_up a total of $ 50_million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank_holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . s. waite rawls iii , vice_chairman of continental_bank , first options ' parent_company , said_0 the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by fossett , almost_all of them belonging to professional floor_traders . `` steve and his firm were still worth a_lot of money , '' mr. rawls said . `` a package of credit support was put_together --_including the assets of steve and his firm . '' the bailout was cobbled together over the weekend , with officials from the federal_reserve board , securities and exchange_commission , comptroller of the currency and treasury as_well as the options exchanges . `` it was great to have the luxury of time , '' mr. rawls said . at one_point , an options industry official had to talk the federal_reserve bank of chicago 's night watchman into giving him the home phone number_of silas keene , chicago fed president . first options did_n't have to put any money into the bailout . yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led cboe and amex officials to conclude that the $ 50_million in guarantees almost_certainly wo_n't need to be tapped by first options . the fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the october_1987 crash as_well , mr. rawls said_0 . a federal official said that continental_bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the fossett bailout , but that conditions were n't dictated by those agencies . `` it was their business decision , '' the official said . officials at options_clearing corp. , which processes all options trades for u.s. exchanges , said that the $ 50_million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . `` it was an_extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said paul stevens , occ president and chief_operating officer . mr._stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50_million guarantee from each participant . but cboe and amex officials said that options_clearing corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the cboe put_up $ 8 million , the amex added $_4 million and $ 18 million came from mr. fossett 's own assets . mr. fossett could_n't be_reached to comment .
