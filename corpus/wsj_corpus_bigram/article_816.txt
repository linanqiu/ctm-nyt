michael maynard offered the world a faster way_0 to break eggs . as thanks , the egg industry tried_to break him . and the egg_producers have done a pretty_good job . they tried_to put mr._maynard out of business by an act of congress . egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban mr._maynard 's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella . his company , misa manufacturing inc. , was forced to seek protection_from creditors_under federal_bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated . monthly sales of his egg_king machine -- which he now is marketing through a new company -- have sunk to about_half a dozen from a peak of 75 , says_0 the 46-year-old businessman . mr._maynard is n't the first entrepreneur 0 to bump up against entrenched interests . but his case is notable both for the scale of the fight -- it is n't often that a congressional_hearing is held to determine_whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic -- and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product . now one might ask why people_who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying_to make it easier to crack them . part_of the answer lies in the nature of the industry . many larger egg_producers are also egg processors , who crack , inspect , and sanitize billions of eggs , turning them into powdered , liquified or frozen egg products . however , dozens_of bakers , restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to mr._maynard 's defense say that products ranging_from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells . but for companies that use hundreds_of eggs a day , breaking them by hand can_get , well , out of hand . the idea behind the egg_king is pretty simple : put the eggs into a cylinder that contains perforated baskets , spin them at a high speed to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets . one egg_king -- which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has_been likened to the robot r2-d2 -- can crack about 20,000 eggs an_hour . because fresh eggs are less_expensive than processed ones , a big egg user can recover the egg_king 's $ 3,390 cost in a few_months , says_0 mr._maynard . such centrifugal egg breakers have_been around since the 1890s . but when mr._maynard came forward with his machine in the early_1970s nobody else was offering them in the u.s. . the main_reason : salmonella . chickens carry this bacteria , which can cause upset stomachs and , in rare cases , death among people . hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs , and it can also be found on unclean shells . thus , any machine that breaks large_amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones . mr._maynard claims 0 this is a manageable problem . the egg_king carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have_been properly sanitized and , as an added precaution , to use the eggs only in products that will_be cooked enough to kill bacteria . with nearly 4,000 machines in use , there have_been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed , mr._maynard boasts 0 . he_says 0 the handful_of salmonella cases involving products that may_have used eggs broken by an egg_king stemmed_from a failure to adequately cook the products . but he_says 0 that 's no more a reason for banning egg kings than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars . opponents do_n't buy such arguments . `` human nature being what it is , people do_n't always follow instructions , ''_says jack guzewich , chief of food protection for the new_york state health department . leading the assault against the egg_king has_been united egg_producers . the decatur , ga. , trade_group has issued a `` briefing book '' that claims 0 the machine is `` a health hazard '' and that mr._maynard is trying `` to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation_'s egg_producers . '' the uep declines to comment , but the group 's attorney , alfred frawley , says_0 the group 's actions are motivated solely by `` health concerns . '' an early battleground was the u.s. department of agriculture . mr._maynard initially won approval for his machine to be_used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the usda 's food safety inspection service . unfortunately for mr._maynard , another branch of the usda , the agricultural marketing service , was in charge of eggs . after receiving complaints from egg_producers , this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval , thus limiting the machine 's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that are n't regulated by the usda . the egg_producers also lobbied the food and drug_administration . but the fda in a 1985 letter to the united egg_producers said that there was `` little likelihood '' of a health problem as long as instructions were followed . so the producers went to capitol_hill , where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines . mr._maynard , whose company at the time was based in santa_ana , calif. , enlisted his local congressman , and the battle was joined . mr._maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure , though it took a vote_on the floor of the house of representatives to do it . even then , opponents managed to get a congressional_hearing to examine what one congressman called an `` unscrupulous '' method for breaking eggs . foiled in their effort to get a national ban , the egg_producers turned their attention to the states . so_far , new_york , new_jersey , nebraska , georgia , michigan and minnesota have outlawed mr._maynard 's device , citing health concerns . an antitrust_suit that mr._maynard 's company filed in los_angeles federal_court against the united egg_producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes . the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr._maynard 's company to pay over $_100,000 in legal_fees to the defendants ' lawyers . mr._maynard says_0 the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy_court . now he has moved to oklahoma where costs are lower , and started a new company , adsi inc. , 0 to market his machine . but , so_far , the change of scenery has n't ended his string of bad breaks . mr._maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm .
