after watching interest in the sport plummet for years , the ski_industry is trying_to give itself a lift . across the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers . some have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more 0 to do than ski . and this_week , the industry 's efforts will_go national for the first_time when it unveils a $ 7 million advertising_campaign . such efforts -- unheard of only a few_years ago -- are the latest attempts_to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion u.s. ski_industry . since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have_grown only 3_% a year on average , compared_with 16_% annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s . last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first_time in seven_years . by some estimates , nearly a fourth of all u.s. ski areas have_been forced to shut_down since the early '80s . competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have_been the undoing of many resorts . but another big problem has_been the aging of baby_boomers . skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby_boomers have outgrown skiing or have too_many family responsibilities 0 to stick with the sport . in its new ad_campaign , created_by d'arcy masius benton & bowles inc. , chicago , the ski_industry is trying_to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people . one 60-second tv spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier . `` ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope . `` you_'ll never know 'til you try , ''_says a black skier . ``_we used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , ''_says kathe dillmann , a spokeswoman for the united ski industries association , the trade_group sponsoring the campaign . ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety . but the new commercials deal_with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries_to get up from a fall . ``_we wanted to show 0 it 's okay if_you fall , ''_says ms. dillmann . `` most people think_0 if_you slip , you_'ll wind_up in a body cast . '' the ad_campaign represents an_unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers ; normally , they only run ads hyping their_own products and facilities . but in these crunch times for the ski_industry , some resorts , such_as the angel fire , red river and taos ski areas in new_mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each_other 's slopes and next_year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts . many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business . since 40_% of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids . vail , colo. , now has a playland that looks_like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold . for $ 15 , they_can enjoy their_own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad . a few_years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children . `` most parents who had to go through that never came back , ''_says michael shannon , president of vail associates_inc. , which_owns and operates the vail and nearby beaver creek resorts . to make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their_own travel agencies . in one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons . and resorts are adding other amenities , such_as pricey restaurants , health spas and vacation packages with a twist . during winter carnival week , for_example , visitors at sunday river in maine can take a hot-air balloon ride . `` people these_days want something else 0 to do besides ski and sit in the bar , ''_says don borgeson , executive_director of angel fire , n.m. 's chamber of commerce . the ski_industry hopes to increase the number_of skiers by 3.5_million to about 21.7 million in the next five_years with its latest ads and promotions . but some think_0 that 's being overly optimistic . for one_thing , it may_be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising . and most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions . an american_express co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34_% believe_0 their_clients will pick a trip this winter based_on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will_be the deciding factor . `` even_if they could bring in that many new skiers , i_do n't_know if -lcb- the industry -rcb- could handle that kind_of an_increase , ''_says i. william berry , editor and publisher of the ski_industry letter in katonah , n.y . `` most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will_be overcrowded and then these -lcb- new skiers -rcb- wo_n't come_back .
