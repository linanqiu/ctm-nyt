with economic tension_between the u.s. and japan worsening , many japanese had feared last_week 's visit from u.s._trade representative_carla hills . they expected a new barrage of demands that japan do_something quickly to reduce_its trade_surplus with the u.s. . instead , they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work_together and of the importance of the long-term view . mrs._hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last_month 's visit by commerce secretary robert_a. mosbacher . mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next_spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . he said_0 such results should_be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the u.s._trade deficit with japan . but mrs._hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday , stressed_that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' she_added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step 0 to convince the american people and the japanese people that we_'re moving in earnest . '' how such remarks translate_into policy wo_n't become clear for months . american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen mr. mosbacher and mrs._hills . many called it simply a contrast in styles . but some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . others said_0 the bush_administration may feel 0 the rhetoric on both_sides is getting_out of hand . and some said_0 it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan versus some_kind of managed trade . asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's , mrs._hills replied : 0 ``_i did_n't hear every word 0 he spoke , but as a general proposition , i_think 0 we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush_administration . '' yet more_than one american official who sat in with her during three_days of talks_with japanese officials said_0 her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . '' ``_i think_0 my line has_been very consistent , '' mrs._hills said at a news_conference saturday afternoon . ``_i am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because i have a ferocious list of statutes 0 to implement . i_do n't feel very ferocious . i_do n't feel either hard or soft . i_feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . '' when she met the local press for the first_time on friday , mrs._hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest_products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill . she highlighted exclusionary business practices that the u.s. government has identified . but her main thrust was to_promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . she said_0 the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets . at her news_conference for japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the japanese sense of relief . `` my impression was that you would_be a scary old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his_colleagues . `` but i_am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . '' mrs._hills ' remarks did raise questions , at_least among some u.s. officials , about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market . the u.s. share of the japanese market has_been stuck around 10_% for years . many americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring u.s. companies a 20_% share by 1991 , but the japanese have denied making any such promise . at one of her news conferences , mrs._hills said , 0 ``_i believe_0 we_can do much better_than 20_% . '' but she stressed , 0 ``_i am against managed trade . i will not enter into an_agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market .
