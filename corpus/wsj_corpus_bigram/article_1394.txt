avis inc. , following rival hertz_corp. 's lead , said_0 it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines . the garden city , n.y. , car-rental company said_0 it wo_n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest_airlines unit , pan_am corp. 's pan_american world airways unit and midway airlines at the end of this_year . but it remains involved in programs with amr_corp. 's american_airlines unit and delta_air lines . industry estimates put avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million . a spokesman for avis would n't_specify the costs but said_0 the three airlines being dropped account for `` far_less than_half '' of the total . budget rent a car corp. , of chicago , and national car_rental systems_inc. , of minneapolis , both said_0 they had no plans to follow_suit . in fact , budget indicated 0 it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can_get car-rental discounts . ``_i can_not see_how this news by hertz and avis can_not benefit budget 's programs , '' said bob wilson , budget 's vice_president , marketing planning . northwest and midway are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements . national also participates in the northwest frequent-flier program along_with four other airlines , including delta and usair_group inc. 's usair unit . a month ago , hertz , of park ridge , n.j. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta , america_west and texas_air corp.

'' this_year has_been difficult for both hertz and avis , said_0 charles finnie , car-rental industry_analyst at alex . brown_& sons . `` they_'ve been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way_0 to do it , '' he said .
