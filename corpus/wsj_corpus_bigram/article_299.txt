the justice_department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges_against white-collar defendants . the most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal_prosecutors avoid disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said_0 . another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third_parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , david runkel , said_0 . the department distributed the revisions and clarifications to u.s._attorneys around the country this_summer as_part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , mr._runkel said_0 . the changes apply to prosecutions brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law . under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may_be charged_with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise . the rico law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense_lawyers . they_argue that the rights of rico defendants and third_parties not named in rico indictments have_been unfairly damaged . the department 's most significant clarification of existing rico policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , mr._runkel said_0 . `` that means that if the offense deals with one part_of the business , you_do n't attempt_to seize the whole business ; you attempt_to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . in general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there_are less intrusive means of protecting assets 0 the government may subsequently be_able to seize after a conviction , mr._runkel said_0 .
