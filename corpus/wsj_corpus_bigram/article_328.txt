china could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next_year , a western government report says_0 , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit . according_to the report , completed last_month , if china_'s trade_gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven_months of this_year , the reserves would_be wiped_out either in 1990 or 1991 . a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three_months of its imports . the $ 14 billion of reserves 0 china had in june would cover just that much . the report by the western government , which declines to be_identified , concludes that `` a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can_be avoided only if import growth drops to below 5_% per annum . '' according_to chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent_months , dropping to 16_% in july and 7.1 % in_august from the year-earlier periods , compared_with an_average growth_rate of 26_% in the first_half . but before import growth slowed , china_'s buying spree in the first_half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves . the $ 14 billion level in june marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of april . china_'s last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ 10.6 billion in june 1985 from $ 16.6 billion the previous september . china might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline , when beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency . but this time , china faces a more_difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the tiananmen square killings june_4 . for_example , china_'s hard-currency income is_expected to suffer_from the big drop in tourist arrivals since_june 4 . revenue from tourism this_year is projected to total $_1.3 billion , down from $_2.2 billion last_year . because of this and the huge trade_gap , the deficit in china_'s current_account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is_expected to widen sharply from the $_3.8 billion deficit last_year . the western government report suggests a number_of scenarios for china_'s current-account balance , two of which are considered most_likely . in one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25_% and 5_% recorded during the first seven_months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion . in 1985 , china had a record deficit of $ 11.4 billion . the other scenario assumes that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming_months . in this case , china would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $ 8.7 billion , based_on projections that imports for all of this_year grow 20_% and exports 10_% . if china were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might_be able_to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit . but since_june , foreign bankers led_by international financial_institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china . even_if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as_much as before . in_addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china_'s deteriorating political and economic environment . on top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are_expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 . with less capital coming in , china_'s balance of payments would suffer . the western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30_% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5_% contraction in foreign direct_investment . in the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10_% and investment to drop 10_% . but in either case , the report says_0 , china_'s balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance . in the first scenario , the reserves would_be exhausted next_year , and in the second they would_be wiped_out in 1991 .
