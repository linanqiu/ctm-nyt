tuesday 's rout of a gop congressional hopeful in a mississippi district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since adlai stevenson is another reminder that , at_least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has_been on the rise over the past half century . in only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more_than 20_% of the nation_'s congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the white_house than for the house of representatives . now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has_been above 40_% . as we_know , voters tend_to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress . in every presidential election over the past half century , except_for the goldwater presidential candidacy , the gop has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress . prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite . what accounts for the results of recent decades ? a simple economic theory may provide at_least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by americans in the voting booth . the theory relies_on three assumptions : 1 -rrb- voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest . 2 -rrb- congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing_with national issues -lrb- programmatic actions such_as casting roll_call votes on legislation that imposes costs and\/or confers benefits on the population at large -rrb- and attending to local issues -lrb- constituency service and pork barrel -rrb- . 3 -rrb- republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing_to engage_in local_benefit-seeking than are democratic members of congress . if these assumptions hold , voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean democratic . if_they put a republican into office , not_only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will_be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their_respective constituencies . each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making . in races for the white_house , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean republican . although a gop president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district\/state , such a president is also likely_to be more effective at preventing other districts\/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits . the individual voter 's standing consequently will_be enhanced through lower taxes . while this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things . first , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : prior to the election of franklin roosevelt as president and the advent of the new deal , government occupied a much_smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for congress was considerably less severe . second , it explains why voters hold congress in disdain but generally love their_own congressional representatives : any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated_with every other legislator doing likewise for his_own constituency . third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too_much attention to national policy making relative to local_benefit-seeking have lower security in office . for_example , first-term members of the house , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat . the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman republicans brought into office in 1980 by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 . because these freshmen placed far_more emphasis_on their partisan role -- spreading the reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they_were more vulnerable to defeat . fourth , the theory indicates why the republican party may_have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office . potential candidates may_be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent . to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the republican party will_be hindered in its attempts_to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates . fifth , the theory may provide at_least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has_been particularly pronounced in the south . to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since 1932 and have_been able_to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their_respective constituencies , voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to_keep such democrats in office . finally , the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house . since local_benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress , this is precisely the pattern 0 one would expect if republicans are less willing_to engage_in local_benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts . is there any empirical support for this theory ? three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing_to engage_in local_benefit-seeking than their republican colleagues . first , economists james bennett and thomas dilorenzo find that gop senators turn back roughly 10_% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do . to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local_benefit-seeking , this indicates_that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . second , if the key assumption is valid , democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away_from the time 0 a legislator could otherwise devote to local_benefit-seeking . this is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the house . the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since 1959 . finally , as shown in the table , democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local_benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to washington offices . an examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the senate between 1986 and 1987 -lrb- when control of that body changed party hands -rrb- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can_not be attributed to the disproportionate control 0 democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such_as committee staff . an_additional piece of evidence from the senate : holding other_factors constant , such_as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference_between popular votes for republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a senate election turns_out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal_government 's tax burden is per state -lrb- a progressive tax_rate hits higher-income states harder -rrb- . put more simply , gop candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than republican candidates for the senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe . moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it_does at the federal level . state government is more typically split along republican-governor\/democratic-legislature lines than the reverse . a cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other_factors constant , the difference_between a state 's major-party vote going_to the republican gubernatorial candidate and the republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax_rate . in sum , at both the federal and state government levels at_least part_of the seemingly irrational behavior 0 voters display in the voting booth may_have an exceedingly rational explanation . mr. zupan teaches at the university of southern_california 's business school .
