criticism in the u.s. over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations . officials from both nations say_0 the u.s. public 's skittishness about japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next_week in washington . not that washington and tokyo disagree on the japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come_out in favor of unfettered investment in the u.s. . where they disagree is on the subject of u.s. direct_investment in japan . the u.s. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; japan denies 0 there_are real barriers . the heated talk stirred up by recent japanese investments in the u.s. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even_though it 's only one of many subjects 0 to be_covered in the bilateral talks , known_as the structural impediments initiative . the japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their_own economy , ''_says 0 charles dallara , u.s. assistant treasury_secretary , who has_been in tokyo this_week informally discussing the impending negotiations_with government and business_leaders . ``_we have a long_history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy , '' mr. dallara says . `` u.s. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct_investment '' in japan . the japanese fret openly about the u.s. public 's rancor . one clear sign of japan 's nervousness came this_week , when a spokesman for japan 's foreign_ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent japanese investments in the u.s. . ``_we believe_that it is vitally important for those japanese business interests -lcb- in the u.s. . -rcb- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the american people , '' said the spokesman , taizo watanabe . at the same_time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably britain , are acquiring more american assets . fears that japanese_investors are buying up america have escalated sharply in the past_several weeks , with sony_corp. 's purchase of columbia_pictures entertainment_inc. from coca-cola_co. and mitsubishi_estate co. 's acquisition of a 51_% holding in rockefeller_group , the owner of some of midtown manhattan 's most exclusive real_estate . even_before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had_been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in japan of one u.s. investor , t. boone pickens jr . the texas oilman has acquired a 26.2 %_stake valued_at more_than $_1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company , koito manufacturing co . but he has failed to gain any influence at the company . koito has refused_to grant mr. pickens seats on its board , asserting 0 he is a greenmailer trying_to pressure koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit . mr. pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in japan . the senate_finance committee , chaired by a fellow texan , democratic_sen. lloyd_bentsen , last_month urged u.s._trade representative_carla hills to use mr. pickens 's experience in talks_with tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital_markets . '' while mr. dallara and japanese officials_say 0 the question of investors_' access to the u.s. and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number_of other important economic issues will_be on the table at next_week 's talks . among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending . each side has a litany of recommendations for the other . the u.s. says_0 it is anxious for results . ``_we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues 0 we_'ve identified , and we_need it by next_spring , '' mr. dallara says . both_sides have agreed that the talks will_be most_successful if negotiators start by focusing_on the areas that can_be most easily changed . but they have n't clarified what those might_be . after the first set of meetings two_months ago , some u.s. officials complained_that japan had n't come_up with specific changes 0 it was prepared to make . the japanese retort that the first round was too_early to make concessions . `` just to say_0 the distribution system is wrong does_n't mean anything , ''_says a ministry of international_trade and industry official . ``_we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . '' that process of sorting out specifics is_likely to take time , the japanese say_0 , no_matter how badly the u.s. wants quick results . for_instance , at the first meeting the two_sides could_n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions . since_then , a team of about 15 miti and u.s. commerce_department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer_prices . by monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents 0 both_sides can trust . `` little by little , there_is progress , ''_says the miti official . `` both_sides are taking action .
