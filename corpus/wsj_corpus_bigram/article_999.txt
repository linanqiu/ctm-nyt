in_august , soon_after wang laboratories_inc. reported a staggering $ 424.3 million loss and replaced its president , two boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : ``_we fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` amazing comeback at wang . ' '' how soon wang will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate . but wang salespeople are trying_to cope_with the biggest challenge 0 any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes . `` if your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you_'re not feeling as if_you 're backed up by a stable company , you_'ve lost it before you_'ve begun , ''_says mary ann cluggish , a wellesley , mass. , sales trainer and consultant who_works with high_technology companies . it can_happen in any industry . consider the difficulties faced by audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or exxon dealers ' problems in the wake_of the valdez oil_spill . like thousands_of salespeople before them , wang_'s are finding ways_0 to combat the bad_news . `` it 's very_important that we exude confidence , even_though within the family we_know 0 there 's a_lot of hard work ahead , '' said richard miller , the lowell , mass. , computer concern 's new president , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took_over . wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts . its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal_computers . last_year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing , and it suffered huge_losses when sales turned_down instead of rising . after the company reported red_ink for the fiscal third_quarter , wang_'s marketing department provided the sales_force answers to questions such_as `` how could you not have known 0 you were going_to lose $_55 million ? '' and `` is wang still a viable company ? '' salespeople try_to push their products and avoid discussions of finances . responding to such questions is `` defensive , ''_says kenneth olissa , wang_'s vice_president , marketing . `` that 's antithetical to the art of selling . '' moreover , he notes that analyzing financial results `` poses a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar_with a balance_sheet . '' at one sales strategy meeting , an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report . mr._miller vetoed that : `` even i_ca n't understand all the footnotes , '' he_says . instead , he_says 0 , if the salespeople can_get the customers to consider wang_'s products on their merits , he or a top financial_officer will try_to assuage the fears_about finances . mike metschan , a salesman in wang_'s austin , texas , office , has a breezier method : ``_we tell_them 0 $_3 billion companies do_n't go out of business . we tell_them 0 all the major companies are having financial difficulties . '' numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to wang_'s or are carrying such a large debt_load . mr._miller says that after a sharp sales slump in july and august , sales stabilized in_september . although wang will report a loss for the first_quarter ended_sept. 30 and the full fiscal_year , mr._miller says_0 he_expects 0 the company will return to profitability by the fourth_quarter . experts on sales technique say_0 anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line . `` if a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will_be a problem for the long_run , ''_says george palmatier , a minden , nev. , sales consultant and author of `` the marketing edge . '' still , says john sullivan , a management recruiter with daniel roberts inc. of boston , who has held senior sales positions at polaroid and atari : `` the customer will react to strength . ignore the present condition . show 0 it 's business as_usual . '' that is n't easy . wang_'s customers are data_processing managers who_want to be_sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will_be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years 0 to come . for buyers , `` these are career-risking decisions , ''_says 0 jean conlin , who supervises a network of wang computers in the admissions department at boston university . the university is_considering installing a $_250,000 system 0 to store applications electronically . `` before the really bad_news , we were looking_at wang fairly seriously , '' she_says . but `` their present financial_condition means 0 i_'d have a hard time convincing the vice_president in charge of purchasing . '' ms. conlin adds_: `` at some point we_'d have to ask , ` how do we_know that in three_years you wo_n't be in chapter_11 ? ' '' during the past year , wang has_developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president . wang_'s overall product_line is `` still not as good as other vendors , but they_'ve come a long_way , ''_says 0 steven wendler , a consultant with market researcher gartner group , stamford , conn . `` they_were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened . '' the first priority for wang_'s sales_force is to make_sure 0 it holds on to existing customers . wang_'s installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal . but even_before wang_'s latest financial troubles surfaced , some customers `` were trying_to wall off their wang installations '' so other departments would n't add wang , says_0 chris christiansen , a former wang marketer who is now a market analyst_with meta group , a market research_firm in stamford , conn . one wang salesman who left the company in july recalls that when he tried_to sell products to eastman_kodak , he worked `` to muster support from internal allies , '' but `` those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend . the more recent losses were really devastating . '' new customers , the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to wang_'s long-term viability , are even tougher . rick lynch , a former top salesman in wang_'s boston office , referring_to wang_'s mainstay computer line , says : `` you_ca n't sell a vs to a new customer . '' mr. lynch left wang this_summer for oracle systems_inc. , a software vendor . the financial_problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing wang_'s image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents . consultants say that wang_'s technology is among the best available in the image market . but salespeople often found that news of wang_'s problems superseded their sales efforts . william tait , a former sales manager in indianapolis , says that his office had all but sold a $_1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker eli_lilly &_co . `` when they_were making the decision , all hell broke loose with the finances . '' he_says 0 the lilly executives told_him 0 they could_n't take the risk with wang . mr. tait say_0 he does_n't blame lilly . buyers have to rely_on a supplier `` continually upgrading and replacing the product , '' he_says 0 . `` when a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with wang . '' for mr. tait , who says_0 he used to earn as_much as $_150,000 a year at wang , it was one more reason 0 to quit . he is now president of eastate homes inc. , an indianapolis contractor . it can_be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement . brian petre , a former wang salesman in upstate new_york , says : `` you have pride in your job . you think_0 you_can go out and turn things around . it 's a tough thing when_you ca_n't . the reason does_n't relate to your selling skills . '' discouragement feeds on itself . `` the problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling , ''_says mike durcan , a laid-off sales manager in wang_'s austin office . one key for salespeople is to boost their_own morale . paul hellman , a framingham , mass. , sales and management consultant and author of `` ready , aim , you_'re hired , ''_says : `` the bad_news is , you_'ll be rejected more . the good_news is , it 's not your fault . '' so , he advises 0 , make goals achievable . for_instance , he suggests_that salespeople making telephone_calls should say to themselves : `` all 0 i want to do today is get 50 rejections . '' but mr._miller , wang_'s new president , recently warned his salespeople about negativism . `` our_customers watch us for the hidden message , '' he said . `` look a customer right in the eye and say , ` i_'m glad to be at wang .
