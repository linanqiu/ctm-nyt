two japanese scientists said_0 they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills aids-infected cells while preserving healthy cells . if further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired_immune deficiency_syndrome . the drug azt , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of aids , not to cure it . but several analysts and japanese scientists familiar_with the study , which was announced at a conference in nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . and the researchers themselves acknowledged 0 they still must do much more work before they_can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . shin yonehara , a research scientist at the tokyo metropolitan institute of medical science , said_0 the antibody 0 he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . the antibody then kills the cell . dr. yonehara and his partner , nobuyuki kobayashi of yamaguchi university , said_0 their experiments showed that the antibody wiped_out an_average of 60_% of aids-infected cells within three_days . in some of the experiments , it killed almost_all the infected cells , the researchers said_0 . meanwhile , fewer_than 10_% of the healthy cells were killed . the two said_0 they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . they said_0 they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the u.s. by late next_year . japan does_n't have enough aids patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said_0 . the announcement got wide exposure in the japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . but takashi kitamura , director of the biology department at japan 's national_institute of health and secretary of the government 's aids-research center , said , ``_i 'm_not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . '' he said_0 some infected cells may_not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody . `` the results seem to be very premature , '' said mitsuru miyata , editor of nikkei biotechnology , a leading japanese industry newsletter . dr. kobayashi responded that he thought_0 the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . but he and dr. yonehara said_0 there_were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side_effects . `` our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said dr. yonehara . ``_we do_n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . '' aids is n't considered a widespread problem in japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent_years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . dr. kitamura said_0 about 35 projects are currently under_way in japan , and that japanese researchers in the past year have made_available three possible cures to american researchers for clinical tests . he said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in january in new_orleans , the japanese will present at_least three more drugs for human testing . azt is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease . wellcome plc , a major british pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name retrovir . a wellcome spokesman_declined to comment_on the discovery of the antibody in japan . but andrew porter , a drug-industry analyst_at nikko_securities co. in london , said_0 if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of retrovir .
