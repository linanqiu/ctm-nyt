the crowning moment in the career of joseph f. o'kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant , marble-columned courtroom here last_year for his swearing in as president judge of cambria_county . baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench . the local american legion color guard led the way . as the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe , he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare . to many , it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern allegheny mountains . but then judge_o'kicki often behaved like a man_who would_be king -- and , some say , an arrogant and abusive one . while his case may_be extreme , it reflects the vulnerability of many_small communities to domineering judges . last_march , nine_months after the judge 's swearing-in , the state_attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array_of charges alleging more_than 10_years of `` official oppression '' in cambria_county , a depressed steel and mining community in western pennsylvania . the allegations , ranging_from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness , paint a disquieting picture . according_to testimony in a public , 80-page grand-jury report handed up to the state_attorney general , judge_o'kicki extorted cash from lawyers , muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more_than a decade . prosecutors , in an indictment based_on the grand_jury 's report , maintain that at various times since 1975 , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship ; plotted hidden ownership interests in real_estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set_up a dummy corporation 0 to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend -lrb- now his second wife -rrb- ; and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in cambria_county . in testimony recorded in the grand_jury report , court employees said_0 the judge , now 59 years_old , harassed his secretaries , made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone_who crossed him . bailiffs claimed 0 they_were required to chauffeur him to and from work , mow his lawn , chop his wood , fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts , dixie and husky . one former bailiff charged that the judge double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $_500 bribe . some of the allegations are simply bizarre . two former secretaries told the grand_jury 0 they_were summoned to the judge 's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation , only to find the judge in his bikini underwear . one secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all . the judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this_week , vehemently denies all the allegations against_him , calling them `` ludicrous '' and `` imaginative , political demagoguery . '' he blames the indictment on local political feuding , unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them . ``_i do_n't know whose toes i_'ve stepped on , ''_says the judge . ``_i 'll find_out , eventually , who pushed the state police buttons into action . '' even_if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities . that power can sometimes be abused , particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve_as corrective measures in urban areas . lawyers and their_clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . fear of alienating that judge is pervasive , says_0 maurice geiger , founder and director of the rural justice center in montpelier , vt. , a public_interest group that researches rural justice issues . as a result , says_0 mr. geiger , lawyers think twice before appealing a judge 's ruling , are_reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against_him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge 's integrity . judge_o'kicki , a stern and forbidding-looking man , has_been a fixture in the local legal community for more_than two_decades . the son of an immigrant stonemason of slovenian descent , he was raised in a small borough outside ebensburg , the cambria_county seat , and put himself through the university of pittsburgh law_school . he graduated near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with richard thornburgh , who went on to become governor of pennsylvania and , now , u.s._attorney general . it was also in law_school that mr. o'kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters . he divorced his first wife three_years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk . last_year , pennsylvania supreme_court justice john p. flaherty called mr. o'kicki one of the finest judges `` not_only in pennsylvania but in the united_states . '' clearly , the judge has had his share of accomplishments . after practicing law locally , he was_elected to his first 10-year term as judge in 1971 ; in 1981 , he was effectively re-elected . six_years ago , judge_o'kicki was voted president of the pennsylvania conference of state trial judges by the state 's 400 judges . he has_been considered several_times for appointments to federal_district and appellate_court vacancies in pennsylvania . and when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate_court seat in_1983 , the pennsylvania bar_association rated him `` one of the best available , '' after interviewing local lawyers . `` he probably was the smartest guy_who ever sat on our bench , ''_says a former_president of cambria_county 's 150-member bar_association , who , like most lawyers in cambria_county , refuses to talk_about the judge publicly . `` he 's sharp as a tack . he could grasp an issue with the blink of an_eye . '' for more_than a decade , virtually no_one complained about judge_o'kicki . `` what about those institutions that are supposed_to be the bedrock of society , the banks and the bar_association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the tribune-democrat , a newspaper in nearby johnstown , shortly_after the scandal became public . `` if only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years_ago , the judicial process would n't be under the taint 0 it is today . '' officials with the pennsylvania judicial inquiry and review board , the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct , counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in ebensburg . `` nobody told us ; nobody called us , ''_says an_official close to the case who asked_not to be named . `` nobody had the guts 0 to complain . '' certainly_not the lawyers . johnstown attorney richard_j. green jr. shelled out $_500 in loans to the judge over five_years , he said_0 in testimony to the grand_jury . `` the judge never made a pretense of repaying the money , '' said mr._green . eventually , mr._green testified 0 , he began ducking out of his office rather_than face the judge when he visited . when mr._green won a $ 240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in june 1983 , he_says 0 judge_o'kicki unexpectedly awarded him an_additional $_100,000 . mr._green thought little of it , he told the grand_jury 0 , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback . `` do_n't you think_0 i ought_to get a commission ... or part_of your fee in this case ? '' mr._green said_0 the judge asked him . appalled , mr._green never paid the money , he testified 0 . but he did_n't complain to the state 's judicial inquiry and review board , either , saying later that he feared retribution . mr. o'kicki said_0 he will respond to mr._green 's allegation at his trial . like most of cambria_county 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , mr._green declined to be_interviewed for this_article . and no_one with a complaint about the judge would_allow his_name to be printed . ``_i do_n't have anything much 0 to say , and i_think 0 that 's what you_'re going_to find from everyone_else 0 you talk to up here , ''_says local attorney edward f. peduzzi . says another lawyer : `` the practice of law is a matter of biting one 's lip when_you live in a small community . one had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut . '' the judge was considered imperious , abrasive and ambitious , those_who practiced before him say_0 . he sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench , while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom . four_years ago , he jailed all nine members of the cambria_county school board for several hours after they defied his order to extend the school year by several_weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike . visitors in his chambers say_0 he could cite precisely the years , months , weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge , giving judge_o'kicki the seniority required to take_over as the county 's top court administrator . the judge , they say_0 , was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments . `` my name is judge , '' judge_o'kicki told a car salesman in ebensburg when he bought a new red pontiac sunbird in october 1984 , according_to the grand-jury report . the dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name `` judge_o'kicki . '' yet , despite the judge 's imperial bearing , no_one ever had reason 0 to suspect possible wrongdoing , says_0 john bognato , president of cambria_county 's 150-member bar_association . `` the arrogance of a judge , his demeanor , the way_0 he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint , ''_says mr. bognato . `` until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' state investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in cambria_county . the judge came under scrutiny in late 1987 , after the state_attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in cambria_county . the inquiry soon focused_on the judge . even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according_to the grand_jury report . when the judge bought his new sunbird from james_e. black pontiac-cadillac in ebensburg five_years ago , the dealership had `` certain apprehensions '' about the judge 's reputation , according_to the grand-jury report . the dealership took the extra step of having all the paper_work for the transaction pre-approved by ebensburg 's local lender , laurel bank . then , as an_additional precaution , the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had_received the loan documents . but when the judge received his payment book , he disavowed the deal . `` there was no loan , there_is no loan , there never shall_be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery , according_to the report . later , the judge went a step farther . after laurel bank tried_to repossess the car , a vice_president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account . the judge wrote again . ``_i find myself in an adversary relationship_with laurel bank , and i_am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand_jury 's report . `` perhaps if my personal matters can_be resolved with laurel bank in the near_future , i may_be inclined to reconsider your request ... . '' the judge now says_0 it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to extort there . '' the bank acquiesced . it refinanced the judge 's loan , lowered_its interest_rate and accepted a trade-in that had n't originally been part_of the deal -- a beat up 1981 chevy citation 0 the dealer had to repair before it could_be resold . the incident was n't the only time 0 the judge got special treatment from his local bank . two_years later , he wrote to complain that the interest 0 he was paying on an unsecured $_10,000 loan was `` absolutely onerous . '' paul l. kane , laurel 's president at the time , quickly responded . the bank , he wrote back 0 , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by 3.5_% , `` as a concession to you . '' the judge says_0 he ca_n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he_contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe , he would_be far wealthier than he is . his seven-bedroom cedar and brick house outside of johnstown is up for sale to pay for his lawyers . the judge says_0 he is confident 0 he will return to his old bench . already , he notes 0 , the 76 charges originally filed against_him have_been trimmed to 27 . most of the allegations no_longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as_part of a pre-trial agreement . the heart of the case -- `` official oppression '' -- remains intact . `` if i lose , i lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , ''_says the judge . `` my god and i_know 0 i_am correct and innocent .
