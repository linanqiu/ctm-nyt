british_aerospace plc and france_'s thomson-csf s.a. said_0 they_are nearing an_agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors . the 50-50 joint_venture , which may_be dubbed eurodynamics , would_have combined annual_sales of at_least # 1.4_billion -lrb- $ 2.17 billion -rrb- and would_be among the world 's_largest missile makers . after two_years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british_government clearance . the companies hope for a final agreement by year-end . the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two_companies , and help make_them a leading force in european defense contracting . in recent_months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint_ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of european arms manufacture . already , british_aerospace and french government-controlled thomson-csf collaborate on a british missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system . just last_week they announced 0 they may make a joint bid to buy ferranti international signal plc , a smaller british defense_contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit . the sudden romance of british_aerospace and thomson-csf -- traditionally bitter competitors for middle_east and third_world weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in western_europe 's defense industry . most threatened by closer british aerospace-thomson ties would_be their_respective national rivals , including matra s.a. in france and britain_'s general_electric co. plc . but neither matra nor gec -- unrelated to stamford , conn.-based general_electric co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces . yesterday , a source close to gec confirmed_that his company may join the ferranti fight , as_part of a possible consortium that would bid against british_aerospace and thomson-csf . companies with which gec has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include matra , britain_'s dowty group_plc , west_germany 's daimler-benz ag , and france_'s dassault group . but it may_be weeks before gec and its potential partners decide_whether to bid , the source indicated 0 . gec plans first to study ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said_0 included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a u.s. unit , international signal & control group , with which ferranti merged last_year . also , any gec bid might_be blocked by british antitrust_regulators ; ferranti is gec 's main competitor on several_key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by gec may heighten british defense ministry worries_about concentration in the country 's defense industry . a consortium bid , however , would diminish gec 's direct role in ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials . a british_aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with gec for ferranti : `` competition is the name of the game , '' she said . at_least one potential gec partner , matra , insists 0 it is n't interested_in ferranti . ``_we have nothing 0 to say about this affair , which does_n't concern us , '' a matra official said sunday . the missile venture , the british_aerospace spokeswoman_said 0 , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . for both thomson and british_aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under_pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and middle_east sales , a traditional mainstay for both_companies ' exports , have_been hurt_by five_years of weak oil_prices . the venture 's importance for thomson is great . thomson feels 0 the future of its defense business depends_on building cooperation with other europeans . the european defense industry is consolidating ; for_instance , west_germany 's siemens ag recently joined gec in a takeover of britain_'s plessey co. , and daimler-benz agreed_to buy messerschmitt-boelkow blohm g.m.b . h . in missiles , thomson is already overshadowed by british_aerospace and by its home rival , france_'s aerospatiale s.a. ; to better compete , thomson officials_say 0 , they need a partnership . to justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , thomson would make a cash payment to british_aerospace . annual_revenue of british_aerospace 's missile business is about # 950 million , a thomson spokesman_said 0 . british_aerospace 's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of rapier surface-to-air missiles . thomson missile products , with about_half british_aerospace 's annual_revenue , include the crotale surface-to-air missile family .
