an unexpectedly sharp widening in the u.s._trade gap for august dragged the dollar lower tuesday , but profit-taking on short_positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts . while the market kept careful tabs on_wall street 's gyrations , it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well_above the day 's lows . soon_after the release of the u.s._trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday_low of 140.95 yen . it also declined against the mark but did_n't reach its intraday_low of 1.8435 marks until two_hours later . the unit stabilized about midday new_york time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen , prompting unconfirmed rumors_that the u.s. federal_reserve had intervened to blunt the unit 's tumble . the dollar_finished at its intraday highs . dealers noted_that the foreign_exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the u.s._trade figures was tempered later by a `` calmer reassessment of the data . '' the u.s. commerce_department reported a $_10.77 billion deficit in_august , compared_with a revised july deficit of $ 8.24 billion . economists had expected a $ 9.1 billion gap . the august figure reflected a 6.4_% rise in imports and a 0.2_% drop in exports . marc m. goloven , an_economist with manufacturers_hanover trust in new_york , said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating u.s._trade performance , there 's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars . he said that while the u.s._trade gap with canada has widened significantly , the trade_deficit with western_europe and japan continues to narrow . and he_added that manufactured goods exports are still rising . the dollar 's near-term path remains foggy , according_to currencny analysts , who characterize the market as `` bewildering . '' in late new_york trading_yesterday , the dollar was_quoted at 1.8667 marks , down from 1.8685 marks_late monday , and at 142.75_yen , up from 141.85 yen_late monday . sterling was_unchanged at $ 1.5753 . in tokyo wednesday , the u.s._currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen , unchanged from tuesday 's tokyo_close . later , the u.s._currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the san_francisco earthquake . some_analysts remain bullish and point_out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate_increases in europe and japan , several_weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $ 12 billion -- and a 190-point_plunge on the new_york stock_exchange . they note that the u.s. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the group of seven trading partners . the g-7 comprises west_germany , the u.s. , france , the u.k. , italy , canada and japan . the so-called louvre accord was seen to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140_yen . they say that the recent injection of liquidity into the u.s. banking_system has_been modest , and they do_n't anticipate significant easing by the u.s. federal_reserve . the fed arranged $_1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements tuesday , the second repurchase agreement in two_days . the move , which injects capital into the system , is seen as an_effort to reassure the finanicial markets that the u.s. central_bank is ready to provide the ample liquidity . but other analysts contend_that while the fed 's move to loosen credit has n't been aggressive , it nevertheless sends a clear signal that , at_least for now , the fed has relaxed its grip_on credit . they add that the fed has allowed the key federal_funds interest_rate to dip to about 8_5\/8 % from its levels of just below 9_% last_week . the federal_funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each_other . market_participants said that the mark continues to post the most significant gains against the dollar . on the commodity_exchange in new_york , gold for current_delivery settled_at $ 367.40 an_ounce , up 10_cents . estimated_volume was a moderate 3.5_million ounces . in early_trading in hong_kong wednesday , gold was at $ 366.55 an_ounce .
