in a nondescript office building south of los_angeles , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated . a squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand-held computers register their second-by-second reactions to a speaker 's remarks . agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can_be inferred from the subjects ' twist of a dial . in another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they_can be reshaped . donald vinson , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white-coated researcher . he heads litigation_sciences inc. , the nation_'s largest legal consulting_firm , which is helping corporate_america prepare_for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions . in the process , litigation_sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law . little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , litigation_sciences , a unit of saatchi_& saatchi plc , employs more_than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians . twenty-one of its workers are ph. d.s . among_other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics . much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation advisers encourage their_clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving 0 to make the desired choice . with jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing_to pay huge sums for such advice . recently , litigation_sciences helped pennzoil co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against texaco inc . it advised the national football_league in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the united_states football_league . and it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products , ranging_from firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug bendectin . largely as a result , litigation_sciences has more_than doubled in size in the past_two years . its 1988 revenue was $ 25 million . meanwhile , competitors are_being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up . mr._vinson estimates 0 the industry 's total revenues approach $_200 million . in any high-stakes case , you_can be_sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants . despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome . some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the american jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen . in the film classic `` twelve angry men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict . after hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity . in real life , jurors may_not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do_so rather_than be programmed not to . litigation consulting is , as new_york trial attorney donald zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . '' he_adds , `` the notion 0 they try_to sell is that juries do_n't make decisions rationally . but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally . i find it troubling . '' but mr. zoeller also acknowledges_that consultants can_be very effective . `` it 's gotten to the point_where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he_says . others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . `` the affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -lcb- in political cases -rcb- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind_of system 0 we_want , ''_says amitai etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at george washington university . sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . the harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which daniel berrigan and others were_charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark . in that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around harrisburg . the researchers discovered that episcopalians , presbyterians , methodists and fundamantalist protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try_to keep them off the jury . the defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the vietnam war . a more blue-collar panel became a second aim . ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote 0 to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case . litigation consulting had arrived . the fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when international_business machines_corp. hired a marketing professor 0 to help defend a complex antitrust case . the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas barr and david boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable . as the trial progressed , they_were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them . the solution devised by the professor was to hire six people_who would mirror the actual jury demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him . he then briefed messrs. boies and barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly . thus , the `` shadow '' jury was_born . mr._vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed litigation_sciences . -lrb- ibm won the case . -rrb- `` the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , ''_says mr. boies of cravath , swaine & moore . `` what you_look for in a shadow jury is very_much what you_do when_you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it . a shadow jury is a way_0 to do that in a more systematic and organized way . '' the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which energy transportation systems_inc. sued santa_fe pacific_corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind_of case likely_to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over . energy transportation retained litigation_sciences , at a cost of several_hundred thousand dollars , 0 to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow . just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $_150 a day . the jurors , who did_n't know which side had retained them , decided for energy transportation , and awarded $_500 million in damages . the real jury returned days_later with a $ 345 million victory for energy transportation . `` it 's just like weather forecasting , ''_says energy transportation trial attorney harry reasoner of vinson & elkins . `` it 's often wrong , but it 's better_than consulting an indian rain dancer . '' forecasting is only one part_of litigation_sciences ' work . changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters . and to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative . theoretically , jurors are supposed_to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively . instead , mr._vinson says_0 , interviews with thousands_of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try_to shoe-horn the facts of the case 0 to fit their views . pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror . if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive_damages , for_example , depressed , underemployed people are far_more likely_to grant them . someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who_works in a deli would_be ideal , litigation_sciences advises 0 . so would someone recently divorced or widowed . -lrb- since litigation_sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -rrb- for personal-injury cases , litigation_sciences seeks defense jurors who believe_that most people , including victims , get what they deserve . such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women . the consultants help the defense_lawyers find such jurors by asking questions_about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books . litigation_sciences does_n't make moral distinctions . if a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will_help find them . as mr._vinson explains it , ``_we do_n't control the facts . they_are what they_are . but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy 0 to employ . in our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case 0 he possibly can . '' once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are_likely to be and help shape the lawyers_' presentation accordingly . logic plays a minimal role here . more_important are what lsi calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . in one personal-injury case , a woman claimed 0 she had_been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did_n't explain_why one of her arms was discolored bluish . by repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense_lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries . the ploy worked . the defense won . in a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate_on encouraging the jury to shift the blame . `` the ideal defense in a case_involving an_accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible_for his or her plight , '' mr._vinson has written . slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in litigation_sciences ' operation . studies show , the consultants say_0 , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if_they receive it visually . computer-generated videos help . `` the average american watches seven hours of tv a day . they_are very visually sophisticated , '' explains lsi graphics specialist robert seltzer . lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this . supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist_that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics . `` they may_not have_been able_to articulate it all , but they_did it , ''_says stephen gillers , a legal ethics expert at new_york university law_school . `` what you have here is intuition made manifest . '' many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no_one tampers with the evidence . others point_out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage . litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome . litigation_sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions . a few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -lrb- not at litigation_sciences -rrb- $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in the american lawyer magazine . some litigators scoff at the notion_that a sociologist knows more_than they do about what makes a jury tick . `` the essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , ''_says barry ostrager of simpson thacher & bartlett , who recently won a huge case on_behalf of insurers against shell_oil co . he_says 0 he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . '' but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken . and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage . for more_than a decade , mr. etzioni , the sociologist , has_been a leading critic of the masseurs . `` there 's no_reason 0 to believe_that juries rule inappropriately , '' he_says . `` but the last thing 0 you_want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make_them think better . what you then do is 0 you make_them think inappropriately . '' to hamper the work of litigation scientists , he suggests_that courts sharply limit the number_of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do_n't require explanations . in most civil_cases , judges allow each side three such challenges . for complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more . mr. etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information_about the jurors . -lrb- some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit_ratings , and even question neighbors . -rrb- furthermore , he_says 0 , psychologists should not be_allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . mr. boies , the first lawyer 0 to use mr._vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -lrb- known_as voir dire -rrb- or giving out personal information_about the jurors . `` the more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind_of research to be effective , and i_do n't_think 0 courts should lend themselves to that , '' mr. boies says .
