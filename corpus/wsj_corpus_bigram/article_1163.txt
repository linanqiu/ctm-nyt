many skittish mutual_fund investors picked_up the phone yesterday , but decided not to cash in their chips after all . as the stock_market bounced_back , withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted_to a mere trickle compared_with black_monday , when investors_dumped $_2.3 billion , or about 2_% of stock-fund assets . fidelity_investments , the nation_'s largest fund company , said_0 phone volume_was more_than double its typical level , but still half that of oct._19 , 1987 . net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood_at less_than $_300 million , or below 15_% of the $_2 billion cash_position of the firm 's stock portfolios . much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds . outflows since the close of trading_friday remain below one-third their level of two_years ago , fidelity said_0 . other mutual_fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests . and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day . `` two_years ago , there was a_lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone , '' said kathryn mcgrath , head of the investment_management division of the securities and exchange_commission . this time , ``_we do_n't have that at all . '' of course , the relative calm could_be jolted if the market plunges again . and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise_cash , as some did during black_monday . but funds generally are better prepared this time around . as a group , their cash_position of 10.2 % of assets in_august -- the latest figure available -- is 14_% higher_than two_years earlier . many fund_managers have boosted their cash levels in recent_weeks . the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day . vanguard_group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone_lines opened at 8:30 a.m . `` in the first hour , the real nervous folks came along , '' a spokesman_said . `` but the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably . '' at scudder , stevens & clark inc. , phone_calls came in at 40_% more_than the normal pace through early afternoon . most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone_lines opened at 8 a.m . as stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell_orders . many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading . at scudder and at the smaller ivy funds group in hingham , mass. , for_instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the switches . because mutual_fund trades do_n't take_effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put . at fidelity 's office in downtown boston , gerald sherman walked in shortly_after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement_accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund . but by 3:15 p.m. , with the market comfortably ahead for the day , mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch . `` it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized , '' said mr. sherman , the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department_store . but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk , high-yield_junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines . shareholders have_been steadily bailing out of several big junk_funds the past_several weeks as the $_200 billion market was jolted by a cash_crunch at campeau_corp. and steadily declining prices . much of the money has_been switched into money market funds , fund executives_say 0 . instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests . this avoids knocking down prices further . the $_1.1 billion t._rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis , says_0 george j. collins , president of t._rowe price associates inc . that way , mr. collins says , ``_we did_n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market . '' when the market stabilized , he_added 0 , the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back . tom herman contributed_to this_article .
