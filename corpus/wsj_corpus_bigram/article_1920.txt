the new_york mercantile_exchange , the world 's chief oil futures marketplace , is at a critical juncture . several longtime observers of the commodities industry think_0 the fortunes of the merc over the next decade will_be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural_gas futures_contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor_traders with exchange and commodity_futures trading commission rules . if the exchange falters in these moves , they say_0 , it might once_again fall behind its chief new_york competitor , the commodity_exchange . on friday , the merc 's board announced that it had approved sabine pipe line co. 's henry hub in erath , la. , as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural_gas futures_contract . it also said that it would start trading the contract as_soon as the cftc approved it . the cftc has 90_days 0 to respond to such applications . the merc first started working on developing this contract in 1984 . only three_weeks earlier , the merc had turned to one of its_own executives , 40-year-old r. patrick thompson , to replace rosemary t. mcfadden as president . mr._thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the merc 's tarnished reputation_as an exchange whose floor_traders do_n't follow the rules very_well . ms. mcfadden had_been forced out in july in a bitter power struggle with z. lou guttman , chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange . mr. guttman told one_person familiar_with the new_york exchanges during the search_for a replacement that he was looking_for a president who would_be `` responsive to the needs of the membership and the board . '' mr._thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has_been executive_vice president since march 1988 . he previously held posts of senior_vice president of compliance and senior_vice president and general_counsel . by_contrast , the comex in july imported a highly regarded outsider , arnold f. staloff , as its president . mr. staloff , 44 , was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock_exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products . mr._thompson is n't bereft of experience with new products , however . for the past_two years , he said_0 , he and the exchange 's research department have_been working on the new natural_gas contract , seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural_gas market . `` our members are eager to begin trading this contract , so we_expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural_gas pit , '' he said_0 . the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural_gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would_have to continue for another a year or two , he_added 0 . the merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude_oil , gasoline and heating_oil have made it the largest futures exchange in new_york , and third behind the chicago_board of trade and chicago_mercantile exchange . in a recent interview , mr._thompson said_0 the biggest problem facing all commodity_exchanges was one of image . earlier_this year , the u.s._attorney indicted 45 floor_traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges . federal authorities in new_york started investigating exchanges in may , though no indictments have_been handed down there . so_far they have issued scores of subpoenas , some of which went to members of the new_york merc . mr._thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas . in a recent general accounting_office study , the merc was found to have_been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules . it levied the smallest number_of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity_exchanges studied over the past_five years . it also had both the fewest , and least experienced , investigators per million contracts traded . the merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director , kevin p. conway , who then was responsible_for policing the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits , `` was engaged_in other personal business activities on exchange time , '' including out-of-state trips , according_to a new_york merc report prepared last_year . mr. conway is no_longer at the exchange . ``_we had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance , '' mr._thompson says . ``_we recognized the problem and took care of it . '' he_says that even_if the natural_gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly , the 1990 business plan calls_for having adequate compliance people 0 to ensure_that exchange rules are_being followed . for years the five new_york exchanges have_been talking_about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations . periodically , there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges . so_far there_is little 0 to show for such efforts . mr._thompson believes_0 the case for working together is stronger now than_ever . `` the cost of competition has_become extremely high , '' he_says . ``_we must find ways_0 to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges . '' he_thinks that progress in cooperation can_be made in areas where no vested_interests have built up . one of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would_permit floor_traders to enter trades as they make_them . the gao has recommended the creation of a system 0 to record trade data so that an_independent , verifiable audit trail can_be established to prevent customer fraud . the merc is now cooperating with the comex in developing such a device 0 to provide such an audit trail . the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device . another major electronics problem faces mr._thompson -- the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can_be used outside normal trading hours . in january , the new_york merc signed a letter of intent with the chicago merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system 0 called globex . but in may , the chicago merc said_0 it was looking into creating a common system with the chicago_board of trade , and it suspended negotiations_with the new_york merc . mr._thompson says_0 his exchange is n't waiting_for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation . it recently began a pilot program 0 to test an electronic trading system called ats\/2 , the automated trading system created_by the international commodities clearing house . looking_ahead to commodity_markets this_week : copper michael frawley , metals trader for painewebber_inc. in new_york , said_0 there_is good technical support between $_1.10 and $_1.12 a pound for december copper , which ended friday at $ 1.1580 a pound , up 1.6 cents . he views the $_1.10 to $_1.12 range as a buying_opportunity and considers the market oversold . ``_i think_0 the market could pop up to the $_1.22 to $_1.25 level without too_much difficulty , '' he said . but he said_0 it wo_n't climb further and he_expects it to remain in a trading range between $_1.10 and $_1.25 . he_noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this_week and traders should keep an_eye on_wall street . william o'neill , research_director for elders futures inc. in new_york , said_0 for a rally to occur , there must_be demand from the far_east . he_added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has_been fully discounted . however , to resume the bull trend , according_to mr. o'neill , copper would_have to close over $_1.19 . he said_0 there_are two reports this_week that might affect prices : the purchasing_managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday . precious_metals friday_'s strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious_metals markets , according_to painewebber 's mr. frawley . `` most traders will_be looking to buy -lcb- on -rcb- pullbacks , '' he said . he thought the moves in the metals last_week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial_markets . according_to mr. frawley , floor_traders say_0 there_is good support for december gold in the $ 374 to $ 375 per ounce area , around $ 5.20 an_ounce for december_silver and in the $ 485 to $ 490 an_ounce range for january_platinum . william o'neill , research_director for elders futures inc. in new_york , said the price action for all of last_week is the best 0 he has seen on a weekly basis in more_than a year . he said_0 last_week 's activity in gold could portend a move to $ 390 an_ounce for the december_contract . he also said_0 traders should keep an_eye on the stock_market , because `` if the stock_market rallies , that could spell trouble for the precious_metals . '' he said_0 traders should_be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally . ``_i expect to see some selling , but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past '' by selling and locking in prices for their production ? he_noted that for the first_time in months there was some light investor_interest in the metals . grains and soybeans prices this_week will likely be dominated_by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as_well as by speculation about more purchases of u.s. crops by the soviet_union . in recent_weeks , warm and dry weather has sped the midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the 1988 drought . if the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend , many midwest grain_elevators will_probably sell futures_contracts today at the chicago_board of trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers . that selling of futures_contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure_on crop prices during the harvest . traders will also watch for whether the soviet_union continues its traditional fall buying of u.s. grain . so_far this_month , the soviets have bought about 7.2 million metric_tons of u.s._corn . there may_be some activity in soybean prices this_week as investors try_to get_rid of the contract for november_delivery . investors usually do_n't want to take physical delivery of a contract , preferring instead to profit from its price_swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration .
