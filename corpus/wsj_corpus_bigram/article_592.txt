senate_democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains_tax have decided , under_pressure from their leaders , not to offer their_own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of president_bush 's legislative priority . a core group of six or so democratic_senators has_been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets . the plan was complete except_for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would_be unveiled as early as yesterday . but senate_majority leader_george mitchell_-lrb- d. , maine_-rrb- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains_tax cut , called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday . sen._mitchell urged them to desist . afterward , leaders of the dissident democrats relented , and said_0 they would n't offer their_own proposal as they had planned . the decision is a setback for president_bush , who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax_cut through the democratic-controlled senate . having a proposal sponsored_by democrats would_have given the president an advantage . having only a republican measure makes the task harder . still , sen. bob packwood -lrb-_r. , ore. -rrb- , the lead sponsor of the republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax_cut would_be enacted this_year . he said_0 a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would_be enough senators 0 to overcome any procedural hurdle 0 the democratic_leadership might erect . but sen._mitchell , buoyed_by his victory among fellow democrats , strongly disagreed . mr. mitchell has_been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this_year . yesterday , in an_interview , he_added that the democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains_tax cut will not pass this_year . '' mr. mitchell 's first victory came last_week , when the senate passed a deficit-reduction_bill that did_n't contain a capital-gains_provision . that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains_tax cut would_be included in the final bill , now being drafted by house and senate negotiators . the house_version of the bill does include the tax_cut . now republican leaders are concentrating_on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction_legislation . to help lay the groundwork for that fight , president_bush plans early_next week to meet at the white_house with some 20 democratic_senators who favor cutting the capital-gains_tax or are undecided on the issue . the president apparently will have only one bill 0 to push , sen. packwood 's , and at_least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it . ``_i may want to offer additional amendments 0 to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said sen. david_boren -lrb-_d. , okla. -rrb- , a leader of those democrats . the packwood_plan , as expected , would_allow individuals to exclude from income 5_% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more_than one year . the exclusion would rise five percentage_points for each year 0 the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35_% after seven_years . the exclusion would_apply to assets sold after oct._1 . as an_alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . for corporations , the top tax_rate on the sale of assets held for more_than three_years would_be cut to 33_% from the current top rate of 34_% . that rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15_years . the packwood_plan also would include a proposal , designed by sen. william roth -lrb-_r. , del. -rrb- , that would_create new tax_benefits for individual_retirement accounts . the roth plan would_create a new , non-deductible ira from which money could_be withdrawn tax-free not_only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses . current iras could_be rolled over into the new iras , but would_be subject to tax though no penalty .
