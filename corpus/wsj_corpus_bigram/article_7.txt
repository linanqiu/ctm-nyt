israel has launched a new effort to prove 0 the palestine liberation organization continues to practice terrorism , and thus to persuade the u.s. to break off talks_with the group . u.s. officials , however , said_0 they_are n't buying the israeli argument . israeli counterterrorism officials provided the state_department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents 0 they attribute directly to forces controlled_by plo chairman yasser arafat . mr. arafat publicly renounced terrorism dec._15 , satisfying the u.s. precondition for a direct `` dialogue '' with the plo . a u.s. counterterrorism official said_0 experts are studying the israeli list . ``_we have no independent evidence linking fatah to any acts of terrorism since dec._15 , 1988 , '' he said , referring_to the specific plo group that mr. arafat heads . `` so_far , this list does_n't change our view . israel wants to end the dialogue , but our analysts take a different view than theirs . '' israeli prime_minister yitzhak shamir 's top adviser on counterterrorism , yigal carmon , was here monday to present the report to members of congress , reporters and others . mr. carmon said_0 he also presented the list last_week to william brown , u.s._ambassador to israel . separately , the new_york times reported that the israeli government had provided its correspondent in jerusalem with different documents that israel said_0 prove 0 the plo has_been conducting terrorism from the occupied arab territories . the state_department said_0 it has n't_yet seen copies of those papers . `` if the dialogue was based_on the assumption that arafat or the plo would stop terrorism , and we have evidence of continued terrorism , what would_be the logical conclusion ? '' mr. carmon asked . israel has long claimed 0 mr. arafat never meant to renounce terrorism , particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press `` armed struggle '' against the jewish state . now , jerusalem says_0 it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to mr. arafat . it blames most of these on fatah . the new accusations come at a delicate time in u.s. efforts to bring about talks_between israel and palestinian representatives . the state_department said_0 it had_received a new letter on the subject from israeli foreign_minister moshe arens , restating israel 's previous objection to negotiating_with any palestinian tied to the plo . deciding what constitutes `` terrorism '' can_be a legalistic exercise . the u.s. defines it as `` premediated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents . '' to meet the u.s. criteria , israel contended 0 it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders . at the heart of israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents 0 jerusalem attributes to fatah , including the use of bombs and molotov cocktails . but u.s. officials_say 0 they_are n't satisfied 0 these incidents constitute terrorism because_they may_be offshoots of the intifadah , the palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories , which the u.s. does_n't classify as terrorism . in_addition , the officials_say 0 israel has n't presented convincing evidence 0 these acts were ordered by fatah or by any group 0 mr. arafat controls . u.s. terrorism experts also say_0 they_are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the new_york times . the papers , which israel says_0 were discovered in israeli-occupied gaza , refer to terrorist acts 0 to be carried_out in the name of a group called `` the revolutionary eagles . '' some supporters of israel say_0 u.s. policy on palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the plo . but state_department officials accuse israel of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the u.s. .
