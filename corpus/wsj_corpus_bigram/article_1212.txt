u.s._trade representative_carla hills said_0 the first dispute-settlement panel set_up under the u.s.-canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled_that canada 's restrictions_on exports of pacific salmon and herring violate the accord . mrs._hills said_0 the u.s. and canada have until nov._13 to resolve the dispute . if a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the u.s. would_have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. fish-processing companies in alaska and the pacific northwest . however , in ottawa , canadian trade minister john crosbie said_0 the dispute-settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . '' questioned about the seeming contradiction in the u.s. and canadian_government views of the panel 's report , an_aide for mrs._hills said_0 the panel had clearly ruled_that the canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . '' the u.s._trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting_from the canadian export restrictions . canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in british_columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export . this action was defended by the canadian_government on conservation grounds . mrs._hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this canadian_government argument . ``_we fully expect that canada will comply_with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must_be ended , she said_0 . earlier , an international panel set_up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian fish-export restrictions violated gatt rules . mrs._hills said_0 the u.s. wo_n't accept any delays after nov._13 because u.s. fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch . she said_0 the canadian restrictions must_be removed before such contracts are concluded .
