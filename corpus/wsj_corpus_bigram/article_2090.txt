the big three u.s._auto makers posted losses in their core north_american automotive businesses for the third_quarter , and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price_wars are casting a pall_over the fourth period . the strongest sign of the big three 's woes came from ford_motor co. , which said_0 it had a loss in its u.s. automotive business for the first_time since 1982 . ford predicted 0 fourth-quarter_net income will fall_below the year-earlier level , partly_because of a likely $_500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations . the bleak automotive results_were offset_by strong_earnings from some non-automotive operations . still , the combined profit of ford , chrysler_corp. and general_motors corp. fell 44_% to $_1.02 billion from $ 1.83 billion a year_earlier , excluding a one-time_gain of $ 309 million at chrysler from the sale of mitsubishi motors_corp. stock . the last time 0 all three companies reported north_american automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982 . yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock_market . gm 's common_closed at $ 44.375 a_share , down 50_cents , ford fell 37.5_cents to end at $ 47.50 , and chrysler eased 37.5_cents to $ 22.25 , all in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . the market 's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in detroit . as japanese_auto makers gained market share , the big three , with gm in the lead , slashed north_american production and launched a retail discounting blitz . the price war peaked in the third_quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more_than $_1,000 a vehicle , according_to industry officials . gm probably had the `` heaviest incentives , '' said_0 robert s. miller , chrysler 's chief_financial officer . ``_we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them . '' but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains , and domestic_car sales have plunged 19_% since the big three ended many of their programs sept._30 . gm , ford and chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter u.s. output plans an_estimated 15_% from 1988 levels . if sales do_n't pick_up , the cuts will_go deeper and incentives will sprout again . ford , which has long boasted of its ability_to weather a downturn , saw earnings take a beating . the no._2 auto_maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market -- for a 44_% drop in net to $ 477.1 million , or $_1.03 a_share , on revenue of $ 20.24 billion . nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive_operations . the dearborn , mich. , auto_maker ran a loss of $ 37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the u.s. , a deterioration of $ 378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter . ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily_because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial_services . a year_earlier , ford reported record net of $ 856.3 million , or $ 1.78 a_share , on revenue of $ 20.38 billion . in the latest_nine months , ford earned_$ 3.52 billion , or $ 7.51 a_share , compared_with $ 4.14 billion , or $ 8.53 a_share . the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved_earnings until the 1989 second_quarter . but david n. mccammon , vice_president , finance , insisted_that cost-cutting and tight production_capacity will make results `` better in this downturn than in prior downturns , '' when ford had net losses . still , mr. mccammon said_0 ford expects the u.s._economy to weaken through the end of 1990 , causing weaker sales and production . as a result , fourth-quarter profit will come in below 1988 results , although the drop wo_n't be as sharp as the 44_% third-quarter decline , he said_0 . part_of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as_much as $_500 million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit . in the 1988 fourth_quarter , ford had net of $ 1.16 billion , or $ 2.42 a_share . chrysler 's operating_profit fell to a scant $ 22_million , or 10_cents a_share , its lowest quarterly total in seven_years . its $ 309 million , or $_1.32 a_share , gain from the sale of 75_million mitsubishi shares made net $ 331 million , or $_1.42 a_share . sales were_flat at $ 7.88 billion . the results_include record quarterly_earnings of $ 76 million from chrysler financial corp . a year_earlier , chrysler 's net was $ 113 million , or 50_cents a_share . mr._miller said_0 costs of incentives caused a `` moderate '' loss in the highland park , mich. , company 's north_american car and truck business . he said_0 the loss was n't `` that much different '' from ford 's $ 37 million loss on u.s. automotive_operations , but he declined to be specific . mr._miller said_0 chrysler spent an_average of $_1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third_quarter , compared_with about $_450 a vehicle a year_earlier -- a `` high-water mark '' at the time . he said_0 chrysler `` is no_longer sure '' of its forecast for industry car and truck_sales of 14.2 million in the 1990_model year . consumers , he said_0 , are balking at higher_prices on 1990 cars , especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on 1989 models . in the nine_months , net was $_1.02 billion , or $ 4.38 a_share , including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale , compared_with $ 617 million , or $ 2.77 a_share , after a charge of $ 93 million , or 42 cents_a share , for plant closings in the 1988_period . sales_rose 8.4 % to $ 27.95 billion from $ 25.78 billion . heavy losses in north_american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ 516.9 million from a record $ 859.2 million . detroit-based gm does_n't issue separate quarterly_earnings for the north_american automotive business . but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as_much as $_300 million on domestic vehicle operations . an 8.5_% drop in north_american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue , and rebates to dealers and customers more_than offset gains from price increases on 1990_model vehicles delivered during the period , a gm spokesman_said 0 . but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations . in one breakdown , gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units , electronic data_systems corp. and gm_hughes electronics corp . meanwhile , gm said_0 overseas auto operations are on track 0 to exceed last_year 's record full-year net of $_2.7 billion . the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves , exclusive of its financial subsidiary , to $ 5.5 billion as of sept._30 , a 22_% increase from a year_earlier . this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north_american production schedules more_than the already scheduled 9.5_% . under the circumstances , it wo_n't be easy for gm to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter_net of $_1.4 billion , the spokesman acknowledged 0 . that means 0 it 's unlikely 0 the company will surpass last_year 's $_4.9 billion full-year profit , even_though net for the first_nine months was up 1.9 % to $ 3.52 billion on revenue of $ 95.57 billion . it earned_$ 3.46 billion on revenue of $ 91.21 billion in the 1988 nine_months .
