pension_funds , insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said_0 they began scooping up stocks during friday_'s market rout . and they plan to buy more today . rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional_investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson 0 they learned in the october_1987 crash : buying at the bottom pays off . to be_sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply_lower today . they could still panic and bail_out of the market . but their 1987 performance indicates_that they wo_n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse . `` last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said john w. rogers , president of chicago-based ariel capital_management inc. , which manages $_1.1 billion of stocks . mr. rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for `` our favorite stocks that have_fallen apart . '' he_expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further . denver-based portfolio_manager james craig was n't daunted when friday_'s rout shaved $_40 million from the value of the $ 752 million janus fund 0 he oversees . ``_i waited to make_sure 0 all the program_trades had kicked through , '' he said . then he jumped into the market : ``_i spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . '' other money_managers also opened their wallets . ``_i was buying at the close -lrb- friday -rrb- and i_'ll be buying again because i_know 0 we_'re getting good value , '' said frederick a. moran , president of moran asset_management inc. , greenwich , conn . `` there_is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' unlike mutual_funds , which can_be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such_as pension_funds and insurance_companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $_1 trillion from pension_funds alone . `` if_you bought after the crash , you did very very_well off the bottom , '' said stephen b. timbers , chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper_financial services_inc . the $ 56 billion california public employees retirement system , for one , added $_1 billion to its stock portfolio two_years ago . `` the last crash taught institutional_investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca_n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said stephen l. nesbitt , senior_vice president for the pension consultants wilshire associates in santa_monica , calif . `` those that pulled_out -lrb- of stocks -rrb- regretted it , '' he said , `` so i doubt 0 you_'ll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of friday_'s decline . stocks , as measured_by the standard_& poor_'s 500-stock_index , have_been stellar performers this_year , rising 27.97 % before friday_'s plunge , excluding dividends . even friday_'s slump leaves investors ahead more_than 20_% , well_above the annual average for stocks over several decades . `` you could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said james d. awad , president of new_york-based bmi capital corp . mr. awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next_few days . it can_happen before you_can turn around . '' he said_0 he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis_on takeover_stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program_trading . `` the only_thing 0 you_do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio_insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . '' most institutional_investors have abandoned the portfolio_insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987_crash . not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock_prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p_futures contracts . in its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio_insurance in effect in the 1987_crash did_n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures_prices became disconnected . even without portfolio_insurance , market_conditions were grim friday , money_managers said_0 . neil weisman , whose new_york-based chilmark capital partners had converted 85_% of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent_months , said_0 he was besieged by wall_street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands . ``_we got calls from big block houses asking us if we_want to make bids on anything , '' said mr. weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined the offers . mr. weisman predicts 0 stocks will appear to stabilize in the next_few days before declining again , trapping more investors . ``_i think_0 it will_be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said . meanwhile , friday brought a reprieve for money_managers whose investment styles had put them at_odds with the market rally . especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have_been pounded by this_year 's market climb . the shorts sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . the nation_'s largest short-selling operation is feshbach brothers , palo_alto , calif. , which said last may that its short_positions had shown losses of 10_% for the year up to that point . all that now has_changed . ``_we 're ahead for the year because of friday , '' said the firm 's kurt feshbach . ``_we 're_not making a killing , but we had a good day .
