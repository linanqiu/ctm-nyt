the collapse of a $_6.79 billion buy-out of united_airlines parent_ual corp. has handed wall_street 's takeover_stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal . their $_700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $_400 million in paper losses 0 the takeover traders , known_as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when gulf oil co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for cities service co . in the six trading days since the ual labor-management_buy-out group failed to get bank_financing , culminating friday with the withdrawal of its partner british_airways plc , ual_stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 1\/2 from 285 1\/4 . the arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the ual_deal gets patched up again , as they_did in 1982 when occidental_petroleum co. rescued them with a $_4 billion takeover of cities service . in the meantime , the question faced by investors is : what is ual_stock worth ? the short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts_say 0 the stock is worth somewhere_between $ 135 and $_150 a_share . that 's based_on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10_times ual earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a_share this_year . airline_stocks typically sell at a discount of about_one-third to the stock_market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings . that 's because airline earnings , like those of auto_makers , have_been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy . that analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings . so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such_as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do_so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event . one_analyst , who asked_not to be_identified , said_0 he_believes that the ual pilots and management can put_together a bid `` in the $_225 area , '' but that it could take three to four_months to close . at that level , and given the uncertainty , he_believes 0 ual_stock should trade closer to other observers note that ual 's board , having accepted a bid of $_300 a_share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even_if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal . by that logic , the closing of a deal could_be much further away than three to four_months , even_though the eventual price might_be higher . investment_bankers following ual agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have_been attempting a buy-out for more_than two_years , and are n't likely_to stop , having come so close to success . the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $_200 million , and to commit $_200 million from their retirement funds . on friday , they also persuaded the ual flight_attendants to join them . however , investment_bankers say that banks are n't likely_to lend the almost $_5 billion that would_be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater_than the 17_% in cash put_up by investors in the leveraged takeover of northwest_airlines parent nwa corp. in july . banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank_debt in any deal . that way , they figure 0 , someone_else has an even stronger motivation 0 to make_sure 0 the deal is going_to work , because_they would_be losing their money before the banks lost theirs . banks also want to be_able to call someone 0 on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader . that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $_1 billion -- far_more than either they or the flight_attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone . one obstacle to the pilots_' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority_ownership . investors such_as marvin_davis of los_angeles who have sought airline ownership this_year have insisted 0 they , not the pilots , must have control . one way out of that dilemma could_be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind_up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders . the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy_back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control 0 they have_been seeking . but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . the lack_of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . in advising the ual_board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $_240 a_share from mr._davis , the investment_bank of first_boston came up with a wide_range of potential values for the company , depending_on appraisal methods and assumptions . using the the nwa takeover as a benchmark , first_boston on sept. 14 estimated that ual was worth $_250 to $ 344 a_share based_on ual 's results for the 12_months ending last_june 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based_on a management estimate of results for 1989 . first_boston 's estimates had_been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection . using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety_of scenarios , first_boston estimated ual 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a_share if its future labor_costs conform to wall_street projections ; $ 237 to $_275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at nwa ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike . and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets , first_boston estimated 0 the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a_share . unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month . american_airlines parent amr and usair_group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results . some_analysts do_n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots . the deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so_many moving parts . i_do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his_name associated_with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . '' in_addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists_union , the pilots_' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots_' deal ; and regulators in washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt . in the meantime , the arbs are bleeding . wall_street traders and analysts_estimate that takeover_stock traders own ual_stock and options equal to as many as 6.5_million shares , or about 30_% of the total outstanding . frank gallagher , an_analyst with phoenix capital corp. in new_york , estimates that the arbs paid an_average of about $_280 a_share for their ual positions . that would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on ual alone totalling $ 725 million . ual_corp . -lrb- nyse ; symbol : ual -rrb- business : airline year_ended dec._31 , 1988 : sales : $ 8.98 billion net_income \* : $ 599.9 million ; or $ 20.20 a_share second_quarter , june_30 , 1989 : per-share_earnings : $ 6.52 vs. $ 5.77 average_daily trading_volume : 881,969 shares common_shares outstanding : 21.6 million
