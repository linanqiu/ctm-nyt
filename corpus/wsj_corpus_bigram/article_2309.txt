as a presidential candidate in 1980 , george_bush forthrightly expressed his_position on abortion in an_interview with rolling stone magazine published that march . what did he think of the supreme_court 's decision legalizing abortion ? ``_i happen to think_0 it was right , '' mr._bush said flatly . a few_months later , mr._bush became ronald_reagan 's running mate . suddenly , george_bush the pro-choice advocate became george_bush the anti-abortionist . and the vacillation did_n't end there . just a month ago , mr._bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds , except to save a woman 's life . then , two_weeks ago -- declaring that ``_i 'm_not looking_for any conflict over this '' -- the president said_0 he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor_women in cases of rape and incest . but only four days after that , mr._bush resurrected the veto threat . ``_i do not support federal_funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened , '' he proclaimed , and finally vetoed the measure last weekend . so what does george_bush really believe ? the answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal , increasingly powerful sides of the abortion_issue . the result is mistrust and criticism from all around . anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally . `` in all honesty if_you ask me , ` is this man a true believer ? ' i_do n't_know , ''_says john fowler , head of the washington-based ad hoc committee in defense of life inc . yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical . douglas gould , vice_president of communications for the planned parenthood federation of america , calls mr._bush 's position on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` the guy has n't done one_thing about prevention . he 's totally geared to a punitive position . '' mr._bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question . for most of the past nine years , he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position . but ever_since the supreme_court 's webster vs. reproductive_health services decision this_year changed the political landscape of the abortion_issue , the president seemingly has tried just as hard to_avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall . many americans still agonize over their_own personal feelings about abortion . mr._bush 's problem is n't so_much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it . the political risk would_be far_less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it , experts insist 0 . `` if_you have a position , you_'re better_off to stick with it than to move around very_much , ''_says republican strategist john sears . the need for consistency is especially acute for mr._bush , who , mr. sears maintains 0 , lacks a strong ideological base . by his moderate republican heritage as_well as the warnings of political advisers who say_0 the issue is vital to younger voters , the president might seem to have at_least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments . yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises 0 he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white_house . on many issues -- flag-burning , for_instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts . but mr._bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion_issue , failing_to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would_be aroused following last_summer 's supreme_court decision to restrict those rights in the webster case . `` it was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes 0 i_'ve ever seen , ''_says former reagan pollster richard wirthlin . these_days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually loquacious president can_be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness . ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance . `` my position is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied . a close look_at his record over the last 15_years suggests_that mr._bush has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue . in 1974 , as the u.s. representative to the united_nations , he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor . running for president in early 1980 , he was also quoted as supporting federal_funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and to save the life of the mother . in his rolling stone interview in 1980 , mr._bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , ronald_reagan . in_addition to supporting the landmark roe_vs. wade supreme_court decision legalizing abortion , mr._bush said_0 he opposed the constitutional ban_on abortion that mr. reagan was promising to_promote . as mr. reagan 's running mate , though , mr._bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position , endorsing a constitutional_amendment outlawing abortion . he acknowledged only one difference with mr. reagan -- that the amendment ought_to have exceptions for rape and incest as_well as to save a woman 's life . throughout the early_1980s , mr._bush was_quoted sometimes supporting federal_funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it . in april_1986 , then-vice president_bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional_amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape , incest and life endangerment , but that he opposed federal_funding in all but the latter case . at the gop convention last_year , he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape , incest and life endangerment . his rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office , affirming his `` firm support of our cause '' during an anti-abortion rally three_days after his inauguration last january . he again urged passage of a constitutional_amendment outlawing abortion . but when the high_court ruled in the webster case in july , the president began to lower the volume . when the ruling was handed down , the vacationing president dispatched chief of staff john sununu to issue a statement and refused_to answer questions himself . he did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the district of columbia 's right to use its_own tax money to fund abortions for poor_women and over restoring funding to the united_nations population fund . but in the months since_then , while trying_to drum_up support for other issues -- such_as an anti-flag-burning constitutional_amendment -- he has shied away_from talking_about abortion . what few comments he has initiated have_been oblique , such_as urging `` greater efforts toward the protection of human life '' at a meeting of catholic lawyers in boston last_month . the white_house has likewise avoided any involvement in florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion , which anti-abortion forces had regarded_as a key test of their ability_to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions . the session failed to enact any new curbs . now , some see mr._bush trapped in a position 0 he is neither comfortable_with nor able_to escape . ken ruberg , head of the republican mainstream committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` the administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
