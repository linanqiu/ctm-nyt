it was supposed_to be a routine courtesy call . a half-dozen soviet space officials , in tokyo in july for an exhibit , stopped by to see their counterparts at the national space development agency of japan . but after a few pleasantries , the soviets unexpectedly got serious . the soviets have a world-leading space program , the guests noted 0 . would n't the japanese like a piece of it ? the visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware . ``_we were just surprised , ''_says tad inada , nasda 's director for international affairs . `` shocked . '' that moscow , with its dilapidated economic machine , would try_to sell high_technology to japan , one of the world 's high-tech leaders , sounds_like a coals-to-newcastle notion . but `` the soviet_union has areas where it is n't behind japan , ''_says mikhail shapovalov of the soviet ministry of foreign economic relations . ``_we have obtained through the development of cosmos -lcb- the soviet space program -rcb- technologies 0 you_do n't see anywhere else . '' the sales pitch might n't be as farfetched as it seems . japan-u.s. trade relations are bumpy these_days , and some japanese favor decreasing their reliance_on u.s. technology in light of the fsx fighter-plane flap , when u.s. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused_to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology . and , despite its image as a technology superpower , japan has a_lot of weaknesses . it 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the u.s. in making the computers that use those chips . it 's a world leader in auto manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is years behind the u.s. , the europeans and the soviets . one question being debated in the soviet_union is how to use the defense sector 's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy . many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food-processing machinery . the soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science , which has helped them win twice_as many nobel science prizes as the japanese . where they lag behind the japanese is in turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production . by_contrast , the japanese have proved adept at making use of soviet inventions . kobe_steel ltd. adopted soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its_own system . kawasaki steel corp. bought a soviet steel-casting patent two_years ago and has jointly developed the system with the soviets . in 1991 , the soviets will_take a japanese journalist into space , the first japanese to go_into orbit . soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do_n't appear to worry the u.s. , japan 's principal ally . ``_we have never opposed the development of economic relations_between our allies and the soviet_union , ''_says a state_department official . `` frankly , i would n't_expect the japanese to get hooked on anybody 's technology , least of all the soviets . '' under mikhail_gorbachev 's perestroika , the soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets . they believe_0 technology is one of their best bets , and some soviet officials_say 0 moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right . the soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in new_york and west_germany . last_week , a soviet delegation came to japan to push more space technologies . japan is a major target for the soviets . in_august , representatives of keidanren , japan 's_largest business organization , visited moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the soviet economy . out of the blue , the soviet chamber of commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the japanese might want to buy . these mainly involved such areas as materials -- advanced soldering machines , for_example -- and medical developments derived from experimentation in space , such_as artificial blood vessels . a main motive is hard cash . but , while the soviets ca_n't expect direct technology flow from japan , they also hope to benefit from japanese manufacturing expertise . `` the soviet_union has a_lot of know-how , but it has_been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , ''_says mr. shapovalov , the foreign_ministry official . the soviets are `` contemplating a flexible system under which it would_be possible to develop -lcb- technology -rcb- jointly and even to market it jointly , '' he_says 0 . even_if the japanese find soviet technology desirable , such discussions would_be fraught with political complications . still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two_years ago of sensitive military technology to the soviets by a subsidiary of japan 's toshiba_corp. , many japanese are eager to_avoid appearing to help the soviets in any way . another hurdle concerns japan 's attempts_to persuade the soviet_union to relinquish its post-world war_ii control of four islands north of japan . so_far , the soviets have provided only the sketchiest information_about their technology and business plans . and what they have_shown is n't impressive . `` my impression is that there_is n't anything which arouses our interest at first glance , ''_says an_official from japan 's ministry of international_trade and industry . peter gumbel in moscow contributed_to this_article .
