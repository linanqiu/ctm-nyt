bob stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination . mr. stone thought_0 the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get_rid of him for personal_reasons . unable_to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing . at the scheduled time , mr. stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked . after the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` go_ahead and tell_us what_happened . we may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait_until the end . '' no lawyers or tape recorders were present . the only extra people were a couple of personnel_specialists , one of whom knew mr. stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture . over a cup of coffee , mr. stone told his story . he talked about 20_minutes . when he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said_0 they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . the chairman promised mr. stone a decision within_two weeks . bob stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real . it happened at northrop corp. in los_angeles . the court is called the management appeals committee , or just `` mac , '' and it is_likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year . alter some details of this example and it could_be taking_place today at federal_express in memphis , the defense and underseas systems divisions of honeywell in minneapolis , a general_electric plant in columbia , md. , or a number_of other companies . these firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what i call corporate due_process . although corporate due_process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry . in the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are_likely to adopt it . corporate due_process appeals to management for a variety_of reasons . it reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all 0 that means for reduced legal costs and better public_relations . it helps to_keep out unions . it increases employee commitment to the company , with all 0 that means for efficiency and quality control . what must your management_team do to establish corporate due_process ? here are four key steps : 1 . make_sure 0 you have a strong personnel department . it must_be able_to handle most of the complaints that can_not be_solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will_be inundated with cases . at polaroid , the personnel policy planning committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds_of complaints are resolved at earlier stages . at twa , the system board of adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel_specialists . at citicorp , the problem review board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution . in a typical year , up to 20_% of the work_force goes to personnel_specialists with complaints of unfair treatment . in a large company that means many hundreds_of complaints for personnel 0 to handle . 2 . formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach . see that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . coach them in handling complaints so that they_can resolve problems immediately . in case managers and personnel_specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they_are bound to happen . in the 15 companies 0 i studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20_% to 40_% . 3 . decide_whether you_want a panel system or a single adjudicator . a panel system like that in the bob stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . an adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy . international_business machines and bank of america are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach . 4 . make your due-process system visible . it wo_n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it . most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . on the other_hand , they make_sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel_specialists . smith-kline beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit tv programs . naturally , one of the best ways_0 to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top_management to support it . at ibm , the company 's open door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief_executive . federal_express goes further in this respect than any company 0 i_know of with both frederick smith and james barksdale , chief_executive and chief_operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the appeals board almost every tuesday to decide cases . mr. ewing is a consultant based in winchester , mass. , and author of `` justice on the job : resolving grievances in the nonunion workplace '' -lrb- harvard business school press , 1989 -rrb- .
