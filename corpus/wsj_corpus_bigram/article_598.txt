when walter yetnikoff , the president of sony_corp. 's cbs_records , last_month told producer peter_guber that sony was about to make a $_3.4 billion bid for columbia_pictures and needed someone 0 to run the studio , mr._guber jumped at the chance . within_two days , he was on his way to new_york and tokyo to meet with top brass at sony . and before the week was out , sony had offered mr._guber and his partner , jon_peters , the most_lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business . not_only that , sony also agreed_to give_them a stake_in columbia 's future profits and buy their company , guber_peters entertainment_co. , for $_200 million , almost 40_% more_than the market_value of the company . there was just one sticking point : the two had a prior commitment . just seven_months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for warner bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit ``_batman . '' but mr._guber figured that warner_communications inc. chairman steven ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing 0 the sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . '' he figured wrong . last_week , following fruitless settlement_talks , warner , now merging with time inc. , filed a $_1 billion breach of contract suit in los_angeles superior court against both sony and guber_peters . sony promptly countersued , charging warner with trying_to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u.s. movie business . the accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both_sides : as one sony executive puts it , `` it 's world_war iii . '' that two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business . and they_are a very odd team in any_case . mr._guber was raised in boston and educated in new_york . he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees . mr._peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as barbra streisand 's hairdresser . yet , they_are far and away the most prolific producers in hollywood . and despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money . that is a skill 0 sony badly needs -- and warner is loath to lose . although columbia had a good summer with `` ghostbusters ii '' and `` when harry met sally , '' rivals such_as warner , paramount pictures , walt_disney co. and universal studios have_been thrashing columbia at the box_office . after five_years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team 0 to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits . mr._guber and mr._peters are n't universally loved in hollywood but they_are well connected . their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them . sometimes mr._guber and mr._peters do little more_than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such_as `` the color purple . '' it falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing . with mgm\/ua 's `` rainman , '' for_instance , messrs. guber and peters had virtually nothing 0 to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they_are inevitably associated_with its success . sometimes , as with ``_batman , '' the pair really do make the film . in that case , guber_peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in london for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production . `` they_'re the best production talent around , ''_says brian de palma , beholden to guber_peters for hiring him to direct the warner movie of tom wolfe 's novel `` bonfire of the vanities . '' on that film , which is to start shooting in a few_months , `` they_'ve been very_much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script . and when_you 're_making a movie this big , you_need all the help 0 you_can get , '' mr. de palma adds . ``_i wish 0 they_were around 24_hours a day . '' and some movies seem to have_been hurt_by their inattention . warner executives blame mr._guber 's and mr._peters 's lack_of involvement in `` caddyshack ii '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure . ``_we 've_had a few bombs , '' admits mr._peters . `` but by and large this company has only been profitable . '' he_says 0 his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we_'ll be good at columbia . we practically ran our_own studio . '' longtime hollywood associates describe mr._guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing . `` peter is a major piece of hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , ''_says robert bookman , an agent at creative artists agency . mark johnson , the producer of `` rainman , '' chimes in : `` he has a great ability_to hire terrific people and delegate authority ... . it 's no accident that they_'ve been_able to develop such successful material . '' mr._peters , on the other_hand , has fewer fans in hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully . he gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man . he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did . barbra streisand made him famous . he cut her hair . he lived with her . he came to produce her records and her movies -- `` a star is born '' and `` the main event . '' thrice married but now single , mr._peters got plenty_of ink last_summer for an on-set romance with actress kim basinger during the making of ``_batman . '' mr._guber , by_contrast , has_been married to one woman for more_than 20_years . but for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , hollywood associates say_0 . `` peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when_you 're_doing a deal , ''_says one agent . `` if there 's a problem , peter disappears , and all of a sudden jon shows up . '' mr._guber and mr._peters rub many_people in hollywood the wrong way . producers don simpson and jerry bruckheimer , who shepherded `` flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when messrs. guber and peters take credit for the film . says mr._simpson : `` the script was unreadable . we reinvented it . we are the producers of that movie . they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers . when roger birnbaum , an executive who_worked for guber_peters in the early_1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the united artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films 0 he had helped develop , including `` rainman '' and ``_batman . '' mr._peters acknowledges_that and says_0 it 's not unlike the situation 0 he and mr._guber are in with warner . ``_i was upset with roger , i fumpered and schmumpered , ''_says mr._peters . `` but he wanted to_pursue his_own dream , and he went . '' still , mr. birnbaum says_0 his relationship_with guber_peters was `` one of the most_successful 0 i_'ve had in hollywood . '' the two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- jon is very impulsive , and peter is very compulsive , '' adds 0 mr. birnbaum , who is now head of production at news corp. 's 20th_century fox film co . `` jon_peters will come barreling into a room , say_0 he 's got a great idea , and be gone . peter will_take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific ... . '' mr. birnbaum recalls that mr._guber and mr._peters shifted into high gear a few_years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist dian fossey , which became `` gorillas in the mist . '' he_says , `` within a few_weeks , we made deals with the government of rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to dian fossey . i_think 0 peter even made some deals with the gorillas . '' universal studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed_to co-produce the film with guber_peters and warner . more recently , guber_peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including robert redford and ted turner , for rights to the life story of chico mendes , the murdered brazilian union leader who fought developers in the amazon rain forest . messrs. guber and peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` gorillas in the mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work . money helped , too . ultimately , they paid more_than $_1 million for the rights . -lrb- the sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her_husband 's followers . some of the money will_go to the chico mendes foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying_to save the rain forest . -rrb- it 's hardly astonishing -lrb- given the men 's track_record -rrb- that sony wants mr._guber and mr._peters . but it is puzzling to some hollywood executives that sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the warner situation first . some note that sony might_have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr._guber and letting mr._peters stay on to fulfill the warner contract . but though `` people in town may ask why guber needs peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , ''_says 0 steven tisch , a producer who once worked for mr._guber . `` this business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- it s about whether the ink is red or black . in the case of peter and jon , the ink has_been very , very black . '' mr._guber got his start in the movie business at columbia two_decades ago . recruited from new_york university 's mba program , he rose within_two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` the way_0 we were , '' `` taxi driver , '' `` tommy '' and `` shampoo . '' in 1976 , he teamed up with record producer neil bogart in casablanca records and filmworks -- later called polygram pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` the deep , '' and `` midnight express . '' in 1980 , mr._guber got together with mr._peters , by then a successful producer in his_own right , after the death of mr. bogart . while guber_peters produced a number_of hits for warner and others , their record was n't_always so impressive . among their clinkers were `` the legend of billie jean , '' `` visionquest , '' `` clue '' and `` clan of the cave bear . '' and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates . the studio says_0 it stuck_with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner . '' mr._guber replies that `` this is a goliath , this time_warner , trying_to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time . '' mr._guber and mr._peters maintain that executives at warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that warner never felt threatened until they linked up with sony . `` from the beginning , -lcb- they -rcb- knew 0 we had a goal and a dream , ''_says mr._guber . on a number_of occasions , he_adds 0 , he tried_to get warner to buy guber_peters outright . `` they always listened , but they never acted , '' mr._guber says . in 1987 , mr._guber and mr._peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28_% stake_in barris entertainment , a small-fry tv production company controlled_by giant industries_inc. chairman burt_sugarman . in july a year later , warner agreed_to release the producers from their old contract when messrs. guber , peters and sugarman made a $_100 million offer to buy 25_% of mgm\/ua . mr._guber and mr._peters planned to run the nearly dormant mgm studio , and the two even tried_to interest warner bros . ' president terry semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal . but the mgm plan collapsed just two_weeks later . mr._guber and mr._peters say_0 they got a look_at the books and balked_at the price . their relationship_with mr. sugarman soured shortly thereafter . last may , he sold his 24_% stake_in barris to a passive australian investor and barris was renamed guber_peters entertainment co . meanwhile , mr._guber and mr._peters had agreed_to extend their warner agreement_with the new five-year exclusive contract . the new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom . but it paled by_comparison to what sony was to offer last_month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50_million in deferred compensation , up to 10_% of columbia 's future cash_flow , 8_% of the future appreciation of columbia 's market_value , and annual salaries of $_2.7 million for each . the producers ' 28_% share of publicly held guber_peters would net them an_additional $ 50_million . sony also agreed_to indemnify the producers against any liability to warner . sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last_year . and earnings have_been erratic . in the the latest_quarter , thanks in part to ``_batman , '' guber_peters earned_$ 5.8_million , or 50_cents a_share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8_million , or 62_cents a_share , in last_year 's quarter . guber_peters stock , which traded as low as $_6 a_share last_year , closed_yesterday at $ 16.625 . the two_sides now are accusing each_other of lying . mr._guber and mr._peters claim 0 they have an oral_agreement with warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise . but in affidavits filed yesterday in the los_angeles court , mr._ross , warner bros. chairman robert daly and president semel deny that such an oral_agreement was ever made . warner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . '' mr._daly in his_affidavit acknowledges_that warner agreed_to release the producers last_year to take_over mgm but says_0 that situation was altogether different . for one_thing , according_to mr._daly , the producers requested a release in advance . moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of guber_peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it is now . warner itself was in negotiations_with mgm over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in warner 's interest to accommodate mgm\/ua , guber and peters by permitting them to become mgm executives , '' mr._daly said in his_affidavit . warner obviously does_n't think that it is in its_own interests to let mr._guber and mr._peters go off to columbia . at the very least , mr._ross clearly sees an_opportunity to use the two_men to get a pound of flesh from sony . during settlement_talks , for_example , warner demanded such things as cable tv rights to columbia movies and columbia 's interest in the studio 0 it jointly owns with warner , according_to executives involved in the talks . in any settlement , warner is almost_certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects 0 mr._guber and mr._peters have locked up for the next_few years , notably sequels to ``_batman . '' mr._guber and mr._peters refuse to concede_that they may_have made a tactical error in accepting the sony offer before taking it up with warner . and they say_0 there_are plenty_of precedents in hollywood for letting people out of contracts . the last time 0 columbia_pictures was looking_for a studio chief , they note 0 , warner released producer david puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at columbia . in his_affidavit filed yesterday , warner 's mr._ross indicated 0 he is n't buying any such argument : `` if sony succeeds here , no written contract in hollywood will_be worth the paper 0 it 's written on .
