nothing stirred the soul of ronald_reagan and his disciples as_much as the crusade to aid nicaragua 's contra_rebels , or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out soviet nuclear missiles . yet under mr. reagan 's preferred successor , president_bush , those two cherished national-security causes are withering on the vine . and , surprisingly , little more_than a whimper of protest is being heard , even_though reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the contras and the strategic_defense initiative . `` the programs have arthritis , ''_says rep. henry hyde , a conservative republican from illinois . yet , he asserts , `` you_look around ... and you say , ` who are the leaders ? who is going_to carry the water ? ' '' it is n't surprising that president_bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the contras or sdi . though he nominally supports both programs , mr._bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause , as mr. reagan was . what 's surprising is that there_is n't more of a conservative outcry as the bush_administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list . a combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility . above all , though , conservative republicans who have championed both the contras and sdi are_reluctant to attack a republican president for failing_to do more -- though that reluctance may_be receding . ``_we want to complain , we_want to say something about it , and we_'re going_to as it gets worse , ''_says rep. dan burton , an indiana republican who has_been a staunch contra backer . `` but it 's like kicking your father in the pants . you hate to do it because he 's your father . '' mr. burton says_0 conservatives ' unhappiness with mr._bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make_them more willing_to speak out . of course , neither president_bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contras or sdi . mr._bush has struck a deal_with congressional_leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february . but the administration has dropped any effort to win military_aid for the rebels . and the administration 's deal_with congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut_off even humanitarian_aid next_month , though the committees are_likely to let aid continue until february . most analysts think_0 there 's little prospect 0 the contras can_be a significant fighting force without u.s. arms , and after the february election their future in any form will_be murky at best . instead of focusing_on the contras , mr._bush has switched to urging members of congress -- most recently in a white_house meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's sandinista government . the administration continues to support sdi , or star wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds 0 it planned to cut from the program . and just last_week , defense_secretary dick cheney gave a strong speech listing `` compelling reasons '' 0 to push ahead with sdi and saying_0 he 'd urge president_bush to veto a defense bill with `` inadequate '' funding for the program . but the strong pitch by mr._cheney may_be too little too_late 0 to prevent damage to sdi . the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's backers will_be hard pressed to head_off some reduction in spending next_year . and while the defense_secretary is speaking out , president_bush himself has n't launched any high-visibility campaign to drum_up support , as president_reagan did . the administration also acknowledges_that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original vision of an `` impenetrable shield '' protecting the whole u.s. , but rather a more modest version . more ominous to sdi supporters , the bush_administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the soviet_union that spells long-term trouble for star wars . the soviets have agreed_to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions_on space-based defenses . but the soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw_from the completed strategic-arms treaty later on if the u.s. does sdi testing or deployment that the soviets think_0 violates the existing anti-ballistic-missile treaty . it will_be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers fear 0 those plans could scuttle a completed treaty . as a result , frank gaffney , a former reagan pentagon aide who now heads the center for security policy , charges that the administration 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the sdi program strain credulity . '' still , proponents may_be shying away_from more drumbeating because_they sense 0 political tides have turned against arming the nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on sdi -- particularly when the public perceives 0 the soviet threat is declining under mikhail_gorbachev . in fact , because communism seems to be beating a global retreat , some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they do_n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs . `` the short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us can_not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , ''_says mitchell daniels , a former reagan white_house aide who now is president of the hudson institute . some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes . but they say_0 they ca_n't make much headway because of a lack_of willing leaders in a position 0 to turn the tide . one longtime champion of these programs in congress , republican whip newt gingrich of georgia , is distracted by questions_about his ethics , conservatives note 0 . other conservative champions , like wyoming republican sen. malcolm wallop , a longtime sdi advocate , do_n't have the clout with the bush white_house that they enjoyed with president_reagan . above all , though , proponents say_0 neither the contra nor the sdi cause can_be pushed much further without more presidential support . `` for there to be wind in the sails of any program , the chief_executive has to be blowing in the sails , ''_says rep. burton . all this causes rep. hyde to muse about an alternate way_0 to drum_up more enthusiasm . `` what i_'d like to see , if he is up to it , is for reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for sdi , '' the congressman says .
