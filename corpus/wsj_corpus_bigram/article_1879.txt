october employment data -- also could turn_out to be the most confusing . on the surface , the overall unemployment_rate is_expected to be little_changed from september 's 5.3_% . but the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is_likely to be muddied by the impact of hurricane_hugo , strikes , and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments , economists said_0 . the consensus view calls_for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared_with september 's 209,000 increase . but the important factory-jobs segment , which last_month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears , is most_likely to be skewed by the month 's unusual events . several other reports come before friday_'s jobs data , including : the september leading_indicators index , new-home sales and october agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow ; the october purchasing_managers ' index and september construction_spending and manufacturers_' orders on wednesday ; and october chain-store sales on thursday . friday brings the final count on october auto sales . `` the employment_report is going_to be difficult 0 to interpret , '' said michael englund , economist with mms international , a unit of mcgraw-hill_inc. , new_york . mr. englund added that next_month 's data is n't likely_to be much better , because it will_be distorted by san_francisco 's earthquake . what 's more , he_believes 0 seasonal swings in the auto_industry this_year are n't occurring at the same_time as in the past , because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built_into the employment data . wednesday 's report from the purchasing agents will_be watched to see if the index maintains a level below_50 % , as it has for the past_couple of months . a reading of less_than 50_% indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading_above 50_% indicates an economy that 's expanding . samuel d. kahan , chief_financial economist_at kleinwort_benson government securities inc. , chicago , said that the purchasers ' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic_data for the month . but he_added : `` some people use the purchasers ' index as a leading indicator , some use it as a coincident indicator . but the thing 0 it 's supposed_to measure -- manufacturing strength -- it missed altogether last_month . '' david wyss , chief_financial economist_at data resources_inc. , boston , said that the purchasers ' index `` does miss occasionally , '' adding : `` when it misses one_month it tends_to miss the next_month , too . '' the consensus view on september leading_indicators calls_for a gain of 0.3_% , the same as in_august . economists said_0 greatly increased consumer optimism , a larger money_supply and higher stock_prices helped lift the index . all orders-related components , such_as consumer-goods orders and building_permits , are thought to have_been weaker . data resources ' mr. wyss added that he will_be keeping a closer eye than ususal on october chain-store sales . usually , october `` is n't a very interesting month -lcb- for retail figures -rcb- because school clothes have_been bought and people are waiting_for december to buy christmas presents , '' he said_0 . but mr. wyss said_0 he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers ' general buying habits may slack off as_much as their auto-buying apparently has . he_noted that higher gasoline prices will_help buoy the october totals . seasonal factors are also expected to have_taken their toll on september new-home sales , which are believed to have_fallen sharply from august 's 755,000 units . construction_spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5_% from august levels , although economists noted 0 the rate probably will pick_up in the months_ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake_damage .
