once you make up your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ? you just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . '' dream on . there_are all_sorts of ways_0 to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many_ways 0 to get burned if_you do_n't know_what you_'re doing . so here 's a rundown of the most common types_of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity_exchanges . two things 0 to_keep in mind : not all exchanges accept every type of order . and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage_firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . market order : this is probably the most widely_used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor_brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions . with a market order , an_investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' it 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' for_example , if wheat is being_offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would_be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . a recent indictment alleges_that some floor_brokers at the two largest chicago commodity_exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . limit order : limit_orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount 0 they will_receive or pay for an investment . investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may_be sold or the maximum price that may_be paid for it . suppose 0 an_investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less_than $_55 . a limit order to sell could_be entered at that price . one risk : investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls . unless the market goes at_least one tick -lrb- the smallest price increment permitted -rrb- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may_not be sufficient trading_volume 0 to permit filling it at the specified_price . stop order : stop_orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can_get . stop_orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because_they are frequently used to_protect profits or limit losses . while stop_orders sound similar to limit_orders , there_is a difference : sell stops must_be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . in contrast , sell limit_orders must_be placed above the market price and buy limit_orders are placed below . the crash in october_1987 and last_friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly_what stop_orders will and wo_n't do . an_investor who may_have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $_100 a_share on the friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $_75 when the stock opened at that price on monday . stop-limit order : stop-limit orders turn_into limit_orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . unlike stop_orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified_price . if it ca_n't be made at that price , it_does n't get filled . investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must_be filled . but if the market moves quickly enough , it may_be impossible for the broker to carry_out the order because the investment has passed the specified_price . market-if-touched order : market-if-touched orders are like stop_orders in that they become market orders if a specified_price is reached . however , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . as_soon as the market trades at the specified_price the floor broker will fill it at the best_possible price . fill-or-kill order : the fill-or-kill order is one of several associated_with the timing of trades . it instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified_price or better . but if the investment ca_n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled . gregory bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed u.s. trading championship , says_0 he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . ``_i like to use them to feel out the market , '' he_says . `` if_they do_n't fill it immediately , then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . '' not-held order : this is another timing order . it is a market order that allows floor_brokers to take more time 0 to buy or sell an investment , if_they think_0 they_can get a better price by waiting . not-held orders , which are also known_as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . one-cancels-the-other order : this is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor_brokers to fill whichever order they_can first and then cancel the other order . in a fast-moving market , it prevents an_investor from getting stuck_with having made two trades on the same security . specific-time order : this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must_be carried_out at or by a certain time . `` on the close '' can_be added to many types_of orders . for_example , `` market-on-close orders '' must_be filled during the last few_minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined_by the exchange . `` stop-close-only orders '' are stop_orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . `` day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they_are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration_date . most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . on_oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit_orders '' and then forgetting about them . they found 0 they had bought stock from limit_orders that they might_have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel . it is always the responsibility of investors to_keep track of the orders 0 they have placed . investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has_been filled are , usually , stuck_with the consequences . mr. angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for the wall_street journal .
