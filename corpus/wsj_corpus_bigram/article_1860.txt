this has n't been kellogg co. 's year . the oat-bran craze has cost the world 's_largest cereal maker market share . the company 's president quit suddenly . and now kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $_1 billion cereal plant . the company said_0 it was delaying construction because of current market_conditions . but the memphis , tenn. , facility was n't to begin turning out product until 1993 , so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as_well . kellogg , which has n't been as successful in capitalizing on the public 's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival general_mills inc. , has_been losing share in the $_6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market . kellogg 's current share is believed to be slightly under 40_% while general_mills ' share is about 27_% . led_by its oat-based cheerios line , general_mills has gained an_estimated 2_% share so_far this_year , mostly at the expense of kellogg . each share point is worth about $ 60 million in sales . analysts_say 0 much of kellogg 's erosion has_been in such core brands as corn flakes , rice krispies and frosted flakes , which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume . kellogg is so anxious to turn around corn flakes sales that it soon will_begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents , trade sources say_0 . `` cheerios and honey nut cheerios have eaten away sales normally going_to kellogg 's corn-based lines simply because_they are made of oats , ''_says merrill_lynch food analyst william maguire . `` they_are not a happy group of people at battle creek right_now . '' kellogg is based in battle creek , mich. , a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world . another analyst , john_c. maxwell jr. of wheat , first securities in richmond , va. , recently went to a `` sell '' recommendation on kellogg stock , which closed friday at $ 71.75 , down 75_cents , in new_york stock_exchange composite_trading . ``_i do_n't think_0 kellogg can_get back to 40_% this_year , '' he said . `` kellogg 's main problem is life_style . people are reading the boxes and deciding 0 they_want something that 's ` healthy ' for you -- oats , bran . '' mr. maxwell said_0 he would n't be surprised if , over the next two_years or so , general_mills ' share increased to 30_% or more . in announcing the plant delay , kellogg chairman william_e. lamothe said , `` cereal volume growth in the u.s. has not met our expectations for 1989 . '' he said_0 construction would n't resume until market_conditions warrant it . kellogg indicated_that it has room 0 to grow without adding facilities . the company has five other u.s. plants , including a modern facility at its battle creek headquarters known_as building 100 , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next_year . general_mills , meanwhile , finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity . a large plant in covington , ga. , is to come on line next_year . a kellogg officer , who asked_not to be named , said_0 the memphis project was `` pulled in for a reconsideration of costs , '' an_indication that the ambitious plans might_be scaled_back in any future construction . initial cost estimates for the plant , which was to have_been built in phases , ranged_from $_1 billion to $_1.2 billion . a company spokesman_said 0 it was `` possible , but highly unlikely , '' that the plant might never be_built . `` as we regain our leadership level where we have_been , and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity , we will look_at resuming our involvement with our plan , '' he said . the new facility was to have_been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing_plant , and kellogg 's_largest construction project . the company had retained the fluor daniel unit of fluor corp. as general contractor . but in recent_weeks , construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site . subcontractors said_0 they_were told that equipment orders would_be delayed . fluor daniel already_has reassigned most of its work crew , the sources_said 0 . last_friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may_have been overly optimistic . until_recently , kellogg had_been telling its sales_force and wall_street that by 1992 it intended_to achieve a 50_% share of market , measured in dollar volume . although he called current market_conditions `` highly competitive , '' mr. lamothe , kellogg 's chairman and chief_executive officer , forecast an earnings increase for the full year . last_year , the company_earned $ 480.4 million , or $ 3.90 a_share , on sales of $ 4.3 billion . as expected , kellogg reported lower third-quarter_earnings . net_fell 16_% to $ 123.1 million , or $_1.02 a_share , from $ 145.7 million , or $_1.18 a_share . sales_rose 4.8_% to $_1.20 billion from $ 1.14 billion . the company had a one-time charge of $ 14.8 million in the latest_quarter covering the disposition of certain assets . the company would n't_elaborate , citing competitive reasons .
