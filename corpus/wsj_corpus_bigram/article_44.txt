the bush_administration said_0 it is submitting a `` comprehensive '' proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations . the proposal reiterates the u.s. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products . but it would_allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would_be achieved . the u.s. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , together with existing tariffs , then would_be phased_out over 10_years . trade_representative carla_hills , who along_with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter unveiled the proposal , said_0 she is confident 0 it will gain considerable support from the u.s. 's trading partners . mr. yeutter , seeking to allay european objections to an earlier u.s. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year_2000 , said_0 the new u.s. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants . '' the u.s. is submitting the proposal today in geneva , hoping that the initiative will spur members of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in december 1990 . another u.s. proposal filed monday urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies . unlike the earlier u.s. farm-trade proposal which struck european_countries as too extreme , the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver . for_instance , the new u.s. package makes clear 0 there would_be a transition period during which gatt members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition . it also says_0 countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if_they experience an_unusually heavy_volume of imports . instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies , as the earlier u.s. proposal did , the new package calls_for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones . less objectionable ones would_be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would_be allowed to continue under certain_conditions . the new u.s. plan also would establish procedures 0 to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily . the goal would_be to resolve disputes such_as one prompted by the european_community 's current attempt_to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated u.s. cattle . the u.s. contends_that the rules are n't justified on health grounds . to encourage more competition among exporting_countries , the u.s. is proposing that export subsidies , including tax incentives for exporters , be_phased out in five_years .
