china_'s slide toward recession is beginning to look_like a free_fall . in a report on china_'s foundering economy , the official state_statistical bureau disclosed that industrial output last_month rose 0.9_% from a year_earlier - the lowest growth_rate in a decade for september . retail_sales are plummeting , while consumer_prices still are rising . chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation . `` the economy is crashing hard , ''_says an asian economist in beijing . `` the slowdown is taking hold a_lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . '' a lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers . experts predict 0 the coming year will_be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget_deficit . unless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo_n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest . the economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in_september 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation . -lrb- industrial output surged 21_% in 1988 , while inflation peaked last february at nearly 30_% . -rrb- the slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three_days a week . in western , market-driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency . in china , however , there_is n't likely_to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state . instead , china is_likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last_year . nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely_to be_allowed to go bankrupt . rather , the brunt of the slowdown will_be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have_fallen into disfavor as china_'s leaders re-emphasize an orthodox marxist preference for public ownership . `` when the going gets rough , china penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , ''_says a western economist . reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major communist_party plenum for sometime in the next_few weeks . the meeting is_expected to call for heightened austerity for two_years . but with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing_signs of easing , some voices may call for measures 0 to pump new life into the economy . some_analysts believe_0 china soon will_begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit . that would benefit chinese enterprises as_well as sino-foreign joint_ventures , both of which have_been plagued by shortages of working_capital . a dangerous buildup this_year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse . one sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this_week of people 's bank of china , the central_bank , to allocate $ 5.4_billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official china daily reported 0 . but while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation . the cycle has_been repeated several_times since china began reforming its planned economy in 1979 . and , because china_'s leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is_likely to continue , analysts_say 0 . the statistical bureau 's report , cited in china daily , notes that industrial output in_september totaled_$ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9_% from a year_earlier . output declined in several provinces , including jiangsu and zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and sichuan , the nation_'s agricultural breadbasket . production in shanghai , china_'s industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8_% for the month . nationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8_% -- `` the first decline in 10_years , '' a bureau spokesman told china daily 0 . in an_unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they_can purchase manufacturers_' goods . `` this will prevent a slide in industrial_production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman_said .
