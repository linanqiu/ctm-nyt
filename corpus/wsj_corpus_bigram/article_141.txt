residents of this city soon will_be seeing ads urging them to visit `` cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- lake_view cemetery . despite such famous tenants as oil magnate john d. rockefeller , lake_view cemetery has_fallen on hard times . so the inner-city burial ground is trying_to resurrect itself with a television advertising_campaign . the ads celebrate the achievements of some of lake_view 's residents . a spot honoring bill white , the inventor of chewing gum , shows a woman trying_to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of gum . another focuses on charles brush , the first person 0 to light a city electrically . it shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp . street lights , the ad points out 0 , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . '' cemetery officials hope 0 the ads , which will_begin airing next_month , will not_only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions . lake_view had an operating deficit last_year and has a poor reputation_as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery . the private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct_mail and other advertising to sell lots . ``_we do_n't want to be known_as ambulance chasers , ''_says william garrison , lake_view 's president . ``_we want people to think of lake_view as an historical park and educational experience ... . a pleasant place 0 to come and spend a few_hours . '' not all of the cemetery 's better-known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however . for_example , president james_a. garfield is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 . -lrb- mr. garrison notes , however , that the garfield tomb is one of the nation_'s premier examples of romanesque architecture . -rrb- mr. rockefeller , buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk , did_n't seem right for an ad either . the oil magnate , who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image , `` is n't terribly amusing , ''_says 0 barry olson , creative director at innis-maggiore-olson , canton , ohio , which is producing the ads . but there_are plenty_of other promising prospects at lake_view , promoters believe_0 : ernest ball , for_instance , who wrote `` when irish eyes are smiling , '' and garrett morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .
