the government 's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2_% in_september , but economists said_0 the report offered little new information on the degree to which the u.s._economy is slowing . the small increase in the index of leading_indicators , which had climbed 0.5_% in_august but was_unchanged in july , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably . however , it_does n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon . ``_i do_n't think_0 it provides much new information on the economy , '' said richard rippe , economist_at dean_witter reynolds_inc . so_far this_year , the index of leading_indicators has_risen in four_months , fallen in four_months and remained unchanged in the other month . in another report yesterday , the commerce_department said_0 sales of new single-family houses plunged 14_% in_september to an annual_rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in_august . the declines were particularly pronounced in the northeast and in the south , where hurricane_hugo was a factor . although september 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier_this year has had only a limited beneficial effect_on the housing market . the september drop was the largest since a 19_% drop in january 1982 , but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic_indicators . because the figures_are based_on a small sample , the department said_0 it is 90_% confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere_between 5_% and 23_% during the month . the department also said_0 it takes four_months to establish a trend . so_far this_year , 534,000 newly built homes have_been sold , down 4.5_% from the like months of 1988 . the index of leading_indicators got a major boost in_september from a surge in consumer expectations as measured_by the university of michigan . this measure had dropped_sharply in_august . the commerce_department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has_been reduced . of the 11 components to the index , only three others rose in_september : the money_supply , the length of the average work week and stock_prices . several components that track the health of the manufacturing_sector of the economy turned_down in_september . these_include new orders for manufactured consumer_goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and backlogs of orders for durable_goods . meanwhile , the national_association of manufacturers said yesterday 0 a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do_n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later . the remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower_interest rates , 60_% of the executives said_0 they would_prefer that the fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even_if that means higher rates . the other 40_% said_0 the fed ought_to worry less about inflation and bring interest_rates down . all the figures_are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns . here are the net contributions of the components of the commerce_department 's index of leading_indicators . after various adjustments , they produced a 0.5_% rise in the index for august and a 0.2_% rise for september . september , and the change from august , are : from 1.11 in the previous_month .
