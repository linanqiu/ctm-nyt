it has more drug users than boston has people . thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes , while 50,000 residents have no homes at all . its tax base is shrinking , a $_1 billion budget_deficit looms , and the city faces contract_negotiations with all major municipal unions next_year . this is new_york city . when the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race , the man most_likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david_dinkins . running the nation_'s largest and most ornery city may_be no treat , but at_least mr._dinkins knows what to expect from it . as the campaign hits the home stretch , however , voters still have very little idea what they_can expect from him . after 25 years in city politics , david_dinkins remains an enigma . the soft-spoken , silver-haired manhattan_borough president -- the first black man 0 to win the democratic nomination for mayor here -- does_n't have a single prominent political enemy . while he is widely described_as a man with deep convictions , he has few major political programs that he can call his_own . asked about his greatest achievement in public life , he first speaks about the quality of his staff . now , as election day nears , even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on nov. 7 . they wonder_whether he can_be firm with his longtime allies , including union_leaders and political cronies who may_seek a place at the trough . they wonder_whether he has the economic know-how 0 to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis , and they wonder who will_be advising him . will he , if he wins , be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies , who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings , or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign ? after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in_september , mr._dinkins coasted , until_recently , on a quite-comfortable lead over his republican opponent , rudolph_giuliani , the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate . but mr._dinkins has stumbled in the past_two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper , and over his handling of a stock sale to his son . polls also have recorded some slippage in mr._dinkins 's support among jewish voters , and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage_points . in an_interview with reporters and editors of the wall_street journal , mr._dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability_to handle the mayoralty . `` a_lot of people think_0 i will give away the store , but i can assure you 0 i will not , '' he_says . ``_i am aware 0 we have real budgetary problems . '' the city is full of aging bridges , water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair . renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will_be costly . but city_officials say_0 tax revenues are lagging . and after a decade of explosive job growth on_wall street , a period of contraction is under_way . mr. koch already_has announced 0 he will drop 3,200 jobs from the city payroll , but that wo_n't be enough . new_york state comptroller edward regan predicts a $_1.3 billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal_year , a gap that could grow if there_is a recession . if elected , mr._dinkins will_probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods . `` he is going_to face a mess , ''_says city_council president andrew stein . `` his supporters are not venal , but their solution to everything will_be to spend_more money , and he wo_n't have any money . '' by and large , mr._dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore . instead of focusing_on the financial future , mr._dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by mayor koch . `` the thing about the dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people , ''_says meyer frucher , a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario cuomo . `` it is a feel-good candidacy . '' no_doubt , mr._dinkins has_been a calming influence . he is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues ' children , opens doors for women , and almost never has a bad word 0 to say about anybody . more_important , he emerged as a peacemaker last_summer after the central park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white brooklyn neighborhood of bensonhurst . rather_than scaring off white voters , as many predicted 0 he would , mr._dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his_reputation for having a cool head . -lrb- keeping cool is a dinkins priority : on humid days this_summer , he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four_times a day . -rrb- but even in his front-runner campaign , he has_shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say_0 has plagued his tenure as manhattan_borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor . over the last few_weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over mr._giuliani . a story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled_by his political patron percy sutton was allowed to fester a full week before mr._dinkins faced the media . he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke . his campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations 0 it paid almost $_10,000 for what it said_0 was a `` get-out-the-vote '' effort by black activist sonny carson , a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is `` anti-white . '' critics have said_0 the payment looked_like an_attempt by the dinkins camp to get mr. carson to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the bensonhurst murder -- protests 0 the campaign may_have feared 0 could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate . mr._dinkins also has failed to allay jewish voters ' fears_about his association with the rev. jesse jackson , despite the fact_that few local non-jewish politicians have_been as vocal for jewish causes in the past 20_years as mr._dinkins has . these campaign problems have echoed difficulties 0 mr._dinkins has run_into before . a former u.s. marine , mr._dinkins got off to a quick start in politics , joining a local democratic political club in the 1950s , linking up with black urban leaders such_as charles rangel , basil paterson and mr._sutton , and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965 . but his chance to become deputy_mayor under mayor abraham beame , a plan boosted_by mr._sutton , was squandered because of mr._dinkins 's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income_tax returns for four_years running . ``_i always thought of this as a thing that could always be_done tomorrow , '' he said at the time . later , mr._dinkins became more deeply indebted to mr._sutton and other city pols , including then-city council president paul o'dwyer , when they helped him get appointed city clerk , a largely ceremonial post responsible_for the city 's marriage bureau , among_other things . -lrb- mr. o'dwyer is now one of the lawyers for mr._sutton 's media company . -rrb- the debt rose further in 1977 when mr._sutton resigned his_position as manhattan_borough president to run for mayor . mr._sutton recalls : `` when i left , i sat down with charlie -lcb- rangel -rcb- , basil -lcb- paterson -rcb- and david , and david said , ` who will run for borough_president ? ' and i said , ` you will . ' '' david garth , mayor koch 's longtime media adviser , says of mr._dinkins , `` he really is the personification of the patronage system . but the guy is so personally decent , 0 people tend_to forget that . '' mr._dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough_president in 1985 . but by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best_known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate , the body that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters . colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as mr._dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to_discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals . `` he taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m. , i_'ll give him that , ''_says deputy_mayor robert esnard . often , mr._dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way_0 things turned_out , critics claim 0 . on the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member 0 to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle . but board members say_0 he took so_long to decide how to vote that by the time 0 he decided , it was too_late to try_to draw other members to his_position . says one city official : `` everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal . he would_have got a_lot more done if he made up his mind faster . '' one board member , bronx borough_president ferdinand ferrer , was said to be so impatient with mr._dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr._dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign . ``_i had some problem from time to time on the length of time 0 he would take to make up his mind , '' mr. ferrer admits , but he maintains that he did_n't delay his support of mr._dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate enthusiastically . mr._dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff , bill lynch , denies that the manhattan_borough president has_taken too_long to decide important issues . ``_we did_n't rubber-stamp everything that came to us , '' mr. lynch says . on some occasions when mr._dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign , he has run_into a familiar kind_of trouble . some supporters were stunned this_summer when mr._dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike . he withdrew the remark . when he later sided with striking hospital workers , some allies cringed a little more , concerned that mr._dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract_negotiations with city employees . then , two_days before receiving an endorsement from environmental_groups , mr._dinkins promised 0 he would issue a three-year moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator plants . that announcement was roundly criticized by mayor koch -- who has endorsed mr._dinkins -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $_5 million planning for an incinerator that would_be scrapped under mr._dinkins 's proposal . while his public statements have at times been confusing , mr._dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment . he favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial_community believes_0 would make it more_difficult to attract investment in the city . in the midst_of a labor shortage , he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new_york city residents . with an untrained local labor pool , many experts believe_0 , that policy could drive businesses from the city . and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new_jersey and connecticut in the battle_over companies thinking of moving employees out of new_york city . many economic-development officials_say 0 the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 chase_manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson . but mr._dinkins 's economic planks do_n't seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support . steven spinola , president of the real_estate board of new_york , an industry organization , says_0 mr._dinkins 's `` economic_development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can_be reasonable . '' mr._dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists , leaving voters with little clue as to who will_be more influential . the key man seems to be the campaign manager , mr. lynch . a disheveled , roly-poly son of a long island potato farmer , mr. lynch is a veteran union organizer who_worked on the presidential campaigns of sen._edward kennedy and mr._jackson . but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this_month , andrew cuomo , the politically seasoned son of the new_york governor , is also said to have_taken a more active role on strategy . another close ally is ruth messinger , a manhattan city councilwoman , some of whose programs , such_as commercial rent control , have made their way into mr._dinkins 's position papers . if she remains influential with mr._dinkins , as some suggest 0 she will , his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor . but lincoln center president nathan leventhal , who would head a dinkins transition team , is more mainstream , as is real-estate executive anthony gliedman , another insider . mr._dinkins also has said_0 he would_receive economic advice from a board that would include american_express co. chairman james d. robinson iii , investment_banker felix rohatyn , leveraged-buy-out specialist reginald lewis and attorney joseph flom . some business_leaders and others also believe_that mr._dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy_mayor with a strong administrative background . names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard ravitch , former schools chancellor frank macchiarola and messrs. leventhal and gliedman . then there_are mr._dinkins 's old-time harlem colleagues , such_as u.s. rep. rangel , former deputy_mayor paterson and mr._sutton . having attained positions of real influence or wealth , these men constitute the old_guard of new_york city black politics ; they_are less confrontational than the younger , more activist black political community that has_been based largely in brooklyn . -lrb- part_of mr._dinkins 's strength is his ability_to win the support of both the brooklyn and harlem factions . -rrb- ``_we know 0 there_are potholes for the city out there , ''_says mr. paterson , mr._dinkins 's former law partner . `` if any of us think_0 we_'re going_to sidetrack david 's determination 0 to be the best_possible mayor because of his obligations to us , we are making a sad mistake . '' adds ms. messinger , who is_expected to win the borough_president 's job 0 mr._dinkins is vacating , `` you have to remember 0 david is a pragmatist . '' but mr._dinkins 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart . he is taken aback in an_interview when asked_whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of new_york 's school system . ``_i will sit_down and talk some of the problems out , but take on the political system ? uh-uh , '' he_says with a shake of the head . despite many doubts about his candidacy , white new yorkers -- who gave mr._dinkins 30_% of their votes in the primary -- are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr._giuliani . the former u.s._attorney , who prosecuted targets ranging_from mafia dons to wall_street executives , has succeeded in raising questions_about mr._dinkins 's ethical standards , but so_far has failed to generate excitement about his_own candidacy . as a republican in an overwhelmingly democratic city , mr._giuliani has an inherent handicap . as a first-time candidate , he has_been slow to learn the nuances of new_york city politicking . mr._giuliani is finding that mr._dinkins , in his many years in public life , has built up considerable good will that so_far has led many voters to overlook certain failings . `` the bottom_line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy , ''_says malcolm hoenlein , a jewish community leader . `` in the end , i_think 0 david will_be judged for being david .
