international_business machines_corp. said_0 earnings tumbled 30_% in the third_quarter , even a_bit further than expected , rendering the outlook doubtful for the next_few quarters . the main_reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk_drives , a business that accounts for some 10_% of ibm 's $ 60 billion of annual_revenue . ibm , which telegraphed the poor results three_weeks ago , also cited an_increase in its leasing business , which tends_to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near_term . in_addition , ibm noted_that the stronger_dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they_are translated_into dollars . earnings_fell to $ 877 million , or $ 1.51 a_share , somewhat below securities analysts_' revised expectations of around $ 1.60 a_share . that compared_with the year-earlier $_1.25 billion , or $ 2.10 a_share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some mci_communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu_ltd. relating to a software dispute . revenue climbed 4.3_% to $ 14.31 billion from $ 13.71 billion . ibm , armonk , n.y. , remained upbeat . the computer_giant , whose u.s. results have_been dismal for years , noted_that revenue_rose again in the u.s. in the third_quarter , following an_increase in the second period . the company said in a statement that `` demand_for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide . we_do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth . '' securities analysts , however , remained downbeat . ``_i think_0 1990 will_be another mediocre year , '' said steve milunovich of first_boston . jay stevens of dean_witter actually cut his per-share_earnings estimate to $ 9 from $ 9.50 for 1989 and to $ 9.50 from $ 10.35 in 1990 because he decided 0 sales would_be even weaker than he had expected . both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ 5.81 billion , or $ 9.80 a_share , which itself was well_below the record 0 ibm set in 1984 . mr._stevens said_0 he kept a `` buy\/hold '' recommendation on the stock only because `` all the damage has_been done . '' he said_0 the stock has n't traded below 1_1\/2 times book_value over the past 10_years , which at the moment computes to a stock price of $_100 . the stock closed_yesterday at $ 103 a_share , up just $_1 in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange as the market surged . analysts worry_that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at_least through the first_quarter . `` a key part_of the question is , how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up ? '' said steve cohen at soundview financial group . `` and the input 0 i_'ve had from customers is that it still could_be a while . '' on leasing , bob djurdjevic at annex research said_0 he_thinks 0 ibm has hurt itself unnecessarily . he said_0 ibm has priced its leases aggressively , thinking 0 that would help win business . but he said_0 ibm would_have won the business anyway as a sale to a third_party that would_have then leased the equipment to the customer . he said_0 ibm has not_only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing_money on its leases . bob bardagy , executive_vice president of marketing at comdisco inc. , a huge leasing firm , said : `` to put it mildly , ibm credit has_been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company 0 we have ever seen . '' ibm is_expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes . but the basic technology in the line is almost five_years old , which means 0 it is long in the tooth , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their_own . ibm is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market , and is_expected to introduce some impressive workstations early_next year . but it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these_days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely_on for much growth . the disk_drives will doubtless sell well when they finally become available . but the as\/400 , ibm 's highly successful minicomputer line , is losing its momentum , and some_analysts said_0 sales could even decline in the fourth_quarter . in_addition , ibm 's growth in software in the third_quarter was just 8.8_% , well_below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last_year 's payment from fujitsu and the stronger_dollar . and expenses , up 7.9 % in the quarter , have stayed stubbornly high . in the nine_months , ibm earned_$ 3.17 billion , or $ 5.43 a_share , down 8.4 % from the year-earlier $ 3.46 billion , or $ 5.83 a_share . revenue_increased 6.5_% to $ 42.25 billion from $ 39.68 billion .
