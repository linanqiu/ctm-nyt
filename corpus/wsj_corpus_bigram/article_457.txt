-lrb- during its_centennial year , the wall_street journal will report_events of the past_century that stand as_milestones of american business_history . -rrb- mutual_funds arrived in the u.s. during the roaring twenties -lrb- they had_been in britain for a century -rrb- , but they_did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s . by 1980 , there_were more_than 100 such funds . besides creating a vehicle for investors , money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations . the idea was to let small_investors , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market 's high short-term_interest rates . this had_been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place . the now-standard price of $_1 a_share came about by accident . an early fund had filed a registration with the securities and exchange_commission that included a fixed $_1 price . it arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring . his successor approved the $_1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his_desk . when dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in february 1974 , it was_priced at $ 10 a_share -lrb- and reached $_1 billion in assets in one year . -rrb- dreyfus moved to the $_1 price after the sec set standards -- an_average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule . keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience . actually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the third decimal place . rounding-off keeps them at $_1 . eventually , the money_funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest_rates 0 to allow banks to offer competing yields . the new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30_% of fund owners -lrb- there_are more_than 54_million accounts -rrb- started with a money_fund . today more_than 470 money market funds have total_assets exceeding $_350 billion . -lrb- the companion tax-exempt funds add $_71 billion . -rrb- dreyfus alone has seen its money market funds grow from $_1 billion in 1975 to closes to $ 15 billion today .
