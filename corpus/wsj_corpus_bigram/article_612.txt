the 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of president_reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over capitol_hill . real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules . charitable groups are trying_to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do_n't itemize their deductions . big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible_for lower capital-gains_taxes . and heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax_credit . `` everything is up for grabs , ''_says theodore groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . adds robert juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety_of interests that want to_protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` it appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' the catalyst has_been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital_gains , an_effort that is_likely to succeed in this congress . other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have_been threatened as_well . the house seriously considered raising the top tax_rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . the senate_finance committee voted to_expand the deduction for individual_retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several_years . as_part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax_breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member sen. david pryor -lrb-_d. , ark . -rrb- calls a `` feeding_frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . the beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . to be_sure , the full senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last_friday stripped away all of the tax_breaks that were contained in the finance_committee bill . but lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary . other bills will_be moving soon that are_expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and ira provisions . `` there_is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has_been given a mighty tug , ''_says rep. thomas downey -lrb-_d. , n.y . -rrb- . `` you_'ll see the annual unraveling of it . '' `` it 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few , ''_says rep. william gray of pennsylvania , the third-ranking democrat in the house . referring_to the chairmen of the senate and house tax-writing committees , he_adds , `` next_year , every special-interest group is going_to be there knocking on lloyd_bentsen 's door , on danny rostenkowski 's door . '' many groups are n't waiting that long . just last_week , a house_ways and means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities , companies and interest groups who_want to open their_own special loopholes . `` it 's a swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty_good , '' commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings . even lobbyists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged . the return of pro-investment tax_breaks such_as those for capital_gains and iras `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -lrb- write-offs -rrb- or investment credits , ''_says 0 paul huard , a vice_president for the national_association of manufacturers . corporate lobbyist charls walker is planning a spring conference 0 to_discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . '' in reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make_sure 0 they_are n't left off the gravy train . real-estate interests , for_example , are protesting an omission in president_bush 's capital-gains proposal : it_does n't include real-estate gains . `` if there_is going_to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital_gains , they certainly want to be part_of it , ''_says real-estate lobbyist wayne thevenot of concord associates . in the house-passed tax bill , mr. thevenot got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains_provision . but sotheby_'s , christie_'s and the national_association of antique dealers are still trying_to get theirs . they have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment . `` collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets , '' the letter states . all of this talk is antithetical to the tax_reform act of 1986 . in exchange for dramatically lower tax_rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . the goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital_gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known_as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . many other tax_benefits also were swept away . this_year congress , with prodding from president_bush , has_been busy trying_to put many of these same tax preferences back_into the code . it appears likely that , this_year or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will_be enacted . other tax_benefits probably will_be restored and created . the main obstacle is finding a way_0 to pay for them . `` the '86 act was a fluke . they wanted reform and they got a revolution , ''_says overhaul advocate rep. willis gradison -lrb-_r. , ohio -rrb- . so , is the tax_code now open game again ? mr. juliano thinks so . one recent saturday_morning he stayed inside the capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to san_francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of chicago for the 30th reunion of st. ignatius high_school . ``_i 'm too old 0 to waste a weekend , but that 's what i did , '' the 48-year-old mr. juliano moans . `` these_days , anything can_happen .
