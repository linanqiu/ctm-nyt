the real_estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new_york office_space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real_estate market . in manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has_been slow to fill . retail real_estate brokers say_0 tenants are_reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty_about the local economy , turmoil in their_own industries and a belief_that rents have not_yet hit_bottom . `` there_is an unbelievable amount of space available , ''_says faith consolo , senior_vice president at garrick-aug associates store leasing inc . there_are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . `` this further confuses retailers , '' she_says . `` they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? is this the wrong time 0 to open a store ? who is going_to be in the space next_door ? '' in_addition , ms. consolo says_0 , tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower_than landlords ' initial asking price . a_handful of hot retail locations , such_as the 57th street and madison and fifth_avenue areas , have_been able_to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . and , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . but on average , manhattan retail rents have dropped 10_% to 15_% in the past six_months alone , experts_say 0 . that follows a more subtle decline in the prior six_months , after manhattan rents had run up rapidly since_1986 . the same factors limiting demand_for office_space have affected retailing . `` as businesses contract or depart , the number_of employees who might use retail services shrinks , ''_says edward a. friedman , senior_vice president of helmsley spear inc . he_says 0 financial_problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market . hardest_hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . in these locations , mr. friedman says_0 , `` retailers are increasingly cautious_about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some_cases have declined . '' weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords . it is also no comfort to landlords and small new_york retailers when the future of larger department_stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . hooker_corp. , parent of bonwit_teller and b._altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy_proceedings and bloomingdale_'s is for sale by its owner , campeau corp . the trend_toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in new_york are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents . but , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late_1970s , when their leases were signed . certainly , the recent drop in prices does_n't mean_0 manhattan comes cheap . new_york retail rents still run well_above the going rate in other u.s. cities . madison and fifth avenues and east 57th street can command rents of up to $_500 a square_foot , and $_250 is not uncommon . the thriving 34th street area offers rents of about $_100 a square_foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower fifth_avenue . by_contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in boston , san_francisco and chicago rarely top $_100 a square_foot . and rents on beverly_hills ' rodeo drive generally do_n't exceed about $_125 a square_foot . the new_york stock_exchange said_0 two securities will_begin trading this_week . precision castparts corp. , portland , ore. , will_begin trading with the symbol pcp . it makes investment castings and has traded over-the-counter . royal bank of scotland group_plc , an edinburgh , scotland , financial_services company , will list american_depositary shares , representing preferred_shares , with the symbol rbspr . it will_continue to trade on the international stock_exchange , london . the american_stock exchange listed shares of two_companies . aim telephones inc. , a parsippany , n.j. , telecommunications_equipment supply company , started trading with the symbol aim . it had traded over-the-counter . columbia laboratories_inc. , miami , began trading with the symbol cob . the pharmaceuticals maker had traded over-the-counter . the national market system of the nasdaq_over-the-counter market listed shares of one company . employee benefit plans inc. , a minneapolis health-care services company , was listed with the symbol ebpi .
