k_mart corp. agreed_to acquire pace membership warehouse inc. for $ 23 a_share , or $ 322 million , in a move to_expand its presence in the rapidly growing warehouse-club business . the proposed merger comes as k_mart 's profit is declining and sales at its_core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as wal-mart stores inc . k_mart , based in troy , mich. , recently said_0 net_income would fall for the third_consecutive quarter , after a 16_% drop in the first_half of its current_fiscal year . `` the membership warehouse-club concept has great potential , '' the company 's chairman , joseph e. antonini , said in a statement . warehouse clubs typically carry general_merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale_prices in no-frills stores . shoppers , many of whom operate small_businesses , pay annual membership fees , which provide an income base for the stores . k_mart tested the warehouse-club sector last_year with its acquisition of a 51_% interest in makro inc . but the makro chain , which_operates as a joint_venture between k_mart and shv holdings n.v. of the netherlands , has only six stores and annual_sales that one_analyst estimated at about $_300 million . six-year-old pace , based in aurora , colo. , operates 41 warehouse-club stores . the company had losses for several_years before turning profitable in fiscal_1988 . in the year_ended jan. 31 , pace rang up profit of $ 9.4 million , or 72_cents a_share , after a tax-loss carry-forward , on sales of $_1.3 billion , and analysts_expect its results to continue to improve . `` the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , '' said margo mcglade of painewebber_inc. , who had_been forecasting a 46_% jump in pace 's net_income from operations this_year and another 42_% increase next_year . `` warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off . '' but some_analysts contend 0 k_mart has_agreed to pay too_much for pace . `` even_if you_look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , '' said wayne hood of prudential-bache_securities inc . `` in my opinion , you would only pay that kind_of price if_you were getting a premier player in the industry . '' ms. mcglade of painewebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . `` if k_mart ca_n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time 0 worrying_about other growing markets ? '' she said , ``_i would say_0 k_mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss -lcb- in discount stores -rcb- , which longer-term will lead to improved profit_margins . at that point , perhaps diversification would_be appropriate . '' but k_mart 's mr. antonini is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses . for_instance , k_mart is opening big food and general_merchandise stores , called hypermarkets , and warehouse-type stores specializing_in office products and sporting goods . it also operates waldenbooks , pay less drug stores and builders square home_improvement stores . in composite_trading on the new_york stock_exchange , k_mart closed_yesterday at $ 36 a_share , up_12.5 cents . pace rose $_2.625 to close_at $ 22.125 a_share in national_over-the-counter trading . a k_mart spokesman_said 0 the acquisition would_be financed with short-term borrowings . under_terms of the agreement , a k_mart subsidiary will soon make a tender_offer for pace shares . among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares_outstanding . the companies said_0 pace would ill continue to operate under its present management .
