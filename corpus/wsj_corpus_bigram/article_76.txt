-lrb- during its_centennial year , the wall_street journal will report_events of the past_century that stand as_milestones of american business_history . -rrb- morgan_stanley , the once stodgy investment house , in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile_takeover . it was the start of a boom in unfriendly , even ungentlemanly , mergers . on july 18 , 1974 , international nickle of canada -- advised by morgan -- offered $ 28 a_share , equal to $ 157 million , for esb , a philadelphia battery maker . esb said_0 it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from inco , as the toronto company is called . `` esb is aware that a hostile tender_offer is being made by a foreign company for all of esb 's shares , '' said f.j. port , esb 's president . `` hostile '' thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon . joseph flom , of skadden , arps , slote , meagher & flom , which became a leading legal firm in merger cases , said_0 the case `` made takeovers respectable . '' esb spurned inco and within five days esb had a `` white_knight '' as united aircraft -- headed_by harry gray , a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $ 34 a_share . gray was advised by goldman_sachs and merrill_lynch . esb directors warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued . within a few_days in july , inco raised_its bid to $ 36 and united matched it . on a single day inco lifted its offer to $ 38 and then to $ 41 , equal to $ 225.5 million . united met the $ 38 but then withdrew . esb on july 29 accepted the inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over . the new gritty game became a money maker for wall_street 's once austere old-name houses . inco paid morgan an advisory fee of about $_250,000 , a paltry figure by today 's measures . early this_year morgan and three other investment houses each received $ 25 million in advisory fees from kohlberg_kravis & roberts in its $ 25 billion friendly buy-out of rjr_nabisco .
