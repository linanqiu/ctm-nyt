the market for $_200 billion of high-yield_junk bonds regained some of its footing as the dow_jones industrial_average rebounded from friday_'s plunge . but the junk recovery , led_by the bellwether rjr_holdings bonds , was precarious . no trading existed for the vast_majority of junk_bonds , securities industry officials said_0 . on friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential_buyers fled and brokerage_firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues . `` nothing traded on friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' yesterday , said_0 raymond minella , co-head of merchant_banking at merrill_lynch &_co . `` but we had a fairly active day yesterday . '' at drexel_burnham lambert_inc. , the leading underwriter of junk_bonds , ``_i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight , '' said_0 david feinman , a junk_bond trader . `` now , i_feel 0 maybe there 's a little_bit of euphoria . '' but before the stock_market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said_0 , `` you could_n't buy -lcb- junk_bonds -rcb- and you could_n't give_them away . '' yesterday 's rally was led_by rjr_holdings 13_3\/4 % bonds , which initially tumbled three points , or $ 30 for each $_1,000 face_amount , to 96 1\/4 before rebounding to 99 3\/4 . bonds issued by kroger , duracell , safeway and american standard also showed big gains , recovering almost_all their losses from friday and early yesterday . but traders_said 0 the junk_bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group , in which trades can_be executed easily , and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability_to trade without too_much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this_year . `` liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said mr. minella of merrill . `` the deadbeats are still deadbeats , '' said mr. feinman of drexel . analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will_remain treacherous for investors . paul asquith , associate professor_at the massachusetts_institute of technology 's sloan school of management , citing a pattern of junk-bond default_rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , ``_we 're now in a period where we_'re starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 . '' mark bachmann , a senior_vice president at standard_& poor_'s corp. , confirms that there_is `` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk_bond market . '' `` junk_bonds are a highly stratified market , '' said lewis glucksman , vice_chairman of smith_barney , harris_upham &_co . `` there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good . '' analysts at standard_& poor_'s say_0 junk_bond offerings by `` tightly stretched '' issuers seem to be growing . almost $ 8 billion of junk_bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from sci_tv , gillette holdings -lrb- not related to gillette co. -rrb- , interco , seaman furniture , allied stores , federated department_stores , national gypsum , m.d.c. holdings , micropolis , leaseway transportation and price communications . `` you could still have some very bad times ahead , '' said mr. bachmann . `` it 's possible to have a 10_% default rate in one year , because we_'re already seeing big problems in the midst_of a pretty strong economy . i_'m certainly_not comfortable saying_0 we_'ve seen the bottom . '' but yesterday 's rally among `` good '' junk was a badly needed tonic for the market . many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' mr. minella said_0 , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from friday and early yesterday . in contrast , he_says 0 , `` the stock_market gained back only about_half what it lost friday , and the -lcb- government -rcb- bond_market lost about_half what it gained friday . '' traders_said 0 yesterday 's rally was fueled_by insurance_companies looking_for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month . in_addition , mutual_funds did_n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected . `` sometimes a shakeout is healthy , '' said drexel 's mr. feinman . `` people will learn to be more circumspect . if_they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand grenades . i_think 0 the market is in good shape .
