it was richard_nixon 's first visit to china in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between beijing and washington . but the former u.s. president 's sixth visit to china , during which he spoke at length with chinese_leaders , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the sino-u.s. relationship . mr._nixon , the most_prominent american 0 to come to china since beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in june , harped on international outrage over the massacre . the chinese , in turn , took aim at american `` interference '' in china_'s domestic affairs . one official newspaper , legal daily , even directly criticized mr._nixon , who is normally referred to here as an `` old friend . '' the paper accused him of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase 0 to describe what china believes_0 is the policy of western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere . the tension was_evident on wednesday evening during mr._nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an_opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship . instead , mr._nixon reminded his host , chinese president yang shangkun , that americans have n't forgiven china_'s leaders for the military assault of june 3-4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators . `` many in the united_states , including many friends of china , believe_0 the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' mr._nixon told mr. yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack . `` the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china . '' the chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion . in talks_with mr._nixon , chinese_leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested_that the u.s. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring . in a meeting tuesday , supreme leader , deng xiaoping , told mr._nixon , `` frankly speaking , the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in beijing not long ago . china was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove china for it . '' despite the harsh exchanges , the u.s. and china still seem to be looking_for a way_0 to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what mr._nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in chinese-american relations '' since his initial visit to china 17 years_ago . in his return toast to mr._nixon , mr. yang said_0 the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . '' relations_between china and the u.s. have_been tense since_june 7 , when chinese dissident fang lizhi and his_wife , li shuxian , took refuge in the u.s._embassy in beijing . shortly afterwards , mr._bush imposed a series of anti-china sanctions , including suspension of most high-level talks , which could_be codified in u.s. congressional_legislation in the coming_weeks . mr._nixon is traveling in china as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the bush_administration . mr._nixon met mr._bush and his national_security adviser , brent scowcroft , before coming to china on saturday . and he plans to brief the president at the end of the week , u.s. sources_said 0 . mr._nixon was to leave china today . according_to an american member of the nixon party , the former_president raised a number_of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks_with top-level chinese officials . these included china_'s economic_policies , human_rights and the question of mr. fang . mr._nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the fulbright program , a u.s. government-funded academic exchange . china pulled_out of the program in july . in his talks , the former_president urged china_'s leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part_of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas . `` ideas are going over borders , and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of americans at the u.s._embassy on wednesday . there_are no_signs , however , of china_'s yielding on key issues . but in one minor matter , mr._nixon appears to have gained a concession . in a meeting with premier li peng on monday , mr._nixon said that he hoped 0 he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s._embassy . sure enough , when he arrived at the embassy two_days later , the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first_time in five_months . a few blocks away , at the u.s._ambassador 's residence , the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their uzi-model arms for the first_time since early june . but the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars . moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass americans , who have filed several protests with the foreign_ministry in the past_week . several_times , chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of u.s. diplomats and clicked the trigger . the rifles were n't loaded .
