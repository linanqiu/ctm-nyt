b.a.t_industries plc may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring_plan --_including the sale of its saks_fifth avenue and marshall_field units -- in the wake_of the current upheaval in financial_markets , company officials said_0 . the british conglomerate , planning its_own defensive restructuring to fight off a # 13.35 billion -lrb- $ 21.03 billion -rrb- takeover_bid by anglo-french financier sir_james goldsmith , intends_to press ahead with an_extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures . if anything , the gyrations in world stock_markets -- and in b.a.t 's share price -- since last_friday 's sharp wall_street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder_approval for the restructuring , analysts and several big_institutional holders said_0 . `` thank god 0 we have some deal on the table , '' said stewart gilchrist , a director at scottish amicable investment managers , which intends_to vote its roughly 1 %_stake in favor of the restructuring . investors in b.a.t have_been on a roller coaster . b.a.t has_been london 's best-performing blue chip over the past six_months , up 40_% against a 4_% rise in the financial_times 100-share_index . but this_week , b.a.t has_been hit harder than other big u.k. stocks -- first by the market gyrations , then by tuesday 's san_francisco earthquake , which could leave b.a.t 's farmers group_inc. insurance unit facing big claims . b.a.t rose five pence_-lrb- eight_cents -rrb- to 756 pence_-lrb- $ 11.91 -rrb- in london yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day . to fight off predators , b.a.t plans to spin_off about $_6 billion in assets , largely by selling such u.s._retailing units as marshall_field and saks and by floating its big paper and u.k. retailing business via share issues to existing holders . proceeds_will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10_% of its shares and a 50_% dividend increase . ``_i think_0 the restructuring will get the required support , '' said michael pacitti , an_analyst at london stockbroker ubs phillips &_drew . `` the shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share_buy-back . '' but b.a.t 's restructuring , which was never going_to happen quickly , now will_take longer because of the market upheaval . company officials , holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next_year 's first_half now say_0 the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second_half . ``_we are n't forced sellers . we_do n't have an absolute deadline and if market_conditions are truly awful we might decide 0 it is not the right time , '' 0 to take particular steps , said_0 michael prideaux , a b.a.t spokesman . even_if b.a.t receives approval for the restructuring , the company will_remain in play , say_0 shareholders and analysts , though the situation may unfold over the next 12_months , rather_than six . the new b.a.t will_be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the lower-growth tobacco business than the higher-multiple financial-services business , these holders believe_0 . thus b.a.t 's restructuring may only make the company a more manageable target for other corporate predators -- possibly such acquisitive bidders as hanson plc . `` the last few_days will surely slow_down the pace of events , ''_says scottish amicable 's mr. gilchrist . `` but i would n't write_off '' sir_james or other potential_bidders . among possible delays , the sales of saks and marshall_field -- which were expected to be on the block soon_after the crucial christmas_season -- may slide into the second_quarter or second_half . analysts_estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $_2 billion . b.a.t is n't predicting a postponement because the units `` are quality businesses and we are encouraged_by the breadth of inquiries , '' said_0 mr. prideaux . but the delay could happen if b.a.t does_n't get adequate bids , he said_0 . people_familiar with b.a.t say_0 possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains , and general cinema corp. , which is interested_in bidding for saks . other potential_bidders for parts of b.a.t 's u.s. retail unit include dillard department_stores inc. , may department_stores co. and limited inc . b.a.t has declined to identify the potential_bidders . though sir_james has said_0 he intends_to mount a new bid for b.a.t once approval from u.s. insurance regulators is received , jitters over prospects_for junk-bond financing and u.s. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about sir_james 's prospects . his initial offer indicated 0 he needed to raise as_much as 80_% of the takeover financing through the debt markets . market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for b.a.t 's attracting a premium price for its u.s._retailing properties . finally , tuesday 's california_earthquake initially knocked 3.7_% off b.a.t 's share price in london yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to los_angeles-based farmers , which has a substantial portion_of its property and casualty exposure in california . on farmers , mr. prideaux said_0 it is too_early to quantify the level of potential claims . he_added 0 b.a.t `` has no expectation of a material impact_on farmers .
