when rune andersson set out to revive flagging swedish conglomerate trelleborg ab in the early_1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants . `` all these consultants kept coming around telling us 0 we should concentrate_on high_technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get_out of mature basic industries , '' mr._andersson recalls . yet under its 45-year-old president , trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as_well as building and construction materials . it was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two_months as president of his previous company . but going against the grain has never bothered mr._andersson . stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive swede quips : `` it turned_out to be lucky for us . if the whole market thinks_0 what you_'re doing is crazy you_do n't have much competition . '' mr._andersson is anxious to strengthen trelleborg 's balance_sheet . characteristically , he did_n't waste much time getting started . on tuesday , trelleborg 's directors announced_plans to spin_off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on stockholm 's stock_exchange . at current market prices , the twin public offerings 0 to be_completed next_year would add an_estimated 2.5_billion swedish kronor_-lrb- $ 386 million -rrb- to trelleborg 's coffers , analysts_say 0 . the board had also been expected to approve a skr1.5 billion international offering of new trelleborg shares . but that share issue -- intended_to make trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market_conditions stabilize , people_familiar with the situation say_0 . trelleborg 's internationally traded `` bfree '' series stock plunged skr29 -lrb- $ 4.48 -rrb- to skr205 -lrb- $ 31.65 -rrb- in volatile trading monday in stockholm . tuesday , the shares regained skr20 , closing at skr225 . mr._andersson says_0 he is confident_that taking parts of the company public will_help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down trelleborg 's share price . trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less_than 50_% of both units . the spinoff should solve a problem for the parent . a family foundation set_up by late founder henry dunker controls 59 % of trelleborg 's voting shares_outstanding . but the foundation bylaws require the entire trelleborg stake to be_sold in the open_market if control drops below_50 % . that possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings 0 to finance trelleborg 's rapid_growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding . that growth is the result of mr._andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more_than 100 companies during the past_five years . most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers . applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker ab electrolux , mr._andersson and a_handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results . the treatment turned trelleborg into one of scandinavia 's_biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns . between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more_than 10_times and pretax_profit surged almost twelvefold . many analysts_expect mr._andersson , who owns 1.7_% of the company , to be named trelleborg 's new chairman when ernst herslow steps down next_year . but the promotion is n't likely_to alter a management style 0 mr._andersson describes as `` being the driving_force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting_for people to bring me ideas . '' last_month , in his boldest move yet , mr._andersson and trelleborg joined forces with canada 's noranda inc. in a joint $_2 billion hostile_takeover of another big canadian mining concern , falconbridge ltd . industry analysts suggest_that the conquest of falconbridge could vault trelleborg from a regional scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . `` trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such_as rtz corp. or anglo-american corp. , ''_says mike kurtanjek , a mining analyst_at james_capel &_co. , london . `` but we certainly like what we_'ve seen so_far . '' but trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . mr._andersson acknowledges_that the company 's mining division `` will_be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . '' booming metals prices have fueled trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax_profit to 68_% this_year from a big loss two_years earlier . but analysts caution 0 an expected fall in metal prices next_year could slow profit growth . mining is_likely to remain trelleborg 's main business . analysts_say 0 its chances of success will likely hinge on how well trelleborg manages to cooperate with noranda in the falconbridge venture . noranda and trelleborg each came close to winning falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . some_analysts say_0 noranda would_prefer to break up falconbridge , and that the swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their_own with a much bigger partner like noranda operating on its home turf . mr._andersson insists that trelleborg and noranda have n't discussed a falconbridge break-up . falconbridge , he_says 0 , will_continue operating in its current form . ``_we 'd be reluctant_to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . but such partnerships are common in mining , where there_are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' trelleborg 's president says . perhaps more_important , both_companies share mr._andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . `` if the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will_be the investment decade , '' mr._andersson says . `` the whole of europe and the industrialized world is suffering_from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he_says . `` that 's beginning to change . and investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses 0 trelleborg is in .
