another fight is brewing between congress and the bush_administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan_bailout without adding to the federal_budget deficit . in a hearing before the house_ways and means_committee , the general accounting_office and the congressional budget office , which both are arms of congress , advised the new s&l_bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working_capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be_counted on the federal_budget . officials of the resolution_trust corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most_likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . instead , the gao and the congressional budget office said_0 , the rtc should_consider using treasury debt , which is less_expensive and subject to oversight by congress . the spending could_be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the gramm-rudman budget law . the rtc has projected that it will_require between $ 50 billion to $_100 billion in temporary working_capital . the borrowing 0 to raise these funds would_be paid_off as assets of sick_thrifts are sold . the new s&l law allows the rtc to issue notes for as_much as 85_% of the value of the assets 0 it holds . but higher interest_rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , ways and means members argued 0 . `` to allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would_be irresponsible , '' said rep. fortney stark -lrb-_d. , calif. -rrb- , who has introduced a bill 0 to limit the rtc 's authority to issue debt . the rtc will have to sell or merge hundreds_of insolvent thrifts over the next three_years . the new s&l_bailout law allows $ 50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets , but that is a net cost . in the meantime , the agency must raise_cash to maintain assets , such_as real_estate , until they_can be_sold . then the short-term debt is paid_off through the proceeds of selling the assets . david mullins , assistant_secretary of the treasury , said that the working_capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad_assets , then hold the assets until they_can be_sold under favorable conditions . he said_0 it has n't_yet been determined how the rtc will raise the cash , but the administration does_n't want it to be included on the federal_budget , because it would `` distort '' the budget process by requiring either exemptions from gramm-rudman or big increases in the budget_deficit . but the worst possibility would_be raising no working_capital , he said_0 . `` if working_capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the rtc may_have to slow -lcb- s&l sales -rcb- or dump acquired assets through fire sales .
