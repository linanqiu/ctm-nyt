in a startling turnabout , members of the senate_intelligence committee are complaining that someone in the executive_branch is leaking on them . david_boren , the intelligence_committee chairman , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the reagan_administration suggesting_that the u.s. would undertake to warn panamanian thug manuel_noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination . with due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public_service . if the cia has_become a protection service for mr._noriega , the american people ought_to know . what went wrong in panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry . naturally , senator boren and his committee would like free rein 0 to blame the executive_branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their_own complicity . but there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue . and if congress is going_to assume authority to micromanage foreign_policy , it 's going_to have to take some of the responsibility too . the president of the united_states urged the panamanian armed forces to move against mr._noriega . when they_did , his commanders did_n't have the initiative 0 to do more_than block a couple of roads . the executive_branch bears the first responsibility_for timidity . but what kind_of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress ? for_example , what exactly did the cia tell major giroldi and his_fellow coup plotters about u.s. laws and executive orders on assassinations ? what part did u.s. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had general noriega in custody , but was under_attack by pro-noriega troops ? mr._noriega did_n't suffer_from any hesitation once he had the pistol . maybe we_need a cia version of the miranda warning : you have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you . or maybe a surgeon_general 's warning : confiding in the united_states may_be fatal . cia chief william webster , hardly a washington malcontent , got the debate started last_week by noting_that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed_to u.s. paralysis during the coup . the cia 's deputy_director of operations , richard stoltz , tried_to smooth things over a few_days later , but instead simply underlined mr. webster 's point . `` the interpretation '' of the executive order , mr. stoltz said_0 , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part_of operators , including me . '' in other_words , congress wo_n't let the cia do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the cia . the pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter . and of course , doing anything that might_be second-guessed by congress carries heavy penalties . witness the walsh prosecution of ollie north . the intelligence_committee 's ranking republican , senator william cohen , joined with senator george_mitchell to write a best seller about iran-contra , deploring `` men of zeal . '' no_doubt many_people in the cia , the pentagon and the national_security council have read it . what kind_of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know_what can_happen if_they fail ? who wants to end_up as the protagonist in a bill cohen morality play ? the order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action . president_bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability_to defend america 's national_security . there_are of course good reasons 0 the u.s. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same_thing as saying_0 the u.s. should start passing out exploding cigars . the world being the nasty place 0 it is , we_want presidents to have the freedom 0 to order operations in which someone might get killed . in such situations , you_can not write rules in advance , you_can only make_sure 0 the president takes the responsibility . the executive order and the reported agreements_with the intelligence_committee are neither sensible nor moral . as it now stands , the u.s. can bomb tripoli , but ca_n't `` assassinate '' colonel gadhafi . it can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the bekaa valley , but ca_n't shoot abu nidal . both the assassination order and the quality of debate in washington are telling the world that the only way_0 the u.s. will kill a madman is by making_sure 0 we take some innocent civilians with him .
