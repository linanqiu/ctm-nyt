copper futures_prices failed to extend friday_'s rally . declines came because of concern that demand_for copper may slow_down . the december_contract was down three cents_a pound , settling at $ 1.1280 , which was just above the day 's low of $ 1.1270 . futures_prices fell during three of five sessions last_week , and the losses , individually and cumulatively , were greater_than the advances . two of the major factors buoying prices , the prolonged strikes at the highland_valley mine in canada and the cananea mine in mexico , were finally resolved . also , the premiums paid by the u.s. government on a purchase of copper for the u.s. mint were lower_than expected , and acted as a price depressant , analysts said_0 . the mint purchases were at premiums about 4_1\/2 cents_a pound above the respective prices for the copper . at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five_cents a pound . all this has led to prolonged selling in futures , mostly on the part_of computer-guided funds . prices_fell through levels regarded_as important support areas , which added to the selling . the reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates_that they have_begun focusing_on demand rather_than supply . at_least one_analyst noted_that as production improves , the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies . `` demand from japan is_expected to continue strong , but not from other_areas of the world into the first_quarter of next_year , '' he said . japan normally depends heavily_on the highland_valley and cananea mines as_well as the bougainville mine in papua new guinea . recently , japan has_been buying copper elsewhere . but as highland_valley and cananea begin operating , they_are expected to resume their roles as japan 's suppliers . according_to fred demler , metals economist for drexel_burnham lambert , new_york , `` highland_valley has already started operating and cananea is_expected to do_so soon . '' the bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at_least the end of the year . it has n't been operating since may 15 because of attacks by native landowners . a recent attempt_to resume operations was cut short quickly by these attacks . however , traders disregarded a potential production disruption in chile and a continued drop in inventories . workers at two chilean mines , los bronces and el soldado , which belong to the exxon-owned minera disputado group , will vote thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today . the mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988 . according_to drexel 's mr. demler , the potential strike is_expected to be_resolved quickly , which may_be one_reason why the situation did_n't affect prices much . another analyst said that , if there was any concern , it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in chile . london metal exchange copper inventories fell 550 tons last_week to 83,950 tons , a smaller-than-expected decline . but that development also had little effect_on traders ' sentiment . mr. demler said that stocks of copper in u.s. producers ' hands at the end of september were down 16,000 metric_tons from august to 30,000 tons . outside the u.s. , he said_0 , producer stocks at the end of august were 273,000 tons , down 3,000 tons from the end of july . consumer stocks of copper in the u.s. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of september from 54,000 tons a month earlier , and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the u.s. at the end of july stood_at 123,000 tons , down from 125,000 tons in june . the high point of foreigners ' copper stocks this_year was 136,000 tons at the end of april , according_to mr. demler . in other_commodity markets yesterday : grains and soybeans_: the prices of most corn , soybean and wheat futures_contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought . buying by the soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent_weeks , but a lack_of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums . coffee : futures_prices rose_slightly in a market filled_with rumors_that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved . the december_contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents_a pound at 74.35 cents . according_to one_analyst , prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that brazil and colombia , at the pan-american summit meeting in costa_rica , had agreed_to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement . the reports , attributed to the colombian minister of economic_development , said_0 brazil would_give up 500,000 bags of its quota and colombia 200,000 bags , the analyst said_0 . these reports were later denied by a high brazilian official , who said_0 brazil was n't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas , the analyst said_0 . the colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said_0 president_bush sent to colombian president virgilio barco , and in which president_bush said_0 it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement . the minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could_be achieved during the first_half of next_year , according_to the analyst . precious_metals : futures_prices showed modest changes in light trading_volume . december_delivery gold eased 40_cents an_ounce to $ 380.80 . december_silver was off 3.7 cents an_ounce at $ 5.2830 . january_platinum rose 90 cents an_ounce at $ 500.20 . the market turned quiet after rising sharply late_last week , according_to one_analyst . last_week 's uncertainty in the stock_market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety , he said_0 , but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli . there was some profit-taking because prices for all the precious_metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance , he said_0 . the dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling , as_well , according_to the analyst .
