this is in response to george melloan 's business world column `` the housing market is a bigger mess than you think_0 '' -lrb- op-ed page , sept. 26 -rrb- . in houston , we have seen how bad the housing problem can become . unused houses deteriorate rapidly , affecting the value of nearby homes ; in a domino effect , the entire neighborhood can fall victim . at this stage some people just `` walk away '' from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market_value . but most of them could have afforded to_keep up their payments -- they chose not to do_so . the problem is so vast that we_need to try innovative solutions -- in small-scale experiments . here are some ideas : 1 -rrb- foreclosed homes could_be sold by the fha for no down payment -lrb- the biggest obstacle to young buyers -rrb- , but with personal liability for the mortgage -lrb- no walking away by choice -rrb- . 2 -rrb- encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one_month 's payment -lrb- off the tail end of the mortgage -rrb- for every six_months paid ; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage -lrb- balloon -rrb- , but `` forgiven '' on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant . 3 -rrb- develop rental agreements_with exclusive purchase options for the renter . an occupant will , in most every case , be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house . in this way , the house is not dumped on to a glutted market . john_f. merrill houston the federal_housing administration , veterans administration and the department of housing and urban_development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` buying in '' to their foreclosed properties -lrb- of which there_are , alas , many -rrb- at an inflated `` balance due '' -- say $ 80,000 on a house worth $ 55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it 's really worth . worse , the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so , but are resold eventually -lrb- because of the attractiveness of the low down payment , etc . -rrb- to a marginal buyer who ca_n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs ; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again . paul padget
