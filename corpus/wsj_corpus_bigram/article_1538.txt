battle-tested japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen 0 to visit mexico , a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore 375 years_ago . `` from the beginning , it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in mexico , ''_says kimihide takimura , president of mitsui group 's kensetsu engineering inc. unit . here in this new center for japanese assembly_plants just across the border from san_diego , turnover is dizzying , infrastructure shoddy , bureaucracy intense . even after-hours drag ; `` karaoke '' bars , where japanese revelers sing over recorded music , are prohibited by mexico 's powerful musicians union . still , 20 japanese_companies , including giants such_as sanyo industries corp. , matsushita electronics components corp. and sony_corp. have set_up shop in the state of northern baja california . keeping the japanese happy will_be one of the most_important tasks facing conservative leader ernesto ruffo when he takes office nov._1 , as the first opposition governor in mexico 's modern history . mexico , with its desperate need for investment , and japan , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match . but the two countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean . conservative japanese_investors are put off by what they consider mexico 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits . from the mexicans ' viewpoint , vaunted tactics of methodical japanese managers do_n't count for much in a land where a saying says `` there_are no fixed rules . '' japan ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in mexico , with 5_% of the total investments . that is just 1 % of all the money 0 japan has invested abroad . mexican president_carlos salinas de gortari would like to change that . the young president so admires japanese discipline that he sends his children to a japanese school in mexico city . he already_has finagled a $_2 billion loan from the japanese government . but mexico urgently needs more help . mr. salinas 's unpopular institutional revolutionary party , or pri , faces congressional elections in 1991 . for the pri to stand a chance , mr. salinas has to press on with an economic program that so_far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic_growth . but maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange_rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign_exchange . mr. salinas needs big investment inflows -- quickly . the problem is that japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming_months that weigh so heavily_on mr. salinas . `` the japanese will come to mexico , but not immediately , ''_says kazushige suzuki , director-general of the japanese external trade organization in mexico . if not now , when ? `` when the fruit is ripe , it falls from the tree by itself , '' he_says . pressed on the matter , he is more specific . `` there will_be big japanese investments probably five to 10_years from now . '' ryukichi imai , japan 's ambassador to mexico , agrees that mexico may_be too eager . `` there seems to be a presumption in some sectors of -lrb- mexico 's -rrb- government that there_is a_lot of japanese money waiting behind the gate , and that by slightly opening the gate , that money will enter mexico . i_do n't_think 0 that is the case . '' mexican officials maintain 0 the japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity . `` because of distance , it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability 0 we_'ve achieved , ''_says one economic policymaker . mexico is sending a number_of missions to japan looking_for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , petrochemicals or tourism . it is hoped that other japanese would then follow the leader . but japanese_investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not_only from concerns_about mexico 's economic_outlook , but also reservations about mexico 's recently revamped investment law . unable_to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc , mexico jury-rigged the existing law 's regulations . it created special 20-year trusts to allow foreigners 100 % ownership in some once-closed industries . it also made artful use of semantics , redefining as non-strategic industries some that had_been in the national domain . `` those devices do_n't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in japan , ''_says yasuo nakamura , representative of the industrial bank of japan . mr. nakamura cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in baja and has_been trying for eight_years to get around mexican restrictions_on foreign_ownership of beachfront property . he could develop the beach through a trust , but instead is trying have his grandson become a naturalized mexican so his family gains direct control . some say_0 the best hope for the mexicans is catching the eye of japan by promoting the one industry 0 the japanese clearly like -- the border assembly_plants , known_as `` maquiladoras , '' which are open to 100 % foreign control . ``_we must do more to help the japanese here in baja if we_want them to invest elsewhere , ''_says mr. ruffo , the governor-elect of the national action party and himself a succesful businessman . plant operators are heartened by mr. ruffo 's pledge to cut corruption associated_with the ruling_party officials . but mr. ruffo frets that an even bigger problem could_be protectionism from the u.s. , where some politicians oppose what they consider japanese efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the u.s. market through the back door .
