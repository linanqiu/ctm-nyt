japan has climbed up from the ashes of world_war ii and a gross_national product of about $_800 per_capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations . now this remarkable economic_growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern , democratic , `` developed nation '' mode of operation . until 1980 , when japan joined the $_10,000 per_capita gnp club of the advanced countries , it was a model developing nation . the government built ports , bridges , highways , schools , hospitals and railways . when industries were weak , it protected them . it gave the japanese people a value system , based_on the rationalization that given the country 's lack_of natural_resources , they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus . individual prosperity inevitably would result . that system has worked . the standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years ; more_than 90_% of the people consider themselves middle class . the people have given their leading and only credible political party , the liberal democratic party , clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years . the ldp won by a landslide in the last election , in july 1986 . but less_than two_years later , the ldp started to crumble , and dissent rose to unprecedented heights . the symptoms all point to one_thing : japan does_not have a modern government . its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brakes and steer , with 120_million people in the back seat . in a modern system , the government 's role is to give the people as_much choice as possible and to_keep them well informed so they_are capable of making a choice . it also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world . the japanese government does_n't allow this . the ministry of agriculture and fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions . the ministry of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather_than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people . the ministry of education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers , and certainly does_not act on_behalf of students . the ministry of construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that japan 's paved roadway per_capita is the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so_much time sitting in traffic . the ministry of transportation serves the industry , certainly_not the passengers who must_pay extraordinarily high prices . and the ministry of foreign affairs works for itself , supporting japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure_that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's . this ministry has done nothing 0 to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of japan 's deteriorating image . instead , it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to_expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries . all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a `` provider '' mentality ; they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumers . they serve the industries and the special-interest groups . the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing . japanese put_up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks . japan is not a political country . it is a bureaucratic country . the diet plays a minor role compared_with the powerful bureaucratic system . most bills are drafted by bureaucrats , not politicians . the diet does_n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would_be a waste of time . so most bills are passed without full discussion ; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties . a recent example is the 3_% consumption_tax on all commercial activities . this makes enormous sense in japan , where direct tax accounts for more_than 70_% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair . if_you are a salaried man , amen ! 100 % captured . if_you are a retailer , 50_% , and a farmer , 30_% . to correct this inequality , most people would_have favored an indirect tax , like the consumption_tax . but the bill was passed without debate in the diet , in the absence of the opposition . as a result , the japanese people did_n't know_what to expect when the new law was introduced on april 1 . they_were frustrated by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given as change . all of a sudden , prices were no_longer in denominations of 100 or 200 . they_were 103 or 206 . pockets exploded with one-yen coins . while people were jingling their change , the ldp politicians were caught in scandals . money , such_as in recruit 's political donations , and women , as in the cases of prime_minister sosuke uno and secretary general tokuo yamashita , seldom have caused political scandals in japan . whereas most men were a_bit ambivalent about the sex scandals -lrb- though they_were furious about recruit -rrb- , women were upset about both and surged to the polls . in the recent upper house and tokyo metropolitan congressional elections , in which the socialist_party won a runaway victory , 60_% of all women voted , as opposed to the usual 40_% . it is difficult to analyze how_much of their anger was due to recruit , the sex scandals , or the one-yen coins in their purses , but they obviously were voting to punish the ldp . taken by surprise , the socialist_party is busy changing its doctrines . it 's now ok to deal_with the u.s. , but not the soviet_union . nuclear_power plants are acceptable . the u.s.-japan security treaty can continue , sort of . and so on . against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the socialist_party the ldp has_been paralyzed . now is the time 0 to reform the government from a provider , developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice . if the ldp , as currently composed , ca_n't make the transformation , then it should split into two parties . one party could stand for consumer interests , small government , free trade and globalism to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries . the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ldp , representing the manufacturers_' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism . the ldp must make a decision immediately ; lower house elections must take_place before june . in the current mood of the japanese people , journalists and even some industrialists , giving power to the socialists might_be good for the ldp , cleansing it of past sins . we_must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial_markets . at the most there_is only nine_months before the ldp fuse burns out . mr. ohmae is managing_director of mckinsey &_co. in japan .
