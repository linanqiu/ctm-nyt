no strikeout , but certainly no home_run . that 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months_ahead , according_to money_managers and a few brokers . yesterday 's 88-point recovery from friday_'s megadrop in the dow_jones industrials had many brokerage_houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again . but quite a few money_managers are n't buying it . weakening corporate earnings , they say_0 , are no prescription for a bull_market . `` the stock_market ai_n't going_to do much of anything '' for a while , says_0 john neff of wellington management , who_runs the $ 8.3 billion windsor fund . he suspects that friday_'s market decline may_have a second leg , perhaps a 10_% to 15_% drop later on . mr. neff says_0 the stock_market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings_growth and the `` lbo sweepstakes '' -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such_as media and airlines . after sitting with 20_% of his fund in cash before friday_'s sell-off , mr. neff says_0 he bought `` a narrow list of stocks '' yesterday . with flat corporate_profits on the horizon for 1990 , money_managers say_0 price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time . `` this is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , ''_says george collins , president of the mutual_fund company t._rowe price associates in baltimore . according_to institutional brokers estimate system , wall_street market strategists see only a 2.4_% jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good -lrb- they_did soar 36_% in 1988 -rrb- . bulls say_0 the market is an incredible bargain , priced_at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the standard_& poor_'s 500 index . before the 1987_crash , the p\/e was more_than 20 . the common view , says_0 abby cohen , strategist for drexel_burnham lambert , is that there will_be `` mild economic_growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going_to be hunky-dory . our view is that we may see a profit decline . '' some think_0 investors should sell into rallies . the market `` is going_to wind down , ''_says 0 gerald w. perritt , a chicago money_manager . `` things are a little less overpriced '' after friday_'s jolt in the market . he_expects stocks to decline an_additional 5_% to 30_% , with the dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 `` between now and june . '' after friday_'s decline , mr. perritt 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by benjamin graham , an_analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis . he found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued . nicholas parks , a new_york money_manager , expects the market to decline about 15_% . ``_i 've_been two-thirds in cash since_july , and i continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate , '' he_says . companies that piled on debt in leveraged_buy-outs during the past_two years `` will_continue to surface as business problems . '' `` generalizations about value are n't useful , ''_says new_york money_manager john lefrere of delta capital_management . for_instance , he_says 0 , international_business machines and unisys might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like walt_disney , procter_& gamble and coca-cola , strong performers in recent_years . money_manager robert ross , head of duncan ross associates ltd. in vancouver , british_columbia , says_0 stocks would_have to fall 15_% to 20_% before they_are competitive with less risky investment alternatives . fredric russell , a money_manager in tulsa , okla. , says_0 friday_'s cave-in `` is going_to have more of a permanent impact_on the psyche of many investors than wall_street would want to admit . '' there_are still bulls out there . ``_i still think_0 we will have a 3000 dow , whether it 's six_months or 12_months from now i_do n't_know , ''_says david dreman , managing_partner of dreman value management in new_york . ``_we 're_doing a little buying '' in some stocks `` that have really been smashed down . '' many brokerage house officials also are optimistic . yesterday , goldman_sachs , merrill_lynch and dean_witter all increased the proportion of assets 0 they recommend 0 investors commit to stocks . dean_witter now recommends 85_% , goldman 65_% and merrill_lynch 50_% . some investors say_0 friday_'s sell-off was a good_thing , because it deflated a_lot of crazy takeover_speculation . `` it was a healthy cleansing , ''_says michael holland , who_runs salomon_brothers asset_management in new_york . from here out , these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing , based_on a company 's ability_to show profit growth . `` the fundamentals are pretty strong , '' mr. dreman says . ``_i do_n't see this as a bear market at all . it 's a recognition that there was much too_much fluff in the lbo market . '' friday_'s big fall was `` just a blunder by the stock_market , ''_says 0 john connolly , chief strategist for dean_witter . `` it was an overreaction to an event -lcb- the failure of a management and union group to get bank_financing for a takeover of ual -rcb- that does_n't mean that much to lots of stocks . '' many investors have nagging worries , however . newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real_estate loans . that hurts investors_' confidence in the economy and stocks . not even all the brokerage_firms see clear sailing ahead . `` disappointing profits are_likely to get worse in the next two quarters , ''_says mary farrell , a market_strategist at painewebber . she thinks_0 the market could drop about 10_% in the next_few months , then recover and go higher . companies with steady earnings_growth could do well , she_says 0 , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far_more than 10_% .
