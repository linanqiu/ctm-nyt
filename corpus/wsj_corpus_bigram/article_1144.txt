the turmoil on_wall street may benefit some retailers attempting_to lead leveraged_buy-outs of their specialty and department-store_chains , investment_bankers and retailers said_0 . managers at five chains have said in recent_weeks that they intend_to bid for their companies . the chains include bloomingdale_'s , owned_by campeau_corp. , toronto ; saks_fifth avenue and marshall_field 's , owned_by b.a.t_industries plc , london ; and b._altman &_co. and sakowitz inc. , owned_by hooker_corp. , which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . hooker is based in sydney , australia . the combination of so_many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & rhoads inc. and declining investor_confidence will drive_down prices , retailing observers said_0 . `` the pricing will_become more realistic , which should_help management , '' said bruce rosenthal , a new_york investment_banker with nathan s. jonas &_co . `` investors are n't going_to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . '' earlier_this year , bankers and other investors were_willing to provide financing because_they assumed 0 there would_be major gains in both profitability and sales , mr. rosenthal added 0 . those days are over now , he_believes 0 . `` competition_from third_parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will_continue , '' added mr. rosenthal . `` but when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an lbo . bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says_0 somebody else is always willing_to pay more . this is no_longer true today . '' at saks_fifth avenue , paul leblang , senior_vice president , marketing , agreed that lower_prices will_help his management_team in their proposed lbo . `` having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , '' said mr. leblang . `` it would also help us in our search_for equity partners . to make an lbo work , now we are going_to need more_than just junk_bonds . '' none believe_0 the proposed management lbos will_be easy to complete , especially at b._altman &_co. , which is under_chapter 11_bankruptcy protection . not_only could the wall_street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation . further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt_securities will_be reticent to consider additional retailing investments . `` it 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing observer . `` institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . '' however , the lower_prices 0 these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . in_addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent_on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . `` what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will_be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said joseph e. brooks , chairman and chief_executive officer of ann taylor inc. , a specialty chain . `` retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy_back their companies . '' still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk_bonds , a market already in tumult , in part because of concerns associated_with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau . `` prices for retail chains are lower today than they_were last_week , which will_help management , '' said gilbert harrison , chairman of financo inc. , an investment-banking firm specializing_in retailing acquisitions . `` but the hurdle of financing still has to be_resolved . potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on_behalf of management , or insist 0 the equity component of the deals be substantially greater_than in the past .
