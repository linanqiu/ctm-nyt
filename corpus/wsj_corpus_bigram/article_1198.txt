we_'re about to see if advertising works . hard on the heels of friday_'s 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage_firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : keep on investing , the market 's just fine . their mission is to_keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual_investors did in droves after the crash in october just days after the 1987_crash , major_brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors . this time around , they_'re moving even faster . painewebber_inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m._edt yesterday and had it on the air by last_night . fidelity_investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . shearson_lehman hutton_inc. by yesterday_afternoon had already written new tv ads . it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world_series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday . other brokerage_firms , including merrill_lynch &_co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies . the brokerage_firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone_lines and fled the market in a panic . this time , the firms were ready . fidelity , for_example , prepared ads several_months ago in case of a market_plunge . when the market went_into its free_fall friday_afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers . the ads touted fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , `` fidelity is ready for your call . '' a fidelity spokesman says_0 the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did_n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend . `` a_lot of investor_confidence comes from the fact_that they_can speak to us , '' he_says . `` to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . it would_have been too_late 0 to think about on friday . we had to think about it ahead of time . '' today 's fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity . underneath the headline `` diversification , '' it counsels , `` based_on the events of the past_week , all investors need to know 0 their_portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . '' it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name . painewebber also was able_to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987_crash . in the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage_firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night . it also negotiated an arrangement with cable_news network under which cnn would agree to air its last-minute creations . the new painewebber commercial , created with ad_agency saatchi_& saatchi co. , features mary farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish . taped just as the market closed_yesterday , it offers ms. farrell advising , ``_we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... . we continue to feel that the stock_market is still the place 0 to be for long-term appreciation . '' the spot was scheduled to appear three_times on cnn last_night . painewebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to_keep that money in the market . ``_we 're saying_0 the worst thing that anyone can_do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , ''_says john lampe , painewebber 's director of advertising . `` if_you owned it and liked it friday , the true value has n't changed . '' he_adds , `` this is n't 1987 revisited . '' with the market fluctuating and then closing up more_than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach . at shearson_lehman , executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday_afternoon . the plan had_been to make one of shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` where we stand '' commercials , which have_been running occasionally in response to news events since_1985 . the ad would_have run during the world_series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad_campaign , `` leadership by example . '' but in a meeting after the market closed_yesterday , shearson executives decided not to go_ahead with the stock-market ad . ``_we do_n't think at this point 0 anything needs to be said . the market seems to be straightening out ; we_'re taking a wait-and-see attitude , ''_says cathleen b. stewart , executive_vice president of marketing . in any_case , the brokerage_firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they_did in the fall of 1987 . but it remains to be seen whether their ads will_be any more effective . in 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse . now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . ad_notes ... . arnold advertising : edward eskandarian , former_chairman of della_femina , mcnamee wcrs\/boston , reached an_agreement in_principle to_acquire a majority_stake in arnold advertising , a small boston shop . terms_were n't_disclosed . mr. eskandarian , who_resigned his della_femina post in_september , becomes chairman and chief_executive of arnold . john verret , the agency 's president and chief_executive , will_retain the title of president . separately , mcdonald_'s corp. , oak brook , ill. , named arnold to handle its estimated $_4 million cooperative ad account for the hartford , conn. , area . that account had_been handled by della_femina , mcnamee wcrs . education ads : a 142-page ad supplement to business week 's special `` corporate elite '' issue calls on business_leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation_'s education crisis . the supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year business week initiative on education . the magazine will distribute 10_% of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
