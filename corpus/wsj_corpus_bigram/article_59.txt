mobil_corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work_force in the u.s. , possibly as_soon as next_month , say_0 individuals_familiar with the company 's strategy . the size of the cuts is n't known , but they_'ll be centered in the exploration and production division , which is responsible_for locating oil reserves , drilling wells and pumping crude_oil and natural_gas . employees have n't_yet been notified . sources_said that meetings to_discuss the staff reductions have_been scheduled for friday at mobil offices in new_orleans and denver . this would_be a second round of cuts by mobil , which along_with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work_force by 15_% to 20_% during the mid-1980s as_part of an industrywide shakeout . mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil_companies in their domestic oil-producing operations . in yesterday 's third-quarter_earnings report , the company alluded to a $_40 million provision for restructuring costs involving u.s. exploration and production operations . the report says that `` the restructuring will_take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our u.s. operations . '' a company spokesman , reached at his home last_night , would only say that there will_be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week . most oil_companies , including mobil , have_been reporting lower third-quarter_earnings , largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as_well as refining and marketing businesses . individuals_familiar with mobil 's strategy say that mobil is reducing its u.s. work_force because of declining u.s. output . yesterday , mobil said_0 domestic exploration and production operations had a $ 16 million loss in the third_quarter , while comparable foreign operations earned_$ 234 million . industrywide , oil production in this_country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7_million barrels in the first_eight months of this_year . daily output is_expected to decline by at_least another 500,000 barrels next_year . some mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified . one mobil executive said that the $_40 million charge_related to the action indicates 0 `` a substantial '' number_of people will_be involved . some will likely be offered severance packages while others will_be transferred to overseas operations .
