the food and drug_administration banned all imports of mushrooms from china in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned chinese mushrooms . `` the agency has concluded_that contamination may_be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in china , '' an fda spokesman_said yesterday . the agency wo_n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any chinese plant to enter the u.s. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in china to prevent '' bacterial contamination . on may 19 , the fda began detaining chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more_than 100 people in mississippi , new_york and pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . in subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . the outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables . a recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early march . in 1987 , china exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms , valued_at $ 47 million , to the u.s. . the shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants . a spokesman for the chinese embassy here said that the beijing government has_taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes . he predicted 0 the problem will_be solved `` very soon .
