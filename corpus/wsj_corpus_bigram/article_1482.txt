congressional democrats and the bush_administration agreed on a compromise minimum-wage bill , opening the way for the first wage-floor boost in more_than nine years . the agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional_leaders and the white_house over the wage issue . president_bush in june vetoed a measure passed by congress and said_0 he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits 0 he set early in this_year 's debate on the issue . the compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the white_house had said_0 it would accept . under the agreement_with the house and senate leaders , the minimum_wage would rise from the current $_3.35 an_hour to $_4.25 an_hour by april_1991 . employers could also pay a subminimum `` training_wage '' for 90_days to new workers who are up to 19 years_old , and then for another 90_days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers . white_house officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training_wage , which mr._bush has fought for throughout the year . `` for the first_time in history , we have a training_wage that will_be part '' of the nation_'s labor laws , said_0 roger porter , assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy . white_house aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training_wage , the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by mr._bush . the bill vetoed by the president in june , which the house failed to override , would_have lifted the minimum_wage to $ 4.55 an_hour by late_1991 , with a training_wage for up to two_months , generally for a worker 's first job . mr._bush had_been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $_4.25 an_hour by the end of 1991 , coupled_with a six-month training_wage for workers newly hired by any employer . under the compromise , the $_4.25 level would_be reached nine_months earlier , while the training subminimum would_be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . democrats argued_that the training_wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less_than the minimum_wage , while new workers need far_less than six_months to be trained for their jobs . democrats had_been negotiating_with some republican congressional_leaders on a compromise lately . with congressional elections next_year , gop leaders have worried_about opposing a minimum-wage rise for low-paid workers at a time when congress is moving toward a capital-gains_tax cut that would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers . republicans have_been imploring the white_house to compromise on the wage issue . in the senate , edward_kennedy -lrb-_d. , mass._-rrb- , chairman of the labor committee , and pete domenici , -lrb-_r. , n.m . -rrb- ranking minority member of the budget_committee , have_been working on a compromise , and their soundings showed that the senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another bush veto , a democratic staff official said_0 . the house is_scheduled to vote this_week on the compromise , as a substitute to a new democratic bill , itself watered down from last_spring 's version . the senate will_probably vote not long afterward . some democrats thought_0 they might_have compromised too_much . rep. austin murphy -lrb-_d. , pa. -rrb- , chairman of the house labor standards subcommittee , said_0 they might_have done better `` if we_'d held their feet to the fire . '' mr. kennedy suggested 0 democrats `` yielded a great_deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the white_house on the training_wage , which he said_0 make it `` less harsh . '' with only 16-year-olds to 19-year-olds eligible , 68_% of workers getting less_than $_4.25 an_hour , who are adults , wo_n't be subject to the training_wage , he said_0 . the afl-cio , which previously opposed the administration 's subminimum idea , said_0 the compromise has `` adequate safeguards , so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced .
