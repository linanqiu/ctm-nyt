the government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal_aid for victims of the california_earthquake , but its reservoir of emergency funds must_be replenished soon if the aid is to continue . president_bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven northern_california counties . the declaration immediately made the counties eligible_for temporary housing , grants and low-cost loans 0 to cover uninsured property losses . in_addition , an_unusually wide array_of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance . the department of housing and urban_development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless , the agriculture_department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake_victims , and the pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic . but the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning_up hurricane_hugo , and congress will_be under_pressure to allocate more money quickly . in hugo 's wake , congress allocated $_1.1 billion in relief funds , and white_house spokesman marlin_fitzwater said_0 $ 273 million of that money remains and could_be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake . now , though , enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief . `` that obviously means that we wo_n't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us , and we will have to consider appropriate requests_for follow-on funding , '' mr. fitzwater_said . the federal_government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how_much the earthquake will cost it . but mr. fitzwater_said , `` there will_be , i_think quite obviously 0 , a very large amount of money required from all levels of government . '' in congress , lawmakers already are_looking for ways_0 to add relief funds . money could_be added to a pending spending_bill covering the federal emergency management agency , which coordinates federal disaster_relief . more likely , relief funds could_be added to an omnibus spending_bill that congress is to begin considering next_week . but it is n't just washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin ; its relief manpower also is stretched . fema still has special disaster centers open 0 to handle the aftermath of hugo , and spokesman russell clanahan acknowledged that ``_we 're pretty thin . '' mr. clanahan says_0 fema now possibly may_have the heaviest caseload in its history . to further complicate relief efforts , the privately funded american red_cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big hugo operation . `` it 's been a bad month money-wise and every other way , '' said sally stewart , a spokeswoman for the red_cross . `` it just makes it a little rough when_you have to worry_about the budget . '' the red_cross has opened 30 shelters in the bay_area , serving 5,000 people . twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other_states . all the precise types_of federal_aid that will_be sent to california wo_n't be_determined until state officials make specific requests to fema , agency officials said_0 . and in the confusion after the earthquake , `` the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area , '' said_0 carl suchocki , a fema spokesman . still , some aid is moving westward from washington almost immediately . hud officials said_0 they will make available as many as 100 bay_area houses that are under hud loans but now are vacant after the houses have_been inspected to ensure 0 they_are sound . additional housing vouchers and certificates will_be made_available , officials said_0 , and some housing and community-development funds may_be shifted from other programs or made_available for emergency use . another federal_agency not normally associated_with disaster_relief -- the internal_revenue service -- moved quickly as_well . the irs said_0 it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake_victims unable_to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation . the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days . and the treasury said_0 residents of the san_francisco area will_be able_to cash in savings bonds even_if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period . one advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large_number of military facilities in the san_francisco bay_area , facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers . even_before the full extent of the devastation was known , defense_secretary dick cheney ordered the military services to set_up an_emergency command center in the pentagon and prepare to respond to various fema requests_for assistance . by yesterday_afternoon , air_force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies , physicians , communications equipment and fema personnel to california . a military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior bush_administration officials to survey the damage . and the pentagon said_0 dozens_of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert `` awaiting orders to move emergency supplies . '' two air_force facilities near sacramento , and travis air_force base , 50 miles northeast of san_francisco , were designated to serve_as medical-airlift centers . some victims also were treated at the letterman army medical_center in san_francisco and at the naval hospital in oakland . in_addition , 20 military police from the presidio , a military base in san_francisco , are assisting with traffic control , and a navy ship was moved from a naval station at treasure island near the bay_bridge to san_francisco to help fight fires . to help residents in northern_california rebuild , fema intends_to set_up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next_several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies , said_0 robert volland , chief of the agency 's individual assistance division . at these offices , earthquake_victims will_be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify_for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses . and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal_highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system . the federal_highway administration has an_emergency relief program 0 to help states and local_governments repair federally_funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural_disasters . the account currently has $ 220 million . and though federal law dictates that only $_100 million can_be disbursed from that fund in any one state per disaster , administration_officials expect congress to move in to authorize spending more now in california . to get that money , states must go through an elaborate approval process , but officials expect red_tape to be cut this time . keith mulrooney , special assistant to federal_highway administrator thomas larson , also said that after the 1971 san fernando earthquake in southern_california , the state set tougher standards for bridges , and with federal_aid , began a program 0 to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards . the first phase of the program has_been completed , but two other phases are continuing . the two major structures that failed tuesday_night , he said_0 , were both built well before the 1971 earthquake -- the san_francisco bay_bridge , completed in the 1930s , and the section of i-880 , built in the 1950s . the i-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting . laurie mcginley contributed_to this_article .
