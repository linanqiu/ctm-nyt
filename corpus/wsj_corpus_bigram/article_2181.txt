for all of this_year 's explosive run-up in stock_prices , renaissance investment_management inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines . now it 's on the fence . renaissance , a cincinnati-based money_manager , began buying stocks again this_week with half of the $_1.8 billion that it oversees for clients , according_to people_familiar with the firm 's revised strategy . it was the first_time since_january that renaissance has thought_0 stocks are worth owning . renaissance declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have_begun tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity this_week of treasury_bills owned_by the firm . the other half of its portfolio is_expected to remain invested in treasury_bills for the time being . wall_street executives said_0 they believed that renaissance 's $ 900_million buy program was carried_out by painewebber_inc . as reported , painewebber bought shares tuesday as_part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have_been japanese . yesterday , painewebber declined_comment . when it owns stocks , renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits wall_street brokerage_houses a day or so in advance , looking_for the best package price to carry_out the trades . the broker winning the business does_n't charge commissions , but instead profits by buying or selling for less_than the overall package price . that puts the broker at risk if it 's trying_to buy stock in a rising market . in tuesday 's gyrating session , the dow_jones industrial_average fell by 80_points early in the day , but finished with less_than a four-point loss . renaissance 's last portfolio shift , carried_out by goldman , sachs_& co. , was a highly publicized decision last january to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy treasury_bills . the sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock_market , came when renaissance 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared_with bonds and treasury_bills . at the time , the dow_jones industrial_average stood_at about 2200 . the dow average now stands more_than 20_% higher , while renaissance 's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about 6_% through the first three_quarters of the year . the computer 's miscalculation has_been painful for renaissance . almost any money_manager holding stocks has_turned in better results , while renaissance has played it safe with treasury_bills . so why does renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at 2653.28 , where it closed_yesterday , when it did_n't with the dow at 2200 ? `` with the decline in stock_prices and continued low or stable interest_rates , stocks are representing a better value all the time , '' renaissance president frank w. terrizzi said yesterday . three-month t-bill yields have_fallen to 7.8 % from about 9_% at the start of the year . stock_prices , meanwhile , are about 140 points_lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the dow industrial_average oct. 9 . are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks ? mr. terrizzi wo_n't say specifically , explaining that if there was such a move , it would take about three_days to complete the loose ends of the transaction . during that time , a buyer with the clout of a renaissance could end_up driving up the price of stocks 0 it was trying_to buy if it tipped its hand . but everything is relative to mr. terrizzi , so stocks in his view can become more_attractive in comparison with bonds or t-bills , even_if shares are more_expensive than when they_were sold in january . `` our -lcb- computer -rcb- model has a certain trigger point , '' he said . when the computer says switch , renaissance switches . the firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history . almost_all have involved at_least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio , as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category , following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation . competing asset-allocation firms march to their_own computer models , so some have_been partly or fully invested in stocks this_year while renaissance has sat on the sidelines . as a result , competitors say_0 renaissance has_been looking_for any opportunity to return to the stock_market , rather_than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in treasury_bills . mr. terrizzi confirms 0 some clients have left renaissance , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .
