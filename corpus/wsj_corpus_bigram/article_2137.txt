'' several cineplex analysts have speculated_that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part_of the company . `` all 0 this has really established is that mca and the bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they_can be bought out , '' said jeffery logsdon , an_analyst with crowell , weedon in los_angeles . `` if a bid materializes at that price , shareholders will have every reason 0 to be glad , but the question of financing still remains .

'' asked pierre panet-raymond , an_analyst and broker with toronto securities dealer mcdermid st. lawrence ltd . mr. panet-raymond said_0 he does_n't think_0 messrs. drabinsky and gottlieb are `` anywhere close '' to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again . mr._drabinsky could_n't be_reached for comment .
